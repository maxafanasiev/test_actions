Hazel Pearson was admitted into Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 20/8/21 having spent some time at a care home and community hospital before returning to Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 23/11/21. She had known coeliac disease which was recorded on her medical records. Her family had repeatedly informed staff about her coeliac disease. On 26/11/21 she was offered and consumed Weetabix probably believing it was a gluten free equivalent. This caused her to vomit, aspirate, suffer significant oxygenation and subsequent respiratory deterioration which then led to her death from aspiration pneumonia. She died on 30/11/21 at Ysbyty Maelor, Wrexham.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. Despite the deceased passing away just shy of 2 years ago, there have been inadequate improvements to manage patients with food intolerances and allergies. The Health Board has been working with other organisations in Wales to create an e-learning module and implement the use of red wrist bands for food intolerances / allergies, but this has taken far too long. The e-learning training module was uploaded to BCUHB system the day prior to the Inquest. It is strongly suspected that this was due to the impending Inquest.
 
2. The Health Board has not investigated the incident at all. A Medical Examiner Report was prepared following the death in November 2021 highlighting the ingestion of gluten in a coeliac patient. I have raised and continue to raise a number of concerns around the inadequacy of governance and poor investigation processes.
 
3. There were other incidences of gluten ingestion at Ysbyty Maelor and Deeside Community Hospital. On the at least 4 occasions at Deeside Community Hospital there were no Datix reports completed at the time. I was provided with no evidence that additional training, refresher training or induction training deals with when such reports should be made. I cannot be satisfied and reassured that all staff are aware of when to make a Datix report and how to complete this.","On 6 December 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Hazel Pearson (DOB 28/6/42) who died on 30 November 2021. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23 November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows :   
Misadventure contributed to by neglect",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 18 January 2023.

Investigations identified a pelvic abscess and bowel obstruction as the source of sepsis which was not amenable to radiological drainage. He underwent an emergency laparotomy the same day with findings of a pelvic abscess from a perforated gangrenous appendix and non-viable adjacent colonic tissue and small bowel obstruction. This required drainage of the abscess, removal of the gangrenous tissue and bowel and formulation of a stoma. As part of the pre-surgical preparations for post operative care the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) was undertaken using the right subclavian vein. A landmark approach was used. There was no use of ultrasound to assist placement of the CVC despite this being available. As part of the checks to ensure correct placement of the CVC a check chest x-ray was undertaken. Other checks in the form of an arterial blood gas and transducing the intra-vessel pressure wave via the CVC were not undertaken even though the necessary equipment to do so was available. The check chest x-ray was incorrectly interpreted as showing correct placement into the vein whereas, in fact, the CVC had been incorrectly placed into the artery. The check chest x-ray was not reviewed by the consultant who had undertaken the procedure until a later point after discovery that the CVC had been incorrectly placed. Whilst the evidence identified incorrect placement of a CVC was a recognised complication, it was accepted that the various steps detailed above that would have reduced this happening were not undertaken.","During the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTER OF CONCERN IS as follows:
Absence of a national policy on the placement of CVC’s","On 14 July 2021 the death of Maxwell Frame was reported to the Coroner for West Yorkshire (West). An inquest was opened on 28 July 2021. An inquest was heard between 9 and 11 October 2023. The medical cause of death (accepted from a report in lieu) was ","Accordingly, considering the matter of concern and the evidence given, consideration should be given to the introduction of a national policy for the placement of CVC’s.

07/11/2023,2023-0435,Gina Bywater,Mr Nigel Parsley,Suffolk,Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards),,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/gina-bywater-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Gina-Bywater-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0435_Published.pdf,,"On the 13th December 2022 Gina Bywater was declared deceased at her home address [REDACTED] in Suffolk.   Gina had become unwell at approximately 22:00 on 12th December 2022, with vomiting and shortness of breath.   An ambulance was requested via a 999 call at 00:01 hours on the 13th December 2022, but due to high service demand, and ambulances waiting to off-load their patients at the local hospitals, no ambulance was immediately available.   A second 999 call was made at 01:08 stating that Gina was now suffering chest pains, and a third was made at 04:07, but again no resources were available.   All of the 999 calls had been coded at Category 2 , with an average expected response time of 40 minutes, and a target attendance time of 18 minutes.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Evidence heard from a Patient Safety Officer from the East of England Ambulance Service identified that, despite previous measures put in place, there are continuing and regular instances of non-availability of ambulances occurring in Suffolk and the wider East of England region.
 
These periods of non-availability (in this case nearly 10 hours) fall far short of the target attendance times set by the East of England Ambulance Trust itself.
 
Expert evidence from a Consultant Interventional Cardiologist, whose unit treats up to three thousand patients with serious cardiac issues such as Gina’s each year, identified that had an ambulance for Gina arrived within the target time, the drugs she could have been given by ambulance personnel, and her early transport to hospital, would on a balance of probabilities have saved her life.
 
I am therefore concerned that the continuing lack of sufficient ambulance resource in Suffolk will lead to future loss of life.","On 16 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gina Marie BYWATER aged 36. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 01 November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 03, 2024.

The following day she developed pain in her hip and overnight from 10th to 11th March 2022 her condition deteriorated. Observations were not performed for several hours and when undertaken confirmed her NEWS score of 4. The frequency of the observations were not increased and the provisions of NEWS toolkit and the SEPSIS6 protocol were not followed.

She had suffered a stroke in 2016 and her condition had progressively worsened due to dementia. Mrs Burcham was incapable of doing anything for herself and she relied on the staff at the Nursing Home to anticipate and meet her every need and provide her with full care, including; personal care, hoisting, transfer, nutrition etc. She also lacked capacity and could only communicate through incoherent mumbling and facial expressions, which the staff who knew her well at the home had learned to interpret.
 
The Home is a residential and nursing home which, whilst accepting patients with dementia, is not a dementia specialist service.
 
On the 14th of December 2022 the Home had organised a carol concert in the communal lounge as part of their Christmas celebrations. It was attended by residents and their families, staff and church volunteers.
 
Mrs Burcham was brought to the lounge and hoisted into a standard riser- recliner chair. As she lacked any ability to support her own posture she was wedged in with pillows and the chair legs elevated by staff (via the remote control) to prevent her from slipping out. Carers then went to assist other residents to access the lounge ahead of the concert starting.
 
The riser recliner chair that Mrs Burcham was in appeared to be a fairly standard design; an electric chair plugged in at the mains to enable the mechanism via a remote control, which is attached to the chair via a cord, with a side pocket for storage of the remote control whilst it is not in use.
 
Whilst Mrs Burcham was in the riser-recliner chair unattended, another resident of the Home has accessed the remote control for the chair. This other resident had dementia which manifested itself in a compulsion to randomly fiddle. The other resident fiddled with the remote control buttons as they were accessible, unlocked and unsupervised and, without any intention or malice (or indeed any appreciation whatsoever of what she had done, because of her own cognitive impairment) managed to elevate the chair to its full rise position and tip Mrs Burcham onto the floor. Mrs Burcham had no power of speech to call for help, nor was she able to support her own weight or break her fall. She landed on her head and sustained a severe bleed on the brain, sadly dying of her injuries ten days later.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I am concerned that these chairs are common place in care home settings where residents suffer from cognitive impairment. The risks of another resident with dementia accessing the controls of the riser-recliner chair(s) was not foreseen by the Home and so was not factored into any operative risk assessment at the time; hence no measures were in place to minimise the risk. There remains a real and immediate risk that those with a cognitive impairment that manifests itself in a compulsion to fiddle and/or press buttons, can create a risk of death to other residents in the same care facility or setting. If this particular care home group did not foresee the risk then it is likely that others
have not foreseen it either.","On the 28th of December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Evelyn Ann Burcham, aged 96. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 27th September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was ‘Accidental Death’ with the medical cause of Mrs Burcham’s death being given as:

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion:
Eclipse Morrison died from Perinatal Asphyxia. Her mother had been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) after a blood test at 21 + 4 weeks. The mother’s blood glucose levels remained high throughout the pregnancy with the insulin dose being increased at each diabetic review.

He had also undergone amputations of his toes due to non-healing diabetic ulcers.  
 
His daughter, said in evidence that he was admitted to hospital on 30th   May 2022 following a fall at home. He said that he’d fallen forward and onto his knee. He was lifted from the floor and onto his bed by his family where he remained until an ambulance was called, when the decision was taken to admit him to the Royal United Hosptial (the RUH) in Bath.  
 
He was admitted via the Emergency department, then to the medical assessment unit (MAU), and then onto the Orthopaedic ward – Pierce Ward on 1st  June 2022 in the early hours.  
 
According to the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mr Nippard was initially admitted, with the diagnosis of right knee septic arthritis and an acute kidney injury on top of his chronic kidney disease. Mr Nippard was on antibiotics and on 2nd   June 2022 underwent a washout of his knee. On 8th   June he had a second washout. By 17th   June he was deteriorating, on 20th   June his CRP was increasing. He said in his evidence that the pressure sore was first documented by the orthopaedic team on 21stJune, the surgeon described this now as – the bigger source of infection.  
 
An MRI was requested but did not take place for 4 days; it was undertaken on 25th June and reported as showing no obvious sacral osteomyelitis it did show that it had locally spread in the soft tissue.  
 
By 28th June Mr Nippard was getting worse, his inflammatory markers were going up and now his testicles were swollen, and there was a suspicion was that this was Fournier’s Gangrene and there was a referral made to the Urology team. 
   
The orthopaedic surgeon said that as far as the treatment for Mr Nippard’s knee went, he felt they were winning that it was improving that if he hadn’t developed the pressure sore his expectation was that he would have been discharged. He agreed with the medical cause of death proposed.  
 
A Consultant Urologist examined Mr Nippard on 28th June, he said that he had evidence of a significant infection, that the only treatment was surgery, and all agreed that surgery was not likely to help, and it would cause Mr Nippard immense suffering in his last days. He explained that the other medical conditions Mr Nippard suffered with caused him to be compromised, if he’d had a stronger heart and kidneys then they would have operated 
 
Sadly, after discussions with Urologists, Surgeons, Anesthetists and the Critical care team it was decided that Mr Nippard was not fit for surgery, and he was placed on priorities of care and died on 6th   July 2022. 
 
It was the view of the doctors who attended the inquest and gave evidence that the pressure sore significantly contributed to Mr Nippard’s death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

At approximately 3pm on 11 June 2020, she was on s17 escorted leave, standing with a healthcare assistant (HCA) at the front gates of the hospital having a cigarette, when she turned to the HCA, said “I’m sorry I have to do this to you” and ran away.
 
ELFT contacted the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) at 3.17pm, but by 3.58pm, Ms Findlay had been found by a member of the public in a nearby park.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality.
 
That means more than simply a change in policy wording.","On 16 June 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Heather Findlay, aged 28 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today.
 
At inquest, the jury came to a conclusion of death by suicide, making a narrative determination that I now attach, and giving a medical cause of death of:
 
1a  hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy 
1b  sodium nitrate toxicity","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you and have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7 August 2023.

In order to relieve his symptoms of prostatitis and to make him ready for an investigative biopsy, he was prescribed Ciprofloxacin on 19/5/22 at a dose of [REDACTED]. 
He had no previous history of depression or mental health problems. ","During the inquest I was referred by Mr Stevenson’s treating urologist to published literature relating to Ciprofloxacin and Quinolone antibiotics and a potential rare link to suicide behaviour in patients, although I found on the balance of probabilities that it remained unclear that he was suffering from this side effect, it remained possible for this to be the case.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
•  I heard evidence to suggest that the prescribing doctor did not reference this side effect at the time of issuing the prescription to Mr Stevenson, since it was not in accord with current advice.
•  I also heard evidence to suggest that prescribing doctors may not be fully aware of this rare side effect, and that patient’s suffering from depression may be more vulnerable to it.
I am therefore concerned that this potential risk has not been given sufficient emphasis and I would ask you to consider the appropriateness of reviewing the current guidelines as to the dispensation of the drug to patients by clinicians and increasing the awareness of the side effect in order to monitor and mitigate the risks.","On 22/06/22 I opened an inquest into the death of Robert Newton Stevenson who, at the date of his death was aged 63 years old. The inquest was resumed and concluded on 25/5/23.   
I found that the cause of death to be:  
1a. asphyxia (hanging)

He engaged in repeated episodes of serious self-harm including cutting his arms, medication overdose and uncharacteristic excessive alcohol misuse. At one point, he briefly went missing when he travelled to Yorkshire – where he also self-harmed.
 
On 9 occasions during that final month, Patrick attended various hospital accident and emergency departments (in different NHS Trust areas), following incidents of self-harm. Some incidents also involved police contact. Patrick, however, declined to engage with psychiatric liaison services on these occasions and abruptly terminated a brief engagement with psychiatric assessment services following referral.

She had consumed alcohol and was in an area of Hull known for its night time economy. She became separated from her friends and after looking in one location crossed a road. She misjudged the crossing and despite seeing the vehicle still attempted to cross the road. When struck by the car she landed on her head causing catastrophic injuries. Police witnessed the incident and were immediately on scene.
Throughout the advanced life support she remained in cardiac arrest, without a pulse or signs of breathing. She was conveyed to Hull Royal Infirmary where CPR was ceased and she was declared dead.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) On a Friday and Saturday night the Lowgate area of Hull city is exceptionally busy with people enjoying the night time economy. As such many are in drink. The area of Lowgate is open to traffic, it is also the location of a taxi rank. There is only one crossing facility (aside from at either end of the road), the road narrows significantly at one end.
 
(2) Police raised concerns as follows:
–          The road remaining open during a Friday and Saturday night.
–          The number of pedestrians using the area.
–          Many people in drink in the area having to cross the road.
–          The road is a 30 mph.
–          Lights of vehicles are distracting
–          The location of the taxi rank, pedestrians having to navigate around the parked taxis, some with lights on, to enter the road. Taxis do 3 point turns in the road and any vehicle doing this is a danger to pedestrians.
 
(3) Evidence was heard one doorman working in the area who stated “Having worked at the same location for some time, the area where the bars are on Lowgate is an accident waiting to happen. Members of the public are leaving the bars in a drunken state and they just wander into the road to cross, many of them not even looking for traffic on the road. Some vehicles travel down Lowgate far too fast given the evening activity” and another doorman stated “the road and both the footpaths at the location of the collision occurred on Lowgate are both very narrow. There is also a taxi rank outside O’Leary’s which doesn’t help as taxis were parked there at the time of the collision. I have seen numerous near misses over the years I have worked in the area. It is no exaggeration to say that there are between six to twelve incidents each night between cars and pedestrians, one thing which does not help and is also dangerous are taxis which do U turns in the road once they have collected their fare”.
 
(4) The police had previously made recommendations and further felt that closing Lowgate to all through traffic on a Friday and Saturday evening, making Lowgate a total no stopping zone on an evening between certain hours, moving the location of a taxi rank onto nearby Alfred Gelder Street.
 
(5) I note the statement from the local authority listed
– They have erected 2 speed signs since the incident. Bearing in mind that this incident occurred with a vehicle travelling well within the limits, traffic is the concern not limited to the speed of vehicles.
– The council was looking at developing a document that reviewed speed limits for the whole of the city centre. Lowgate has a special reason for being an area of concern and should be looked at as a priority and not in conjunction with all other city centre streets.
– That engagement with the councils public transport department has commenced with the intention to relocate the taxi rank to Alfred Gelder street “but this requires consultation with the Hackney Carriage Association”. No indication was given regarding what was being done to facilitate this.
– The council say that there are no resources to manage the road closure, despite acknowledging it is their responsibility. The fact the road is open at this time is a danger and I am concerned given the comments of the doormen that the danger is being underestimated.
– Crossing facilities had been looked at but could not be positioned within a suitable distance.
 
(6)  I am concerned that inappropriate weight has been given to the danger arising in this area and that without appropriate action further incidents will occur.","On 2nd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rebecca Lisa KIRBY, aged 31 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29th March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Incident. 
  
Box 3 of the record of inquest read:   
On the evening of 27th August 2021 Rebecca Lisa KIRBY was out socialising. She misjudged the traffic on Lowgate, Hull and ran in to the path of an oncoming vehicle. The vehicle was travelling at 23 miles per hour however the way Ms Kirby landed resulted in significant head injuries, causing her to become immediate unresponsive. Despite many people coming to her aid to offer advanced life support, she remained in cardiac arrest. She was transported to Hull Royal Infirmary where she was declared deceased.   ",,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 24th May 2023.

Louis was born fit and well on 1st August 2019. On the 20th September 2020 he had a short self-limiting seizure whilst having a mild cold like illness. He was admitted to St Peters Hospital, Chertsey (SPH) for further assessment and discharged later that day having fully recovered.
 
2. Louis remained well until the morning of 11th February 2021 when he had a second self-limiting seizure. He was again taken to St Peters Hospital, Chertsey for observation and discharged later that day after being reviewed by a consultant paediatrician.
 
3. However, shortly after discharge, Louis had a further seizure in the early evening 17.00 hours of 11th February 2021. The emergency services attended and after a period of observation, Louis remained at home.
 
4. On 1st May 2021 Louis attended the Emergency Department at St Peters Hospital accompanied by his father over concerns of a 1 day history of being lethargic, clingy and wobbly on his feet following a minor head injury 5 days prior. Louis was discharged after observations were normal and no abnormalities, including neurological deficits, were found.","1. Management and investigation of Febrile Seizures
Evidence was heard that a number of children who have ‘febrile’ seizures subsequently die from ‘sudden unexpected death in childhood’. Evidence was provided that there should be greater emphasis on medical education, research and public information for sudden unexpected deaths associated with febrile seizures. Further evidence was heard that referrals for assessment and investigation of febrile seizures should be undertaken earlier to exclude a more severe underlying illness.
 
2. Information provided to parents/guardians after their child had a Febrile Seizure 
Evidence was heard that the NHS website and pamphlet provided to parents/guardians following a child’s febrile seizure is insufficiently informative to provide parents with sufficiently detailed information to assist them in picking up potential early indicators of a more severe illness
e.g. issues with gait, co-ordination, definition of complex seizures, developmental regression etc.
 
3. Improvement to and highlighting of the JRCALC guidelines for paramedic management of seizures in children JRCALC guidelines indicated paramedics should have conveyed Louis to hospital or contacted the GP and/or Out of Hours GP service following Louis’s second seizure on 11th February 2020, as the close proximity of two seizures indicated it was a ‘complex febrile seizure’ rather than a febrile seizure. This led to a lost opportunity to expeditiously trigger further investigation and/or a referral to either the ‘first seizure’ service or to a specialist paediatrician for further assessment and management. Evidence was heard that improving and highlighting JRCALC guidelines with additional teaching would prevent this happening again.","On 8th February 2022 I recommenced an investigation into the death of Louis James Rogers. On 2nd February 2023 I concluded the Investigation.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that the people listed in paragraph one have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of its date; I may extend that period on request.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
Although a discharge plan was implemented in Ms. Findlay’s case, it would appear that steps were not taken to contact her emergency contact and/or next of kin, such as to facilitate Ms. Findlay being supported in the community upon discharge. Ms. Findlay, having discharged herself, left the hospital with next of kin/ emergency contacts not being aware of her discharge – despite, her emergency contact being the person who had transported her to the Priory Hospital. No follow up appointment was made prior to Ms. Findlay’s discharge and no attempts were made to contact her following her discharge until 6 September 2021.
 
The matters of concern are as follows:
A.  That no contact was made with next of kin/ emergency contacts prior to, or at the time of her release.
B.  No follow up appointment was booked prior to Ms. Findlay’s discharge.
No attempt was made to contact Ms. Findlay until 6 September 2021 (some 10 days following her discharge).","On 27 September 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Annabel Jean Findlay who died aged 56 years’ old.
