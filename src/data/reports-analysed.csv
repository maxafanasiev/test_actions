3. No Consultant to Consultant referral was made as the Consultant was unable to get through to the switchboard at UHCW.
4. Mr Guillaume remained at Warwick Hospital.
5. Mr Guillaume’s condition worsened and on 16 June 2023 a plan was made to update the cardiothoracic surgery team at UHCW to expedite the surgery required but the Consultant was unable to get through to the switchboard at UHCW.

He was discharged and a taxi was arranged to take him home. On arrival of the taxi, Nicholas ran away. He was seen less than 3 hours later to step in front of a train at a local train station. He was pronounced deceased at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Training is now available for independent s.12 doctors which, once completed, allows them access to CareNotes, but this training is not a mandated condition of their inclusion on the list of approved s.12 doctors.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The evidence revealed that from at least 2019, Kimberly Liu had regularly accessed websites specifically aimed at selling prescription-only medications (predominantly medications with a sedative effect) that allowed repeat orders on the same day and did not require a prescription. Those websites included the following:
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
 
Despite the different URLs some of the websites appear to be operated by the same company and/or individual(s), in that ordering using an identical WhatsApp number ([REDACTED]) was also permitted.
 
Correspondence from the websites, following an order being placed, included messaging that suggested that the operator(s) knew that their supply of such medication was likely to arouse regulatory suspicion. By way of example, messaging received in emails following the placing of an order, included the following:
 
‘This is to inform you that usage of the name “Sleeping Tablets” during the payment at the banks is prohibited. Kindly do not use the brand name as it can be harmful for us.’
 
‘DO NOT MENTION THE PRODUCT OR WEBSITE WHEN MAKING PAYMENT.’
 
On one occasion in December 2021, the same website [REDACTED]
 permitted identical orders of [REDACTED] tablets within nine minutes of each other, without question or checks. Three days later a further order of
was again permitted without any query.
 
The concern here is that these websites, and potentially other similar websites, are not only operating without regulation, but that they appear to exploit already vulnerable individuals by facilitating an almost unseen feeding of dangerous medication addictions thereby placing those individuals in grave danger.
 
Although the inquest I heard did not concern a death by suicide, the additional concern is that these websites could also be seen to equip people with the means to complete suicide.
 
I believe that consideration ought to be given to the impact that the availability of such websites has on the population at large, together with the significantly increased risks to those who have developed an addiction to such medications or may even be contemplating acts of self-harm. I also believe that consideration ought to be given to whether and what action(s) could be taken to remove or limit access to or the availability of such websites.","On 17 February 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of KIMBERLY ANNA LIU, then aged 40 years.

pending,20/12/2023,2023-0539,James Campion,Mrs Anita Bhardwaj,Area Coroner,Liverpool and the Wirral,"Alcohol, drug and medication related deaths | Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards)",Department of Health and Social Care | NHS Improvement | NHS England,3,0,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/james-campion-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/James-Campion-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0539_Published.pdf,,"James Campion was 57 year old gentleman who had a number of co-morbidities, including a history of depression and previous drug overdoses. Mr Campion was also known to drink alcohol to excess, described by family as a functioning alcoholic. On 1 July 2022 Mr Campion contacted the crisis teams indicated he was going to overdose and then proceeded to overdose on prescription medication. He was conveyed to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital where he was treated for the overdose and seen by the mental health team. A mental health assessment was not carried out and he was discharged with the advice to contact the crisis team if needed. On the evening of 20 July 2022 Mr Campion spoke to a friend who confirms Mr Campion appeared intoxicated but appeared to be his normal self. In the early hours of 21 July 2022, Mr Campion made contact with the Psychiatric Crisis Team threatening to take an overdose of [REDACTED] and his heart medication, he also stated that he had been drinking vodka. In the light of their concerns the Crisis Team contacted the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) by 999 at 2.10am. The initial call was allocated a category III classification (attendance within one hour and 90% of calls within two hours). The Service was stated to be very busy at that time. It was four and a half hours from the original call before the case was reviewed by a clinician but there does not appear to have been a welfare check phone call at that time. It was not until six hours after the initial call that an ambulance was allocated and when the crew arrived at his home address at 8:26am they found Mr Campion deceased in the living room. The post mortem and toxicology investigation found the cause of death to be mirtazapine and alcohol toxicity. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant medication and has a number of common side- effects including feeling sleepy and in overdose it can lead to reduced consciousness and coma. The TOXBASE guidance notes that peak plasma concentrations occur approximately two hours after ingestion. It also states that the effects on the central nervous system may be enhanced or prolonged following co-ingestion of other central nervous system depressants including alcohol. Though it is unknown as to exactly what time Mr Campion took the overdose of mirtazapine, in the opinion of the expert the delay of over 6 hours from the initial call to the ambulance service to an ambulance crew being allocated and arriving on scene is very significant. It is more likely than not if Mr Campion had been in hospital at a point at least two hours after ingestion he would have survived this event. There were a number of missed opportunities in the care and treatment of Mr Campion. The family contact details noted by the mental health team were incorrect. There was very little evidence of family involvement throughout the mental health interactions, this being a critical and crucial element of the mental heath treatment plan. On 1 July 2022 a full mental health assessment should have been carried out, which is likely to have resulted in immediate support for Mr Campion and measures been put in place for further referrals to the appropriate mental health services. On 21 July 2022 the ambulance call handler did not give the time estimate of the ambulance to the crisis team member; that said the numbers for the family were incorrect and so would not have led to anyone being contacted. The delay in the ambulance dispatch prevented Mr Campion receiving medical treatment and further psychiatric assistance. The outcome for Mr Campion has been adversely impacted due to the  demand on the ambulance service . At the time of the 999 call on 21st July 2022 NWAS were operating at Level 4 of the Plan (PSP) experiencing high demand, acute pressures and high numbers of waiting calls. The options for the emergency services were extremely limited and an ambulance was deployed at the earliest opportunity. Mr Campion clearly consumed an excessive amount of prescription medication whilst under the influence of alcohol and as such his state of mind is likely to have been impaired. Taking account of his past actions, particularly that of 1st July 2022, it is more likely than not he carried out the act not with the intention of taking his own life.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The delay in triaging the call made by Mr Campion threatening to take an overdose resulted in him taking the overdose. The delay in the ambulance dispatch prevented Mr Campion receiving medical treatment and further psychiatric assistance. The outcome for Mr Campion has been adversely impacted due to the demand on the ambulance service . At the time of the 999 call on 21st July 2022 NWAS were operating at Level 4 of the Plan (PSP) experiencing high demand, acute pressures and high numbers of waiting calls. The options for the emergency services were extremely limited and an ambulance was deployed at the earliest opportunity. Consideration be given to how to support the Ambulance and Mental Health Services in fulfilling the NHS long-term plan for Mental Health, in particular Mental Health Practitioners in Ambulance control rooms.",On 02 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of James CAMPION aged 57. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 13, 2024.

Mr Parks was moved to the resuscitation area of the department and an interfacility transfer request to the Northern General Hospital’s primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) centre was made by a nurse at the hospital to Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS).   It was confirmed by YAS that the category 2 blue light ambulance was booked at 3.06am on 13 December 2022, the ambulance should have taken at the latest 40 minutes to arrive, YAS confirmed the ambulance was categorised correctly as a category 2. The ambulance arrived at Doncaster Royal Infirmary at 06.29 hours and left scene to transfer to Sheffield’s Northern General Hospital’s PPCI 06.44 and arrived at 07.15.
 
Mr Parks deteriorated during his time at Doncaster Royal Infirmary and his procedure at Sheffield’s PPCI unit commenced at 08.45. Mr Parks sadly died during the procedure at 10.17.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The ambulance response time of 3 hours and 18 minutes has likely affected the outcome.
 
There were insufficient Emergency Medical Dispatcher’s available to meet the forecasted demand. Staffing at YAS was below the requirement to meet the expected demand.
 
There was a significant delay in offloading patients at hospitals, which tied up resources and meant they were unable to respond to emergency calls.","On 25 May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shaun PARKS.

Due to vegetation growth of trees and bushes on the verge of the public highway, the tractor driver’s line of sight was obstructed, making it impossible to assess whether there was adequate time and distance to safely exit the junction. Consequently, the motorbike’s path was blocked by the trailer and the rider could not take evasive action in time to avoid the collision. Mrs Constable was thrown from the motorbike in the collision, sustaining multiple injuries and she was pronounced deceased at 1150 hours.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
In the course of evidence from the local authority’s highway maintenance manager, I heard concerning testimony as to the apparent lack of systems and processes in place to record complaints or reports of hazards or defects with the highway. Consequently, there seemed to be no way of identifying which reports had been actioned or inspected and even when the system indicated that an inspection had taken place and led to a recommendation for work to be carried out within a statutory timeframe, there was no information available on the system to show if or when any work was carried out, much less to what specification.","On 10 August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joanne Comstable aged 52 years.

Mr Perrott was on 15 minute observations at the time of his death but these were not recorded and no one noticed he was missing until 15 minutes after his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Despite the Trust having prepared a detailed report and addendum for my consideration after the inquest I am still concerned about the following :
Paul Perrott’s observations charts were not filled out adequately or at all on the date of his death
There appeared to be a lack of clarity over who was responsible for checking the observation charts ,when they would be checked by staff over the course of a working day and who would regularly feed back to staff if there was a problem in this respect .
At least one member of staff was unaware that Paul had described himself to staff in May 2020 as looking for an opportunity to take his own life if it arose and that Paul had attempted to take his own life less than 3 months previously in exactly the same way as on 31st July 2020.
(4 ) Although certain changes to policy and procedures were described to me there still seems to be a focus on risk in the “here and now “which does not
include an analysis of historical and contextual risks","On 7th August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Paul Perrott , age 34 The investigation concluded at the end of a jury inquest on 17th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide but the jury answered a number of questions which raised concern over the level of observations and care given to Paul during his time on Ashcombe Ward.","Although there have already been changes made to polices and procedures in the hospital arising out of this death action should be taken:
– To review the procedures in place on the wards to ensure that observation charts are regularly checked by ward management and concerns feedback to staff quickly and appropriately
– To ensure that staff members are required and able to easily familiarise themselves with the full history in relation to each patient they care for as opposed to simply being made aware of any risks that present on the day which may not take account of historical or contextual risk .
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5th February 2024 .

Ian fell so that he landed in front of the toilet block in the car park, suffering very serious injuries. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted at the scene by lifeguards and off duty doctors, before being conveyed to RCHT by ambulance. Ian was examined at hospital and found to have sustained multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs.
 
On 4 June 2022, Ian was transferred to Derriford Hospital for treatment of complex spinal fractures, under the neurosurgical team.
 
On 5 June 2022 Ian suffered a medical episode which developed into a critical incident in which Ian deteriorated rapidly and required life saving measures.
 
On 6 June 2022 Ian was taken to theatre for spinal surgery. Before surgery, the critical care flexible endotracheal tube was replaced by an armoured tube. After surgery, the anaesthetic team commenced an airway exchange, namely removing the armoured tube which had been inserted for the operation, in order to replace it with the more flexible critical care tube. However, having removed the armoured tube, the team were unable to insert the flexible tube despite repeated attempts. Ian then started to desaturate due to lack of oxygen. The Consultant Anaesthetist proceeded to jet ventilate Ian, the first jet was uneventful, the second resulted in massive neck swelling, Ian went into cardiac arrest. The medical team then resorted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency tracheostomy. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 20-25 minutes During this time Ian suffered hypoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen.
 
Over the following days, Ian suffered seizures on the intensive care unit and an MRI on 9 June 2022 showed extensive changes consistent with hypoxic brain injury.
 
On 15 June 2022, Ian’s care was transitioned to end–of-life care.
 
Ian died in the intensive care unit at Derriford hospital at 17:10 on 15 June 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
There was an error of omission in record keeping and in handover from critical care to surgery, and that this error likely contributed to Ian’s death.
There was no entry in Ian’s hospital notes to indicate the full extent of the critical incident of 5 June 2022.
There was a lack of information on handover from critical care to the surgical team regarding the full extent of the critical incident of the 5 June 2022. There was a verbal handover which was brief and vague. There was no formal written handover process highlighting significant events.
The error of omission was unexplained and has not been investigated by the NHS. The evidence regarding the error of omission came to light after the completion of the NHS investigation into Ian’s death. The Consultant Anaesthetist involved in Ian’s operation discovered the fact of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 on a later examination of ventilator data. The data indicated that Ian deteriorated significantly, that he was close to a cardiac arrest and the critical care team saved his life.
The surgical and anaesthetic team had no reason to suspect a secondary brain injury. The team had no information on Ian’s neurological status. Ian is likely to have suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the critical incident of 5th June. This will have undermined his resilience and ability to physically withstand the rigors of spinal surgery and airway exchange.
Had the surgical and anaesthetic team known of the extent of the critical incident of 5 June, the operation would have been delayed and further tests and assessments undertaken. The anaesthetic team may have opted for elective tracheostomy if the full circumstances of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 had been known. An elective tracheostomy would have led to
a different outcome because it would have avoided the complications that ensued from the attempted airway exchange.
I note the NHS Investigator and the Investigatory Panel both recommended that action is required for the handover of complex patients. The panel recommended as follows:
More robust and formalised handover of complex patients before transfer to theatre, to include review of airway management, cardiopulmonary status, potential avenues of deterioration and any significant events during admission
The Trust had chosen not to accept this recommendation but at the time the Trust made that decision it was not aware of the extent and significance of the error of omission.",On 7 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of 51 year old Ian Jacka.

William’s care and treatment was sub-optimal; his asthma was poorly controlled in the absence of appropriate assessment and reviews. William required chest compressions and intramuscular adrenalin in accordance with the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulances Liaison Committee (JRCALC) Guidelines with oxygen for a life-threatening asthma attack on 27 October 2020 that saved his life. William was conveyed to Southend Hospital where he was discharged home four hours later with no assessment of his recent symptomatology and no change to his medications. Family contacted the GP service for advice and chased a referral to the asthma and allergy services. No changes were made to William’s medication until 4 November 2020 when he was prescribed a steroid preventer inhaler at the request of the asthma nurse and follow-up with Southend Hospital. William was lost to follow-up at Southend Hospital following a consultant appointment on 14 November 2020. The Asthma and Allergy Service comprised of telephone calls of no more than five minutes with no contact after 1 February 2021 until 21 May. The GP prescribed four short doses of oral steroids for exacerbations of his asthma in December 2020, February, April and 19 May 2021 that were insufficient to effectively manage obviously poorly controlled asthma in a picture of vastly excessive reliever inhaler prescriptions and the absence ongoing of preventer medication.
On 21 May 2021 the asthma nurse did not review or escalate the increased salbutamol inhaler use information shared. The advanced GP nurse practitioner reviewed William’s condition on 25 May 2021 at the request of the GP following the final prescription of steroids and confirmed that William’s asthma remained very poorly controlled but failed to escalate concerns. As a consequence of multiple failures, William suffered an inevitable life-threatening asthma attack on the night of 29 May 2021 and crew arrived at approximately 00:18. Ambulance Crew could not secure William’s airway when he went into respiratory arrest with a missed opportunity by ambulance crew to administer intramuscular adrenalin in the presence of a strong pulse that probably would have delayed the cardiac arrest and possibly saved his life. William went into cardiac arrest at approximately 00:35 with further crew on scene and chest compressions commenced.
Intravenous adrenalin was administered at approximately 00:45 when William was in the ambulance and resuscitation continued until HEMS met the ambulance en-route to hospital. The HEMS doctor inserted an endotracheal tube and administered medications and William was conveyed to hospital. William had sustained a brain injury not compatible with life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

partial,27/11/2023,2023-0482,Barbara Rymell,Mrs Samantha Marsh,Senior Coroner,Somerset,Care Home Health related deaths,Home Office | Department of Health and Social Care,2,1,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/barbara-rymell-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Barbara-Rymell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0482_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-0482-Response-from-Home-Office.pdf,"Barbara became a resident of Ashley House Residential Home in Langport (“Ashley House”) on the 8th August 2022. She took up residency on discharge from hospital where she had had an inpatient stay as a result of a fall in the community.
 
On becoming a resident of Ashley House Barbara had a known diagnosis of dementia, which sometimes affected her memory. She was at a high risk of falling and had blurred vision. All in all, she was a relatively frail elderly woman with known risks around her mobility and she relied on others to keep her safe.
 
Barbara was the only resident with a bedroom on the first floor of Ashley House. This could only be accessed via the stairs (which Barbara was incapable of ascending or descending safely) or the mechanically operated stairlift (which Barbara was not permitted to use unattended or unsupervised.)
 
On the evening of the 8th of August 2022 two carers were on duty; neither of whom were native English speaking nationals; one was Romanian and the other was Indian.
 
I was told that in order to be able to work in the UK, those requiring a Visa (as the two carers on duty did) must prove that they can read, write, speak and understand English to at least Level B1…. [that they must demonstrate that they] can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work”. Applicants for a Visa must have passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT).
 
It transpired during the Inquest that one of the workers on the evening of the 8th August 2022 had never passed the SELT, so was not qualified or permitted to work in the UK.
 
At 19:27 one of the carers called 999 to request an ambulance. It was clear, on the evidence, that Barbara had been left unattended on the mechanical chair for around five minutes. This was clearly contrary to the rules and procedures of Ashley House. During those five minutes she has left the seat of the mechanically operated stairlift (possibly unfastening the seat belt) and proceeded to climb the stairs; which she was unable to safely, due to do physical limitations and her underlying cognitive impairment.
 
She has fallen on the stairs, falling downwards. There were no witnesses to this incident but Barbara has been found, having fallen awkwardly, landing with her head trapped under the chair for the mechanically operated stairlift. Care staff were unable to free her because of the positioning and angle at which she was entrapped within the mechanics.
 
On calling 999 (copies of both recordings were played at the Inquest) it was obvious that neither of the care staff were sufficiently proficient in English to be able to:
Explain clearly the nature of the medical emergency. An internal audit by the ambulance service revealed that the call-handler had selected an incorrect pathway. The correct pathway that should have been selected was “entrapment” but at no time during the call did the carer give any
information that would have indicated that this was the presenting problem. The carer repeated used the word “blocked” which added no assistance, clarity of explanation of the events that were unfolding.
 
Understand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing”. This made any meaningful triage of Barbara’s condition virtually impossible. The call handler followed the script to ask if the patient was conscious and breathing (i.e. to ascertain clinical emergency and determination of a priority response) but this assessment was severely hampered given the carer did not appear to know or understand the difference between bleeding and breathing.
 
Understand the difference between “alert” and “alive”, which presented all of the same problems as referred in in (ii) above.
 
Paramedics arrived on a category 2 response and, on arrival, it was clear that Barbara was beyond medical help. She was pronounced deceased at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I am concerned that those working with vulnerable people who are in a position of trust and responsibility must be able to demonstrate a sufficient proficiency in English to enable to summon appropriate emergency medical attention when needed. Vulnerable people, by very definition, are unable to often appreciate the need for help; take steps to keep themselves safe and/or summon help for themselves when they need it.
 
By being unable to speak the native language of England with any proficiency I am concerned that deaths will continue to arise where those who are young, disabled, suffering from a mental impairment or who are elderly and in need of urgent medical help will not have this summoned for them if those who are engaging with emergency professionals are unable to communicate effectively.
 
The Court looked at evidence of the B1 English test. Examples from the paper were as follows:
“I                      that book last year” (options are bought, have bought, had bought)
“The town,                  is very beautiful, has lots of parks” (options are which, where, what).
This level of comprehension is comparable to a KS2 curriculum being studied by Year 6 students sitting their SATS exam and appears to be wholly insufficient for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people, as demonstrated in this case by carers who were alone (i.e. no English speaking members of staff on duty) being unable to explain to medical professionals the presenting condition of the patient.","On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Jean Rymell, aged 91 (“Barbara”).

Hazel Pearson was admitted into Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 20/8/21 having spent some time at a care home and community hospital before returning to Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 23/11/21. She had known coeliac disease which was recorded on her medical records. Her family had repeatedly informed staff about her coeliac disease. On 26/11/21 she was offered and consumed Weetabix probably believing it was a gluten free equivalent. This caused her to vomit, aspirate, suffer significant oxygenation and subsequent respiratory deterioration which then led to her death from aspiration pneumonia.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. Despite the deceased passing away just shy of 2 years ago, there have been inadequate improvements to manage patients with food intolerances and allergies. The Health Board has been working with other organisations in Wales to create an e-learning module and implement the use of red wrist bands for food intolerances / allergies, but this has taken far too long. The e-learning training module was uploaded to BCUHB system the day prior to the Inquest. It is strongly suspected that this was due to the impending Inquest.
 
2. The Health Board has not investigated the incident at all. A Medical Examiner Report was prepared following the death in November 2021 highlighting the ingestion of gluten in a coeliac patient. I have raised and continue to raise a number of concerns around the inadequacy of governance and poor investigation processes.
 
3. There were other incidences of gluten ingestion at Ysbyty Maelor and Deeside Community Hospital. On the at least 4 occasions at Deeside Community Hospital there were no Datix reports completed at the time.

They were murdered by Terri’s partner Damien Bendall, curfewed to the address under a suspended sentence order, who had inflicted severe head injuries on all four, and he had also raped Lacey.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Probation Service (PS) offender records and documents.
 
The inquests identified that very concerning information regarding Damien Bendall was made known to the PS (including violent assault and injury of a partner, and an incident of possible child sexual abuse) but was not recorded clearly or prominently for subsequent PS practitioners to read and evaluate in risk assessment and decision- making, and indeed was not read at key and critical points. Although this was in part due to the recording made by individual PS practitioners it was also the result of confusing proformas (e.g. the OASys misleading drop-down boxes and the open and closed sections), imprecise arrangements and expectations of how and where such information should be recorded, and where checks should be directed and made when the records needed to be reviewed. The inquests were informed of current PS expectations for recording offender risk information and assessments, but I remain very unsure that there are clear and efficient recording arrangements and systems to ensure that risk information is accurate, prominent, easily seen, and easily updateable by PS practitioners.
 
PS domestic abuse (DA) and child safeguarding (SG) checks
 
The inquests identified that DA and SG checks were either insufficient or wholly lacking at various stages of Damien Bendall’s offender management. The current evidence is that DA and SG checks remain generally insufficient or are not being done with consequent on-going risks to children and women.
 
Insufficient or absent PS DA and SG checks has been a theme of HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and reviews for at least the last 5 years. On HM Inspectorate of Probation case sampling to determine whether domestic abuse and child safeguarding enquiries were being undertaken when indicated, the HM Inspectorate of Probation Annual Report for 2022/2023 states at page 38: –
 
where inspectors judged that these enquiries needed to be made by the probation practitioner, child safeguarding enquiries were carried out in 55 per cent of cases, domestic abuse enquiries were only carried out in 49 per cent of cases and risk of harm was only properly addressed in 39 per cent.
 
The PS is not currently conducting SG checks in all cases where an offender will live with or have access to children.
 
The PS has mandated that in all cases where a curfew condition is proposed to the court in a pre-sentence report (PSR) DA and SG checks will be conducted prior to the proposal and submission of the PSR: this is not being done in all cases. I am also unclear whether contact to the address homeowner/lead tenant for a potential curfew condition to discuss the suitability of a curfew condition is being undertaken in all cases.
 
Relatedly, although I have not taken evidence on this wider issue, it appears to me that the systems for conducting DA and SG checks are generally severely strained. I say this because as an example the PS has now employed staff to make the checks from police records and has had to do this because the police service itself is unable to check and provide the information to the PS within necessary timeframes.
 
PS PSR reports
 
There is no evidence that DA and SG checks were made by the PS practitioner in respect of Damien Bendall’s PSR report. Via the report the court was informed that checks had been conducted. The PS practitioner put forward a curfew provision as appropriate and the report was written in such a way to indicate that the report writer had checked the suitability of the curfew address, when she had not in fact done so. Had the court not been misled it is unlikely that the court’s disposal would have included a curfew requirement.
 
The inquests heard that PSRs written by the same PS practitioner, reviewed before her submission of Damien Bendall’s PSR, and reports reviewed after the murders, also lacked evidence of DA and SG checks having been made even though they were stated to have been done in the reports.
 
Evidence from senior PS staff was to the effect that failing to undertake the checks and failure to make this explicitly clear in a PSR might be dealt with by management feedback to the PS practitioner but is an unlikely to be a disciplinary matter. This leads me to question whether, given the potentially very disastrous outcomes in terms of public protection, the PS is failing to grasp the seriousness of the issue, to make this explicit to PS practitioners, and ensure that there are commensurate penalties for staff where these professional duties have been breached.
 
PS DA and SG training
 
A significant issue in the inquests was the fact that the very inexperienced staff who were (wrongly) allocated Damien Bendall’s case on transfer to the East Midlands PS region had insufficient DA and SG training. The PS states it has introduced more robust DA and SG training, but it is unclear whether PS practitioners are receiving this before cases are allocated to them to manage.
 
Reporting concerns to the PS by the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS)
 
Damien Bendall made the comment “if this relationship goes bad I’ll murder my girlfriend and the children” to the EMS field operative who fitted his tag and monitoring equipment but this was not reported back by the field operative to her manager nor to the PS. EMS has stated that it has introduced relevant training but the inquest heard evidence from the field operative that comments made by offenders which can be interpreted as potentially posing risk are currently routinely not being reported back by EMS field operatives.
 
The inquests examined the relevant contract terms between the Ministry of Justice and Capita (EMS) relating to reporting concerns and there did appear to be lack of clarity on reporting mechanisms and issues to report.
 
Notification of missed substance misuse appointments to the PS
 
In Derbyshire the substance misuse services provided to offenders where there is a court-imposed sentence requirement for such services is provided under the auspices of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS FT. Damien Bendall was subject to an alcohol treatment requirement. The precise number is not clear on the records, but he missed 4 or 5 appointments with the service between 21 July and his first attended appointment on 17 September 2021, but the required proforma attendance/non-attendance forms were not sent by the substance misuse service to notify the PS.","On 23 September 2021 I commenced investigations into the deaths of Terri Liz Harris aged 35, her children John-Paul Bennett and Lacey Bennett, aged 13 and 11 respectively, and their friend Connie Gent aged 11.

He underwent an endoscopy on 18 August 2022 where biopsies were taken. The results showed abnormal cells. On 15 September, Mr Di Blasi was referred by a GP to the Lower Gastro-intestinal team for possible bowel cancer and had a CT scan on 4 November 2022. The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the
report until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022. The incidental findings were not considered to be ‘significant’ by the Radiologists and were not therefore warrant an alert being sent to the referring clinician, leaving the report to be reviewed when they were able to. My investigation revealed that the timeframe for seeing patients on the cancer referral pathway is the date of the first appointment and there are no other target dates in respect of investigations of subsequent treatment.
 
Mr Di Blasi underwent a further endoscopy on 30 November 2022. The Endoscopist was unaware of these incidental findings. A biopsy was taken from an area which looked abnormal but was actually a gastric varix. As a result of this, Mr Di Blasi suffered a massive bleed and despite maximal supportive measures, he died on 1 December 2022 at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8HW.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
(1)  That one of the teams caring for Mr Di Blasi was completely unaware of the input from another specialty team, despite both referrals being made under the 2-week urgent referral pathway. The lack of communication between these teams meant that timely sharing of results did not occur. Even the very knowledge of the fact that a CT scan had taken place would have alerted the endoscopist to check those results, and it is likely that the second endoscopy would not have gone ahead. I understand this to be a national issue and is likely to apply to other investigations being carried out.
 
(2)  That the reporting timeframes on the 2-week urgent cancer pathway referral does not take into account timeframes for reporting investigative procedures or subsequent review by the referring clinicians.
 
(3)  The current training for Endoscopists for JAG certification requires the performance
of 200 endoscopies. However, these tend to focus on the clinician’s area of specialty and therefore there is a danger that lesion recognition will be limited and insufficient to ensure that endoscopists are able to recognise less frequently occurring lesions. With the need for an increasing number of endoscopists, action should be taken.",On 13th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Calogero Di Blasi.

He was 79 years old. He had fallen the morning before, at home, and had remained on the floor until admittance to the ED at approximately 05:32 on the 20th December 2022. He had made a first call to the East of England Ambulance Service at around 7:29 pm on the 19th December 2022. The call was allocated a C2 category which aims to have an urgent response within an 18 minute time frame. The EEAS was extremely busy that night with previously unseen levels of C2 allocations of ambulances. In addition, the hospitals in the area were queuing ambulances outside ED’s because they were unable to offload patients and then proceed to other calls. That combination meant that despite being allocated an urgent response time Mr Vincent was effectively left on the floor for a very prolonged time. Ultimately he had a cardiac arrest at home and an ambulance attended promptly. He was resuscitated but the “down time” was prolonged. He died as a result of a combination of an undiagnosed bronchopneumonia complicated by severe coronary artery disease and a long lie. On the balance of probabilities it is likely that had he been admitted at the time of the first call he would not have died at the time he did.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Mr Vincent had fallen many hours prior to making his first call to the ambulance service. There then followed a further ten hour delay, during which time he had a cardiac arrest, before he was admitted to the Emergency Department. He had been allocated an appropriate response time, expected within 18 minutes at 1929 on the 19th December 2022. For the reasons given in the circumstances above, that target was missed by an enormous margin. There is a strong possibility, even arguably a probability that another frail, elderly individual, will have the same experience. Long lie after a fall, especially in the elderly often results in a terminal kidney injury and death. Consideration should be given to review of how these types of emergency call are managed and thereafter monitored.",On 09 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John VINCENT aged 79.

Mr Gale was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was seen regularly by mental health professionals and was in frequent contact with mental health services. Those services were provided by Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Gale was compliant with his medication and engaged with services. He was well supported by his family and friends.
 
Mr Gale’s anxiety continued during his engagement with mental health services. Evidence was heard about what caused Mr Gale’s anxiety. One ongoing feature was his application for Universal Credit.
 
On 2 March 2023, 2 days before his death, Mr Gale was seen by an Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the inquest. The Psychiatrist considered Mr Gale’s anxiety was exacerbated by his application for Universal Credit. During Mr Gale’s appointment, the Psychiatrist called the benefits office for help but the call was not answered before the end of the consultation. Mr Gale was expecting a call from a DWP representative the next day (3 March).
 
On 3 March 2022 at approximately 11:00 am, Mr Gale spoke to the duty Registered Mental Health Nurse. He remained very anxious and his main concern was the application for Universal Credit.
 
During their evidence, the Associate Specialist Psychiatrist expressed concerns about the experience of mental health service users with DWP. These concerns were not just specific to Mr Gale.
 
Evidence was also given by the Trust’s Group Nurse Director (a Registered Mental Health Nurse) who considered that the issues identified by the Psychiatrist were national. The Director considered it important to address these issues as they were debilitating for service users.
 
The Director advised that the Trust’s Crisis Team had started a food bank 3 years ago to support service users. The Director was also aware that the DWP had been invited to the Cumbria Suicide Prevention Group.
 
I stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Gale’s death and his anxiety about his Universal Credit application. DWP was not an Interested Person in Mr Gale’s inquest and did not give evidence as the concerns raised did not come to light until the hearing.","The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms. I heard evidence that:
 
1.     The number of and length of DWP forms required to be completed can be overwhelming for someone with a mental health illness. This is perpetuated if the applicant cannot get help to complete the paperwork.
2.     There are long telephone queues to speak to a DWP advisor.
3.     Having to travel long distances for appointments can be detrimental for those with a mental health illness.","Mr Kevin Conrad GALE died on 4 March 2022 at his home address.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Whilst the jury did not make any finding of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in this case, much evidence was heard about the training in identification of the signs and symptoms. National training of police officers on the identification of ABD is focused on a triad of warning flags being, hot to touch, exhibiting constant or near constant activity and extreme agitation or aggression. Some evidence identified that Carl Fullalove did not exhibit these triad symptoms but did exhibit other nuanced symptoms in the long list delivered in training. It was evident that his symptoms were not recognised as ABD due to drug intoxication, and that the consequential risks associated with prone restraint were not therefore considered. Prone restraint ultimately led to his death. There were six experts providing evidence to the inquest two of whom identified that Carl would not have died had he been recognised as unwell at the point of arrest and assessed by a health care practitioner. Such attention would have provided a calming intervention for his heart rate and breathing prior to being placed in prone restraint, which exerted additional pressure on his ability to breath freely.
 
A research paper before the inquest, namely ‘Consensus on Acute Behavioural Disturbance in the UK, September 2023 recommends that the focus remain on the triad of warning signs. ABD is clearly difficult to distinguish from drug intoxication by a non-medical practitioner. The rigidity of the training with focus on specific symptoms can cause police officers to miss other signs. The Superintendent, and head of ‘Protecting Vulnerable People’ for Cheshire accepted that with hindsight the use of prone restraint was inadvisable in this case.
 
Significant training on ABD had been delivered by Cheshire Constabulary through the College of Policing Personal Safety Training package module, the key to which was to identify an underlying medical condition to refer to a health care practitioner. That may be a lot to expect of police officers in a dynamic fast paced setting. The use of the term ABD may be a distraction.
 
The effect of stimulant drugs and the need for calming de-escalation in an upright position, rather than prone restraint, had not been noted in either the training material or the research paper presented to the Court. This is on the background of recognising from College of Policing guidance that a high percentage of deaths in prone restraint are in drug related cases.
 
The First Aid Learning Programme (FALP) will be in place within Forces by April 2024 and includes amongst other things positional asphyxia, unconscious and not breathing, and ABD but does not mention training in calming intervention that on balance of probabilities may have led to a different outcome in this case.",On 04 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carl FULLALOVE aged 29.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1.     The concerns within the hospital and non-compliance with the LRCP protocol has been addressed by way of an investigation & action plan.
 
2.     The nurse at the practice told the Inquest, the procedure for practice staff calling 999 (not leaving it to the patient) in the event of a patient with chest pain and other life threatening conditions applied only to reception staff and not to nursing staff. This led to inconsistency and in this case an avoidable delay in summoning urgent medical assistance and needs reviewing/all staff working in/working on behalf of the practice need to be aware of the procedure to be followed, consideration must be given as to whether it is appropriate to have different standards for qualified nursing and administrative/non qualified nursing staff. The awareness of Dissecting Aortic Aneurysm and the rapidity at which the condition can become catastrophic/fatal also needs raising within the practice.
 
The nurse within the practice who spoke with Wayne on the date of his death on behalf of the practice , did not escalate to a doctor, did not call 999, she did not inform the NOK of her concerns, she did not call back to see if Wayne had called for an ambulance/attended hospital and she did not alert the hospital of her suspicions

This was effective in controlling his mental health difficulties. Patients taking clozapine require close monitoring of their physical health due to the risks associated with the medication and attend a 4-weekly clinic. Blood samples are taken at these clinics to monitor white blood cell counts.   ,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1 The abnormal triglyceride levels in Mr Daniel’s blood, whilst reported by the lab, were not escalated by telephone as this was not required by the hospital procedure at the time.
 
I am pleased to note that Hampshire Hospitals Trust have updated their procedures to include telephone escalation of raised triglyceride levels.
 
However the RCA report indicated that the findings in this case should be shared with the Royal College of Pathologists with a request that raised triglyceride levels be added to the RCPath guidelines for telephone action. In information received after the inquest the Hampshire Hospitals Trust advised that they could not tell me whether or not this action has been undertaken.
 
2.  The RCA report identifed that the format of discharge summaries provided to GPs by the ED department needed to be reviewed to ensure that actions to be undertaken by GPs were clearly identified. The results of this were to be audited.
 
Following the inquest I was provided with an audit report. This report dated 13/9/21 revealed that the computer system could not be altered as had been hoped and therefore a change of practice was introduced instead. This required clinicians to document actions in a free text section with appropriate flagging for GPs.  20 cases were audited and only half met the standardised national guidance and 8 lacked a clear diagnosis & details of what was expected from GPs.
 
Hamsphire Hospital Trust have informed me that further actions are being taken to address these deficiencies. However as it is now a year since the RCA report was prepared and over 2 years since Mr Daniel’s death I am concerned that this action is not being taken swiftly given the risks to patients.
 
3.  In relation to the blood tests required under the clozapine guidelines I was informed that Southern Health take the monthly blood tests and run these in the clozapine clinic. However the blood tests required of the annual physical health checks are not taken by the Southern Health staff but rather patients are required to attend phlebotomy services elsewhere for the blood to be taken.
 
I heard evidence during the inquest that Mr Daniels had missed some of these blood test appointments which meant his full tests were not carried out when expected. Clozapine is prescribed only to patients suffering from an enduring mental health condition for whom other medication has not been effective which indicates that they may be at risk of having difficulty managing appointments.","On 08 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sebastian Harry DANIELS aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 01 September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:   On the 4th July 2021 Sebastian Harry Daniels died at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester. He died as a result of a hypertriglyceridemia caused by his diabetes, obesity and medication that he required to control his enduring mental health condition. This condition was identified during a blood test on the 30th April 2021 but the result was passed on in a manner which did not trigger a medical review.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by November 17, 2023.

Background
·       I heard evidence that when Ms GARLAND was on the Cardiac High Dependency Unit ‘HDU’ (part of the Intensive Care Unit) she was receiving intravenous antibiotics
·       When she then transferred from HDU to the Cardiac Ward there was a transcription error, and these antibiotics were accidentally omitted from the list of medications that she should be given on the new ward
·       As a result Ms GARLAND’s antibiotics were discontinued accidentally
·       I heard (and accepted) evidence that it would have been reasonable to discontinue antibiotics in any event at the time of Ms GARLAND’s transfer
·       Notwithstanding that fact, I remain deeply concerned by the circumstances in which the error took place
My concerns
 
·       I heard evidence from an ICU Consultant (who I found to be both a reliable and an impressive witness), who told me, among other things, that:
–        “… Transcription errors have always been a problem…” the ideal way to get rid of them would be to have a system [in the rest of the hospital] that speaks to ours
–        The ICU retains lists of its patients’ medication on a computerised/electronic system
–        The rest of the wards in the hospital do not operate the same system
–        The available systems do not speak to each other (to put it in somewhat colloquial terms)
–        Efforts to address that problem have proved fruitless
–        As a result, every time an inpatient moves from ICU to another department in the hospital, an appropriately qualified member of staff has to physically transcribe that patient’s medication list
–        With (for instance) 10 patients moving per day, 15-20 medications per patient, and multiple elements for each medication (name; dose; timing; indication; start date; signature etc.), “at a conservative estimate 1,500 to 2,000 elements [are transcribed] daily”
(Coroner’s comment: for obvious reasons this creates enormous potential for human error)
–        There are a limited number of people who can prescribe (and are therefore
able to perform this task); in critical care they are the same people who are responsible for providing care
–        “We really need a second check… funding for more pharmacists… as a Trust we’ve fallen short of ICU national standards for years in terms of the number of pharmacists per bed and medicines reconciliation”
–        “I spoke to the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer – he has submitted 5 proposals in the last 7 years to try to get the deficit funded… [without success]”
 
In summary, my view is that the circumstances currently in place create a very real (and known) risk that transcription errors will continue to occur. This in turn endangers patients, and creates a risk that people will die in the future as a result of such errors.
 
It is, sadly, very easy to envisage circumstances in which a patient might not receive essential medication at all, might receive the wrong dose of the medication they need, or might receive the wrong medication altogether, because of a transcription error.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.","On 31 October 2022 an investigation commenced into the death of Ms Cherry Lynne GARLAND, aged 77.

·      This inquest was about a man who, aged 90, died whilst waiting to be seen by  a medical professional in hospital. He did not simply arrive at hospital,  but   had been assessed and then sent there by his GP, who felt, rightly as it turned out, that Derek may have developed an obstruction. He was anticipating   Derek would be seen quickly.
 
·      He arrived at the Emergency Department, and handed in some paperwork at reception and understandably expected he would not have to wait long to be assessed by doctors who he knew were expecting him.
 
·      No-one called for him for almost two hours by which time he had died.
 
·      It is correct to say that once a post mortem examination was performed, it was clear that even if he had been assessed immediately upon arrival at hospital his condition was such that surgical intervention was not a realistic possibility and the condition was going to prove terminal.
 
·      At the time Derek arrived, as the Hospital Trust’s own internal review of this death explained, such were the pressures on the hospital Trust posed by patient numbers that it was operating at OPEL [Operations Pressure Escalation Level] 4. This is a method used by the NHS to measure the stress, demands, and pressure a hospital is under. OPEL 4 represents the highest level, when a hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient
safety is at risk”.","During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
·      Concern 1 – that the medical professionals who work in a hospital emergency department are routinely expected to do so when the OPEL 4 applies, a recognition they are performing their roles when the hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient safety is at risk”. Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.
 
·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for. There is a clear risk that puts patients at risk and it would be remiss of me not to raise it.
 
·      Concern 3 – Finally, it is relevant to point out that Derek had not moved for    some time before a medical professional called for Derek.  I  formed the  view that there had been a reluctance on his Friend’s part to request assistance due   to the pressures staff were clearly under, but also because he had already  handed in Derek’s paperwork and was expecting some assistance imminently which did not arrive. I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures.","The death of Harold Derek PEDLEY Otherwise known as Derek PEDLEY on 21.12.22 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th August 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

On 6 November 2022, Audrey was admitted to RCHT with abdominal pain secondary to femoral hernia obstruction. The apixaban was suspended pending surgery. Audrey underwent surgery for femoral hernia repair, that same day, 6 November 2022. The operation was uneventful.
 
On 9 November 2022 the eldercare consultant reviewed Audrey. The review notes were handwritten on paper medical notes. The eldercare consultant recommended that the surgical team restart Apixaban as soon as safe post operatively.
 
The court heard evidence that the NICE guidance on this subject states
 
Stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation; Post procedure with immediate and complete haemostasis NOACs can generally be resumed 6–8 h after the end of the intervention. Some surgical interventions carry increased bleeding risk in which case resume anticoagulation 48–72 h post procedure but at the earliest opportunity
 
The apixaban was not restarted.
 
On 11 November 2022 Audrey had a severe stroke secondary to AF. Audrey died as a result of this complication four days later.
 
The court found that whether and when to re-start the apixaban was a decision for the surgical team. The court heard that on the consultant surgeon’s ward round his junior doctor colleague was briefing him, this included reference to the eldercare review paper notes. The junior doctor went through a number of aspects regarding care and treatment but did not refer to the recommendation to re-start apixaban. As a result, the consultant surgeon did not consider whether or not to re-start the apixaban.
 
The court heard that the eldercare team use paper medical notes whilst the surgical team use a digital system, known as NerveCentre. The consultant surgeon stated that the digital system is easier for the surgical team to read because the consultant surgeons can look at the detail on their phone or iPad. The consultant surgeon considered that the different recording platforms contributed to the error of omission in Audrey’s case.
 
Where an ‘important clinical note’ has been handwritten in the handwritten record there is facility for highlighting this on the ‘ward round’ function on Nerve centre. There was no alert that clinical notes had been handwritten in the written notes following the review by the eldercare consultant on 9th November.
 
The court found that apixaban was prescribed on admission and correctly suspended due to bleeding risk in light of pending surgery. There is no evidence of review of this suspension in either medicines reconciliation (10th November) or in the medical records. The court heard that there is no automatic flag on the Electronic Prescribing Medication Administration (EPMA) requiring review of the ongoing suspension of prescribed medication.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

He had owned his plane, a Cap- 10-B since 2014. He had a current and valid private pilot’s licence which permitted him to fly under Visual Flight Rules (“VFR”). Mr Mann did not possess the skills, experience of ability to fly in cloud; he could only fly in clear skies as he was unable to “instrument fly” and could only fly by reference to what he could see out of the window.
 
His passenger on the day, Mrs Costa, had no flying experience and did not possess a pilot’s licence. She had no active part in the events that unfolded.
 
On 12th August 2021 at 08:04 Mr Mann took off from Watchford Farm, Yarcombe near Taunton, Somerset with Mrs Costa on a planned pleasure trip for the day to the Isle of Sicily. There was no evidence that Mr Mann had used recognised aviation sources to check the weather prior to departure, instead obtaining weather information from news weather-based apps.
 
At around 09:10 the weather conditions deteriorated and so Mr Mann turned back. At around 10:10 found himself at an altitude of 7,500ft flying above cloud, He was not qualified to fly through cloud. He contacted the Distress and Diversion Cell (“D&D Cell”) on the emergency frequency for assistance.
 
Mr Mann began to descend to a lower altitude but he appears to have become spatially disorientated due to the extreme stress of flying in the weather conditions in which he found himself and when he emerged from cloud, the ground was not where he expected it to be. The plane collided with a large oak tree at Lower Colley Farm, Buckland St Mary near Chard, Somerset and was destroyed on impact with both the pilot and passenger being thrown from the wreckage and suffering catastrophic injuries that were incompatible with life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The D&D cell did not request or receive any critical information about
(i)   the pilot’s capabilities (i.e that he could not instrument fly and/or fly in cloud);
(ii)   the plane’s capabilities (i.e. that it was not equipped to allow the pilot to instrument fly)
(iii)   the weather conditions at the selected diversion aerodrome (to ensure that the weather was more favourable to the conditions at the home aerodrome).
 
Checklists and aide memoires were not used by those on the ground and, consequently, there was a lack of knowledge and/or appreciation of the unsuitability of the selected airport (Exeter) as a viable diversion destination;
despite it being the closest in geographic proximity. There was no immediate requirement for urgent assistance as the pilot had fuel for a further 1.5hours of","On the 16th September 2021, my predecessor, Mr Tony Williams, commenced an investigation into the deaths of Jonathan Paul Bost Mann, aged 69 and Margaret Jean Costa, aged 74.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19th October 2023.

He had also undergone amputations of his toes due to non-healing diabetic ulcers.  
 
His daughter, said in evidence that he was admitted to hospital on 30th   May 2022 following a fall at home. He said that he’d fallen forward and onto his knee. He was lifted from the floor and onto his bed by his family where he remained until an ambulance was called, when the decision was taken to admit him to the Royal United Hosptial (the RUH) in Bath.  
 
He was admitted via the Emergency department, then to the medical assessment unit (MAU), and then onto the Orthopaedic ward – Pierce Ward on 1st  June 2022 in the early hours.  
 
According to the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mr Nippard was initially admitted, with the diagnosis of right knee septic arthritis and an acute kidney injury on top of his chronic kidney disease. Mr Nippard was on antibiotics and on 2nd   June 2022 underwent a washout of his knee. On 8th   June he had a second washout. By 17th   June he was deteriorating, on 20th   June his CRP was increasing. He said in his evidence that the pressure sore was first documented by the orthopaedic team on 21stJune, the surgeon described this now as – the bigger source of infection.  
 
An MRI was requested but did not take place for 4 days; it was undertaken on 25th June and reported as showing no obvious sacral osteomyelitis it did show that it had locally spread in the soft tissue.  
 
By 28th June Mr Nippard was getting worse, his inflammatory markers were going up and now his testicles were swollen, and there was a suspicion was that this was Fournier’s Gangrene and there was a referral made to the Urology team. 
   
The orthopaedic surgeon said that as far as the treatment for Mr Nippard’s knee went, he felt they were winning that it was improving that if he hadn’t developed the pressure sore his expectation was that he would have been discharged. He agreed with the medical cause of death proposed.  
 
A Consultant Urologist examined Mr Nippard on 28th June, he said that he had evidence of a significant infection, that the only treatment was surgery, and all agreed that surgery was not likely to help, and it would cause Mr Nippard immense suffering in his last days. He explained that the other medical conditions Mr Nippard suffered with caused him to be compromised, if he’d had a stronger heart and kidneys then they would have operated 
 
Sadly, after discussions with Urologists, Surgeons, Anesthetists and the Critical care team it was decided that Mr Nippard was not fit for surgery, and he was placed on priorities of care and died on 6th   July 2022. 
 
It was the view of the doctors who attended the inquest and gave evidence that the pressure sore significantly contributed to Mr Nippard’s death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

These difficulties included self harm and suicidal ideation, as a result of command auditory hallucinations.
 
On the 2nd of May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance with a mental health crisis and suicidal ideation, [REDACTED]. He was clear that what would help him would be “to not go home” and that he did not feel safe at home. He was discharged in the absence of any comprehensive assessment, and in the absence of liaison with his family. The clinician assessing him did not have all of the important information to be able to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment, including in relation to recent incidents of self harm.
 
The deceased was seen by his care co ordinator on the 3rd of May 2022. The de- ceased again confirmed that he had drunk bleach on the command of voices, and both he and family were asking for admission. There was no comprehensive assessment. Again the clinician was not aware of important information which should have been taken into account in any assessment of risk, including in relation to self harm.
 
On the 4th of May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance [REDACTED]. He told Doctors in the Emergency Department he had done this at the command of voices, that he still felt suicidal, and if discharged he would attempt to take his life again. There was no comprehensive assessment by mental health services and the clinician was not in possession of all relevant information as to risk. The deceased was discharged on the basis that there was no indication of current suicidal ideation at the point of the assessment or objective evidence of psychosis, to his home address, where he had indicated he did not feel safe. Whilst awaiting transport the deceased left the hospital having discarded his mobile phone and was reported missing. He was assessed as medium risk by the Police in the light of information provided by mental health services which had not been up- dated and did not include all risk events.
 
Having left the hospital, the deceased fell or jumped [REDACTED] on the 5th May 2023, despite the efforts of Police officers on the scene. Kenneth’s intention cannot be established although it is known that the deceased was suffering from a deterioration in his mental health in the days leading up to his death, including evidence of auditory command hallucinations to harm himself.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
The inquest heard evidence that to deal with the risk of falls in patients deemed to be high risk the concept of observable bay nursing had been introduced at both Trusts. At both Trusts Mrs Nickson fell whilst unobserved due to the challenges of maintaining the bays as observed bays. The challenge for both trusts had arisen where staff were required to deal with issues out of the bay and left the bay area.

In 2020, whilst being investigated by the colorectal service at Queens Hospital, a CT scan performed in November 2020 raised the possibility of a malignant process in the lung but this report was not seen by the clinical team. If it had been seen, it is likely that annual review and monitoring would have been arranged and this may have enabled the lung tumour which subsequently developed to have been diagnosed and treated before it reached stage 4. There was, therefore, a lost opportunity to monitor for and, possibly, to diagnose and treat, the lung cancer. However, it is possible that the tumour, which probably developed quickly, would not have been found even by annual review. Consequently, on the evidence, it is not possible to ascertain whether monitoring probably would, or would not, have prevented the Deceased’s death.","Background:
1.     The evidence at the inquest showed that the results of two separate scans performed on the Deceased, both of which had concerning outcomes, were not seen and acted upon in a timely manner.
 
2.     First, on the 8th October 2020, a Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at Queens Hospital requested a CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax, abdomen and pelvis because the Deceased had reported significant weight loss and other symptoms. The radiologist’s report on the scan, dated the 8th November 2020, mentioned findings of multiple lung nodules and included a differential diagnosis of lung metastases. This outcome was never seen by the requesting clinician, nor any other clinician (including the Deceased’s General Practitioner). I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy; I was told that “the reporter would not raise this as an incidental finding because malignancy was already queried and would expect the referring clinician to review results”. The Consultant Colorectal Surgeon told me, however, that his understanding of the system was that he would be alerted to any finding or suspicion of malignancy. Further, although the Deceased had subsequently been given three outpatients appointments, the error was not picked up through these because all three appointments were cancelled by the hospital and the Deceased was not seen by the colorectal team again.
 
3.     Secondly, a further CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax was undertaken on the 9th April 2022, but the formal report (suspicious for lung cancer) was not made until the 24th May 2022, and this resulting in delay in the Deceased being seen on the cancer pathway by the respiratory team. It seems that the delay in reporting was because a second hospital number had been used for the Deceased when the scan was performed in an external CT scanner located on the King George Hospital site.
 
4.     At the inquest, I heard oral evidence from [REDACTED] , and I received documentary evidence, explaining the changes which have been made since the Deceased’s death. The documentation received included an 11 point Action Plan, supported by evidence as to the action that has been taken. On the basis of that evidence, I am satisfied that most of the concerns relating to the Deceased’s scan reporting and other management have been addressed.
 
5.     I do, however, have two ongoing concerns about the system in place for the communication of concerning radiological findings. Steps have been taken to improve the system previously in place. In particular, I have been provided with a copy of the Trust’s new “Radiology Unsuspected Cancers and Critical Findings Protocol” which, I am told, has now been approved, and will be adopted, by the Radiology Clinical Leads and Clinical Governance Leads across North East London. I was also told that a new electronic scan requesting and reporting system will “go live” in August 2023, and that this will enable unexpected cancers and other incidental critical findings to be “red-flagged” directly to the requesting team. The system will also have an “acknowledgment option” enabling the referring doctor to click on a read receipt for all radiology reports.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows:
Concern 1:
The Trust’s new policy is concerned with ensuring that unexpected cancer or other critical radiological findings are highlighted to the requesting team. However, the evidence at the inquest suggested that requesting team were not alerted to the suspicious outcome of the Deceased’s November 2020 scan because it was an expected finding; as stated above, I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy and the outcome was not, therefore, treated as unexpected. I am concerned, therefore, that the same could happen again, despite the changes which have been made. I did not consider that [REDACTED] was able to address this concern satisfactorily in his evidence.
 
Concern 2:
The new electronic system is introducing a “read receipt” feature which, if used, would enable identification of reports which have not been opened and read by the requesting team in a timely manner. I am concerned, however, that the use of the read receipt is optional as this will inevitably undermine the extent to which any monitoring system will be able to spot and identify unread reports. I did not consider that either [REDACTED], nor the Consultant Colorectal Surgeon from whom I heard evidence about the plans for monitoring in the surgical department of Queens Hospital, were able to address this concern satisfactorily in their evidence.","I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter John Harris, aged 73 years, who died at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London on the 10th June 2022.

His mother was attended by paramedics, but really what she needed was early hospital obstetric care.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
That Phoenix’ death was and remains utterly devastating for his parents is unsurprising. However, it was clear at inquest that it was also deeply shocking for those trying to care for him and his mum. Events were outside the experience of several of the healthcare professionals involved.
 
I heard at inquest that new national maternity guidance is to be published at the end of the month. This will include within it revised advice for paramedics faced with an unplanned home delivery such as this one to transport to hospital even if birth is imminent. I was assured at inquest that the advice will quickly be disseminated.
 
Had I not been given this information, I would have made a prevention of future deaths report to the ambulance service.
 
It is of course of the utmost importance that hospital clinicians and ambulance clinicians have the same understanding of how a patient in any given situation should be treated, and I have copied this report to the London Ambulance Service (LAS).
 
The reason I make a report to the Homerton, is because it seemed to me at inquest that there were two matters that had not yet been resolved.
 
i)  At inquest, there was not a shared understanding among the clinicians within the trust about how such a situation should be approached.
 
The obstetricians were clear that, given her very high risk status, Phoenix’ mum needed to come in to hospital as soon as she showed the first signs of labour. And even if she had started to deliver, she could still only be treated effectively and Phoenix given the best chance of a good outcome in hospital.","On 3 August 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Phoenix Chapman, a baby who died less than six weeks after he was born. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 July 2023. I made a determination at inquest of death by natural causes.   ","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11 September 2023.

He underwent surgery on 18 October 2022 to remove the tumour. This was surgically uneventful. Post-operatively, he required a lengthy period of intensive care. On the 19 December 2022 he was stepped down from intensive care to a ward. He was at a very high risk of developing a thromboembolism due to his cancer diagnosis, recent surgery, lengthy period in hospital and immobility. During the period of 9 to 15 January 2023 he refused his anti- coagulation medication on three occasions. The reason for refusal is unclear and there is no documented evidence that the risk of non-compliance with the medication was explained to him or escalated to the medical team. On the 20 January 2023, Mr. James suffered from an acute deterioration in his health, culminating in a cardiac arrest. He passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on the 21 January 2023 from a pulmonary embolism. The missing doses of anticoagulation during the two weeks leading up to his death is likely to have contributed to a degree, to the development of the pulmonary embolism.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The refusal of anti-coagulation medication was not brought to the attention of medical staff. The administration of anti-coagulation medication to patients like Mr James, is vital for reducing the risk of a venous thrombo-embolism, a potentially life-threatening condition. There is no electronic prompt/alert to highlight to the medical team when prescribed anticoagulation medication is not administered.
 
The Trust’s internal investigator recognised that a fail-safe should be put in place within the electronic records, to ensure escalation to the medical team where doses of prescribed anti- coagulation are not administered. Such a measure could prevent similar deaths from occurring. It was considered that this measure could assist in preventing future deaths not just locally, but at a wider level.",On 16 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr John Michael James.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:
 
1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.
 
2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.
 
3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.
 
4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.
 
5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.
 
6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.
 
7.  Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.
 
8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.
 
9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.
 
10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.
 
The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.","On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021 [REDACTED].
 
The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.
 
I made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:
 
1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
 
2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.
 
3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.
 
4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.
 
5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.
 
6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.
 
7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.
 
8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.
 
9.  At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased’s home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4th August 2023.

At approximately 3pm on 11 June 2020, she was on s17 escorted leave, standing with a healthcare assistant (HCA) at the front gates of the hospital having a cigarette, when she turned to the HCA, said “I’m sorry I have to do this to you” and ran away.
 
ELFT contacted the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) at 3.17pm, but by 3.58pm, Ms Findlay had been found by a member of the public in a nearby park.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality.
 
That means more than simply a change in policy wording.","On 16 June 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Heather Findlay, aged 28 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today.

She had recently been diagnosed with hypertension which was being treated with atenolol. She was also taking hormone replacement therapy. 
ii.) For the previous 5 years she had been using a Decathlon Easybreath full face snorkel mask when on holiday. 
iii.) On the 13th January 2020 she was snorkelling using the full face mask when she expressed concerns and was accompanied back to the beach. She collapsed and died. 
iv.) Expert evidence at the inquest identified immersion pulmonary oedema as the cause of the death. This is caused by the build-up of fluid in the lungs as a result of an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure caused by water pressure when the chest is submerged. This is exacerbated by hypertension and hormone replacement therapy. Negative pressure in the lungs causes fluid from the blood vessels to be drawn into the lungs. 
v.) The use of a full face snorkel mask contributed to the death in two ways: 
a.) because negative pressure in the lungs is increased as a result of the increased effort of breathing caused by inhalation through the snorkel tube and mask, and 
b.) because respiratory effort is increased by the inhalation of elevated carbon dioxide levels caused by inhaling air drawn through a dead space in the mask.
Both exacerbate the negative pressure in the lungs and increase the effects of immersion pulmonary oedema.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Awareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession:
i.) Concerns were raised by the medical witnesses that there is very little awareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession and that it is not addressed in medical training, as a consequence, it can be missed by those treating the condition and is often mistaken for drowning.
 
The Full Face Mask
 
ii.) At the time that the Easybreath full face snorkel mask was developed by Decathlon there were no United Kingdom or European Standards which were applicable to a full face snorkelling mask.
iii.) In the course of its development, Decathlon commissioned a number of tests to be undertaken on it, but it was accepted in evidence that the tests undertaken did not replicate the conditions of the use of the mask by the general public.
iv.) Decathlon have sold over 16 million of the masks. Other such masks are also on the market.
v.) The Decathlon usage instructions for the full face mask, contained in small print, have been amended over time. From the 17th August 2015 the instructions included a warning that you must make sure that you are in good physical condition before snorkelling and that the mask is not suitable for swimming.
vi.) Further tests were undertaken and an Ergomedical report considered the issue of whether use of the mask and inhalation through the mask’s dead space gave rise to excess carbon dioxide inhalation. The report concluded “we strongly recommend to advise against wearing Easybreath masks to people who suffer from underlying cardio-respiratory conditions.”
vii.) As a result, Decathlon amended their instructions for use to include that the mask should not be used if the user has unstable cardio-respiratory pathologies, that the mask is to be used under conditions of submaximal exercise (mild to moderate) and that it is not suitable for active swimming.
viii.) Development of a United Kingdom standard in relation to this type of mask is now being put in train but has not yet begun and is likely to take some time.
ix.) Decathlon have recently updated their website in the United Kingdom to include the following, “It is not recommended to use this product if you have any ongoing respiratory or cardiovascular issues including but not limited to chest infection, asthma, high/raised blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease or angina etc. If you have any doubts or questions relating to this please check with your medical practitioner.” The same additional wording is being translated and added to all websites of the company.
x.) The packaging of the mask has been revised to show a pictogram to warn against use of the mask by those with heart or other cardiovascular conditions.
xi.) The concern is that many million of the full face masks have been sold and the safety concerns about their use by those with ongoing cardiovascular and respiratory issues has not been widely publicised or brought to the attention of those who already own the masks. Those purchased before 2017 had no warning is relation to these matters and the warning included in the instructions from 2017 inwards was not prominent nor sufficient to alert prospective purchasers to the hazards of use which have now been identified.",Following an investigation opened on the 2nd March 2020 and an inquest opened on the 5th March 2020 the inquest was concluded on the 20th December 2022.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9th May 2023.

Evidence was heard that a number of children who have ‘febrile’ seizures subsequently die from ‘sudden unexpected death in childhood’. Evidence was provided that there should be greater emphasis on medical education, research and public information for sudden unexpected deaths associated with febrile seizures. Further evidence was heard that referrals for assessment and investigation of febrile seizures should be undertaken earlier to exclude a more severe underlying illness.
 
2. Information provided to parents/guardians after their child had a Febrile Seizure 
Evidence was heard that the NHS website and pamphlet provided to parents/guardians following a child’s febrile seizure is insufficiently informative to provide parents with sufficiently detailed information to assist them in picking up potential early indicators of a more severe illness
e.g. issues with gait, co-ordination, definition of complex seizures, developmental regression etc.
 
3. Improvement to and highlighting of the JRCALC guidelines for paramedic management of seizures in children JRCALC guidelines indicated paramedics should have conveyed Louis to hospital or contacted the GP and/or Out of Hours GP service following Louis’s second seizure on 11th February 2020, as the close proximity of two seizures indicated it was a ‘complex febrile seizure’ rather than a febrile seizure. This led to a lost opportunity to expeditiously trigger further investigation and/or a referral to either the ‘first seizure’ service or to a specialist paediatrician for further assessment and management. Evidence was heard that improving and highlighting JRCALC guidelines with additional teaching would prevent this happening again.",On 8th February 2022 I recommenced an investigation into the death of Louis James Rogers.

It is thought that they were all on a sand bar when they were overtaken and cut off by the incoming tide. All five bodies were recovered to the shore that day, or found after the tide had receded. The RNLI had recommended deploying lifeguards at the beach in 2013 but Rother District Council had not implemented that recommendation. It was accepted quite quickly after these deaths and lifeguards are now deployed. There was considerable evidence at the inquest on the question of whether that step, and others recommended, would have prevented any of the deaths. It should be noted that the length of the beach from which people can swim is about three miles and the distance between high water mark and low water mark is as much as a kilometre in some tides.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Mr Parsons had spent the evening of Friday 22 April 2022 at the Porthleven Food Festival. He had been due to meet up with his wife at a rented holiday cottage in Porthleven on the morning of Saturday 23 April 2022. He failed to meet her as planned and was uncontactable.
 
The police search revealed that Mr Parsons was last seen just before midnight on 22 April 2022 by a witness in the in the big tent at the harbour. The witness stated that Mr Parsons did not seem to be drunk at the time that they were speaking.
 
On 4 May 2022 the fully clothed body of Mr Parsons was recovered from the sea, approximately 4 miles off the coast of the Isles of Scilly after being spotted by a fisherman.
 
The post-mortem revealed no injuries and gave the cause of death identified above. Toxicology shows raised urine ethanol (alcohol) at 291 mg / 100 ML. For comparison, the legal driving limit alcohol in urine is 107 mg / 100 ML urine.
 
The Inquest findings were as follows
·       Mr Parsons died after midnight, on 23 April 2023 after falling into the harbour waters and drowning.
·       Due to Mr Parsons body being located fully clothed, he fell into the water by accident and not through choice.
That if Mr Parsons was still conscious and was able to shout for help, he is unlikely to have been heard by anyone due to the noise of the ongoing events.
·       The alcohol consumed by Mr Parsons made it more likely that when entering the water this would increase the risk of drowning due to impairment of cognition and motor skills.
·       Police evidence revealed that the sea off Porthleven features a notorious current that means it is not safe to swim in the harbour.
·       The pier and harbour walls raised safety issues discussed below under matters of concern. The police evidence was that these safety issues amounted to a failing to ensure the safety of members of the public.
Responsibility for public safety rests with the Porthleven Harbour & Dock Company as the owners of the harbour, and with Cornwall Council as the licensing authority for the Food Festival.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1 Response requested from Secretary of State for Education and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
Lance was only exposed to his killer because he was obliged to live in the designated accommodation. Although the 2 relevant Councils were duty bound to house both individuals up until the age of 21 under the Leaving Care Act, there is currently no regulation for the over 18’s. Regulation is being introduced for 16- 17 year olds in April 2023.
 
Both Councils were in agreement that Regulation of this sector would be welcomed to support them in carrying out their statutory obligations . A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC’s regulation as the provision is not for “care” but support. The provision is made from an entirely un-regulated sector, resulting in some organisations offering accommodation with inadequate training, staffing or knowledge to meet the complex needs of some of our most vulnerable individuals. Consideration should be given to introducing regulation for at least 18-21 year old individuals. This issue remains a concern for all those who work within it.","On 17 July 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lance Scott Walker, age 18 .

She was then taken to Wythenshawe Hospital. There was a delay in triage due to demands on the Emergency Department. Triage did not pick up on her being a potential silver trauma case. A CT scan was not ordered at that time. She was triaged to be seen within 1 hour. ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
1.     Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;
 
2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;
 
3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;
 
4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival.",On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson. The investigation concluded on the 12th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from injuries sustained in a road traffic collision where there was a delay in identifying the severity of the injuries sustained. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7th April 2022.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. (HEALTHCARE) Lack of safe system, supported by training, guidance, and compliance auditing, for the provision of physical healthcare assessment and monitoring by NEWS2 for acutely unwell patients in a secure setting.
 
The Jury found shortcomings in the healthcare afforded to Alex at HMP Nottingham in the form of “continuous failures to provide adequate healthcare, which probably more than minimally contributed to his death“.
 
I heard evidence that staff were not consistently assessing acutely unwell patients using the NEWS2 system, despite the scoring system having been adopted across the NHS over the past decade and having been adopted by this Trust many years prior.
 
In 2017, when relaunching the NEWS system, the Royal College of Physicians noted,
“Every so often, someone comes up with an idea that is so obvious, no one can understand why it wasn’t thought of before. I am proud that the RCP’s National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is one of those initiatives – not just a chart (or iPad) at the end of the bed to record the patient’s physical signs and symptoms, but the chart at the end of the bed – a single point of truth to unify recording of symptoms across the NHS, consolidate training for doctors and nurses in the recording of symptoms, and thereby improve patient safety. When the RCP launched the NEWS in 2012, we hoped to see the score adopted across the NHS. What has been more astonishing is the adoption of the score internationally, with requests to use NEWS coming from health services across the world from Europe to India and the USA, including the US Naval Air Forces!“
 
I heard evidence of an inconsistent application of NEWS2 by staff, an inconsistent awareness of NEWS2 across the staff body, and an absence of clear and robust training supported by guidance, ensuring staff were aware of the expectations of their employer with regards to the use of NEWS2 in monitoring acutely unwell patients.
 
Sadly, Alex’s is not an isolated case. I have been repeatedly assured at a senior level from Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that they are seeking to embed NEWS2 across their Directorates, yet successive inquests have heard of patients failed by the lack of use of the system by the clinical staff responsible for their medical care. If this issue is not addressed across the Trust, with sufficient urgency, patients will continue to die in Trust settings due to a failure to recognise the
deteriorating patient, and to arrange for timely healthcare intervention.","On 06 April 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Alexander Michael BRAUND, aged 25.  The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, conducted before a Jury, on 30 November 2022.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 14, 2023.
