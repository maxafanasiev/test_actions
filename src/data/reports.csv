The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
a.[REDACTED] evidence is that on several occasions during Ms. Woodman’s inpatient admission to Spenser Ward he was in communication with her and [REDACTED] of which treating clinicians were aware. On at least one of those occasions
 
[REDACTED]  spoke with Spenser Ward staff. I noted that Ms.Woodman had not [REDACTED] given consent for staff to contact [REDACTED] concerning her treatment. Notwithstanding this, I found that there were missed opportunities to gather important collateral history from [REDACTED]; Ms. Woodman’s partner and who knew her well in the lead up to her admission.
 
It would seem that staff speaking with [REDACTED]  on these occasions failed to think laterally or innovatively as to how to collect important, relevant collateral history whilst still respecting Ms. Woodman’s wish that her condition not be discussed with                                       .
 
The ability of mental health clinicians to gain a complete picture of Ms. Woodman’s medical history was hampered by the fact that the information management systems holding these records at her GP practice was not accessible to secondary mental health services. This resulted in gaps in information available to mental health clinicians which was not necessarily filled by measures taken by secondary mental health services to gather collateral information from the family and Ms. Woodman herself.",On 8th July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Ann WOODMAN. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th October 2022.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
It became evidence during the inquest that CMHT/ Crisis teams do not have contact details of:
Psychiatric liaison nurse services in neighbouring (out of their locality) boroughs based in Accident & Emergency departments, or details of
CMHT/ crisis teams in neighbouring boroughs.
 
Such contact could provide for direct referral, contact and passing on of knowledge of cases between neighbouring organisations, especially when individuals have already been assessed and asked to attend for a face-to-face consultation. Otherwise, those individuals who seek help, may have to revisit the same process of being interviewed on multiple occasions with a sense of déjà vu and anxiety that they are not obtaining the urgent assistance and support that they require. That may lead to them not engaging when they had hitherto made every attempt to do so.
 
To provide those contact details would seem a relatively simple task, so teams could contact each other, and the local psychiatric liaison nurses based within the A&Es.","On 27 November 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Oliver Beswetherick, aged 24 years.

On the 2nd January 2023 he was cycling his bicycle with a friend, a common activity for Mr Colledge. He was riding along Island Lane, Winmarleigh when his bicycle entered a crack defect in the carriageway causing him to be thrown from his bicycle and sustain injuries which caused his death. The crack defect in question had been seen by local residents and members of the local Parish Council on the 9th September 2022. They took photographs of the defect and others on the road, and reported them to the Highways department at the Lancashire County Council. The senior manager who received the photographs tasked others to inspect the road and repair the defects. Four Highways operatives attended the road in two vehicles on the 15th of September 2022. The road was driven in its entirety and no defects were noticed or repaired. A second, scheduled inspection took place by Highways inspectors on the 26th of September 2022. This also involved two operatives conducting a driven inspection and neither observed the crack defect which caused Mr Colledge’s collision. Consequently the crack was not repaired and remained hazardous in the roadway at the time of Mr Colledge’s incident and death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Highway operatives gave evidence that their inspections primarily consider the impact of defects upon cars using that road surface. All gave evidence of no specific training or experience with regards to identifying defects which present a hazard to bicycle users, when expert evidence indicated that the Council’s statutory duty required reasonable steps to protect all road users which includes cyclists. The evidence of Council witnesses was unanimous that since Mr Colledge’s death, there has been no additional training, updates, briefings or policy reviews to offer further knowledge of operatives in safely assessing defects which pose risks to cyclists or road users other than car drivers. I consider there is a risk of future deaths of all cyclists if Highways Operatives and inspectors are not able to identify defects on a carriageway which present a risk to cyclists as opposed to simply car users.
 
Evidence from a Highways Expert, [REDACTED] , explained that Island Lane is part of peat/moss road which is the subject of natural movement when it rains. The water is absorbed by the peat/moss and swells caused the tarmac to move then it compacts when it dries and the road surface lowers, causing cracks.[REDACTED]’ evidence was that there is natural movement but
these defects rarely get better, only worse. I am concerned that the road surfacing on Island Lane, Winmarleigh will continue to be the subject of natural movement and the present surfacing is hampered by the geography of the location including camber of the road. I consider there is a risk of future deaths to road users if the surfacing of this road is not adequately maintained. Whilst the inspection schedule timescales enacted by the Council are considered to be appropriate, I consider there is a risk of future deaths due to the present surfacing and underlying geological features of this road if inspections are unable to reasonably identify hazardous defects.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 12th January 2024.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTER THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT is the method of prescribing medications such as Zopiclone [REDACTED] etc. to patients with a history which suggests that they either are or are very likely to be becoming dependent upon such medications or are misusing them.
Examples of both the above would be too frequent requests for repeat prescriptions and information concerning and a history of overdoses.
 
The Inquest discussed whether circumstances, including those outlined above should trigger an automatic/mandatory medication review conducted  with the patient; consideration of a different prescribing period and very careful monitoring of the online requests for repeat prescriptions.
Alternatively, there could be a ban on the requests for repeat prescriptions with the repeats simply being issued for an appropriate period of time “automatically”.
 
In this case as you will see from [REDACTED] report, over twice the appropriate amount of Zopiclone was issued over a period of 57 days.
 
The patient in question had Zopiclone present at a fatal level in his blood at the time of his collapse from which he never recovered.
 
I remain very worried about these prescribing issues and about the fact that apparently receptionists and clinicians can override the warnings in the surgery’s computer system. I should like this to be carefully investigated and look forward to hearing with a response within the relevant time period.
 
I realise that the situation may be exacerbated by GPs working part time and many part time practitioners being involved in the prescribing procedure as well as many receptionists being involved in it but if this is the trend then it seems to me the safeguards must be extended not made easier to override.
 
The other ‘failsafe device’ is the dispensing pharmacist.
When repeats are requested online there is a designated pharmacy. They receive emailed scripts. Their own systems should flag up cases of over or too frequent prescribing as well as other matters.",On 18 th April 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Darren James CARRINGTON The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6th June 2018.,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you AND your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 4th 2018.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
That in respect of GMP Call Handler’s being required to call an ambulance to attend the scene, even where it is reported that someone is “dead” there has been no institutional learning following this incident. I asked [REDACTED] if there had been any learning, reflection or training since this incident. He said that there hadn’t on this issue.
 
That the training delivered to the first two attending officers did not adequately prepare them for responding to a scene where someone is found hanging in a way which is consistent with their priority to preserve life of a hanging casualty.
 
I heard evidence from Detective Superintendent [REDACTED] that both attending officers were part of a cohort of at least 650 officers within GMP (and a larger cohort nationally) who received their initial police training entirely online. I am concerned that both officers’ training on Sudden Death (and the training of others) was delivered as one of over 15 online modules on a given day and that at the time of the inquest, they had not received any classroom based or on the job training. I am concerned that they are not the only officers within GMP who have received this level/method of training input and therefore there is a risk that other officers on duty have inadequate training on this issue.
 
4. There was evidence given to me by Detective Superintendent [REDACTED] that there is an unknown number of GMP officers who are not meeting the expectation of receiving First Aid refresher training within 12 months, which since May 2022 has included training on how to resuscitate a hanging casualty. I am therefore concerned that there remains a cohort of officers who have not had the post May 2022 training that includes how to provide Basic Life Support to this kind of casualty until the arrival of an ambulance.","On the 25th October 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samuel Curless (Sam).

His discharge conditions included that he should notify the authorities of any developing relationships. He failed to notify the authorities that he had begun a relationship with Sobhia, and after the relationship had been ongoing for around a year he persuaded her to move from Bradford to Derby. Within little more than 5 weeks of her doing so he brutally murdered her. He ran a defence of diminished responsibility but was convicted of her murder. At the time of the murder [REDACTED] was being supervised by numerous agencies: the police, social services, the community mental health team, MAPPA, and the Ministry of Justice. That he was nonetheless able to form a relationship with Sobhia in secret, and to murder her, was surprising and concerning. This formed the focus on my inquest.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Scrutiny of s.41 MHA 1983 cases by the Mental Health Tribunal. In this case [REDACTED] was discharged by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) following the receipt of reports from Cygnet Hospital which were inadequate and misrepresented the progress he had made and the risk that he posed. Nonetheless there were indicators which should have led the MoJ to question whether this case should have been referred to a Mental Health Tribunal, such as [REDACTED] minimising his culpability for his previous offending. The offences against his former wife were of the utmost gravity, particularly in the context of his behaviour during the marriage that she later disclosed. This indicated a risk of such a level as to make it not only desirable but essential that discharge was not contemplated until there had been close and careful scrutiny by those with expertise in forensic risk assessment. The MoJ Guidance on restricted patients says that “the vast majority” of discharge decisions are made by the Tribunal. In a patient with risk profile it is difficult to envisage circumstances whereby that should have been displaced.
 
Ensuring that s.41 restricted patients are supervised under a forensic pathway. In this case no such pathway even existed in the locality. This meant that Mustafa’s supervision was inadequate having regard to the risk that he posed. Such orders are imposed to protect the public from the risk of serious harm. Even where it has been adjudged that any previous offending would not have happened but for a mental disorder, there is still the need for a forensic approach. The risk component must not be overlooked as it was here. Forensic pathways must be available across the country.
 
Police power to arrest where there is a reason to believe a person is at risk of death/serious injury. Whilst I was critical of the failure of the police to take measures that were reasonably available to them to investigate the intelligence that had been received that [REDACTED] was in a relationship, the one power that was not available to them was to arrest him. This leaves a significant gap in the powers that are available to the police to protect individuals who are at risk of death/serious injury. Although I cannot say whether the threshold would have been met in Sobhia’s case, such a power could in future cases ensure that it is understood that where an individual poses a significant risk of causing serious harm in relationships, and there is evidence that he is concealing a relationship, he can be arrested.
 
Ministry of Justice power to recall where a patient poses a significant risk to the public. The MoJ will not generally recall dangerous individuals unless there is a decline in their mental health presentation notwithstanding the fact that s.41 MHA 1983, to which [REDACTED] was subject, is designed to protect the public from serious harm. Whilst there is the possibility of the judge imposing a hybrid order, and that was not considered appropriate in this case, it did not mean that [REDACTED] risk only existed in the context of a decline in his mental health. If an individual subject to a s.41 restriction order poses a significant risk to the public then the public can only be protected if he can be recalled to hospital where further assessment can be undertaken. If it then transpires that, as likely was the case here, the mental health component had previously been exaggerated, this would at the very least allow for a discharge plan to then be prepared which takes account of this and ensures that there is adequate focus on managing the risk. One way of achieving this would be a power to arrest being attached to the patient’s discharge conditions, enforceable where there is a significant risk of serious harm.
 
Travel overseas for s.41  restricted patients. [REDACTED]was permitted to travel to and from Pakistan freely and to return seemingly as and when he saw fit. Whilst he was outside the jurisdiction there was no way of checking on him, including in terms of his mental health, but also his risk. There were concerns, for example, that he may have been arranging a forced marriage for his niece. He could have entered into a relationship, for all the authorities knew. It also allowed him an opportunity to push and test the boundaries. He was permitted to travel out of the jurisdiction as he pleased, sometimes returning late, sometimes early. By contrast, had he been on licence after serving a custodial sentence, he would in all probability have been prevented from travelling outside the jurisdiction, at least in the early stages. Whilst I acknowledge that there are qualitative differences between a prison sentence and a hospital order, it remains legitimate if not necessary to ensure that those who have recently discharged from a s.41 order are carefully monitored, in the jurisdiction, at least for the first 12 months. This is beneficial not only in terms of monitoring mental health, but also risk.
 
Clinicians should be provided with full reports when considering discharge. This was a particular concern in relation to the fact that those recommending discharge were not provided with the full Spousal Assault Risk Assessment, but only a summary. Given [REDACTED] risk profile, and the catastrophic consequences that were liable to result from him being pre-emptively discharged, and that discharge was being recommended without recourse to the Tribunal, it was essential that the s.117 meeting was informed by detailed reports which, had they been properly considered, would have indicated a need for circumspection.
 
Over-reliance on self-reporting. This was a theme that ran throughout the inquest and the various agencies involved. This was a case that required a forensic approach throughout, both in hospital and in the community. It was recognised that [REDACTED] was narcissistic and manipulative but he was nonetheless relied upon to provide updates as to his mental health, his travel plans and the reasons for them, and – critically – whether or  not  he [REDACTED]  was  in a relationship. [REDACTED] risk arose primarily in the context of relationships and he was not somebody that could be relied upon to disclose them. On the contrary, he had shown himself willing and adept at concealing them. This underlined why his self-reporting could not be relied upon and this was something that should have featured in his management throughout, and flagged at the point of discharge.
 
Record-keeping. This was a thread that ran through the case and applied both to the clinical notes but also the notes of meetings, such as MAPPA, which are necessarily a summary but which did not always include sufficient information to enable those reviewing them to understand what had been discussed and what actions taken. In terms of clinical records, whilst basic, mundane matters such as his sleeping habits and appetite were recorded, much of what mattered was not. The paucity of records and the  poverty of their quality  meant that [REDACTED] was not aware of the history of manipulation and the other factors which indicated an ample need for reassessment. In terms of the SOTP, whereas there was a conflict of evidence as to why the group programme was not available at Cygnet hospital, the keeping of proper records would have ensured that there was a ready answer if needed. The discharge meetings were poorly recorded, with the spousal assault risk assessment not having featured at all. There were repeated instances of witnesses not being able to remember, understandably, what had happened with respect to certain events. There was no excuse for professional witnesses to be put in this embarrassing position. The MoJ are reliant on what they are told in writing, but given that there is a culture of poor record- keeping, until and unless that record-keeping is improved to an acceptable level, they have to be more pro-active and more prepared to question things.
 
i. Familiarisation of professionals with cultural issues. In this case there appears  to have been a reluctance to make enquiries with the Mosque and the Islamic Meat Centre, and to be aware of how the family dynamics are impacted by cultural issues. Although it was intended that a family tree would be completed, and this should have been done pre-discharge, [REDACTED] was able to some extent to throw a curtain around his family and thereby prevent those working with him from understanding the lengths they were prepared to go to protect him. It was noted that him becoming the Head of the family after his father’s death was significant, but the wider consequences were not properly considered.","On 28 May 2017 an investigation was commenced into the death of Sobhia Tabasim Khan, aged 37.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 February 2024.   The conclusion of the inquest was unlawful killing.

She had no active symptoms of these conditions until 2021 and until November 2022 her symptoms had been managed in primary care services with medication.
 
Naz’s referral into secondary mental health services in November 2022 followed notification by the DWP that she would have her universal credit reviewed, by the Performance Review Team.
 
Naz’s mental health deteriorated necessitating a period of informal admission to the Bradgate Unit on the 5th December 2022 and she was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder, an excessive reaction to stress that involves negative thoughts, strong emotions and changes in a person’s behaviour. I heard evidence from a Consultant Psychiatrist that the trigger stressor for this was the DWP performance review, suggested overpayment and potential debt.
 
It took 6 months for the DWP review to be completed. During which time there:
were at least 6 missed opportunities to use an additional support tab on Naz’s DWP profile to record the details of her vulnerability and alert other DWP personnel.
was a failure to pass vital information between the performance review team and universal credit case handling team of the need to correspond with Naz’s daughter, because corresponding with Naz was of serous detriment to her mental health.
 
Naz’s mental health was managed throughout this time by the secondary heath teams, and for the majority by the Crisis Resolution & Home Treatment team. The Crisis team were responsive throughout this time to Naz’s fluctuating symptoms and needs.
 
In the 4 weeks prior to the paracetomol overdose, despite a request for all correspondence to be directed through her daughter, Naz received 6 communications from the DWP, 2 telephone calls requiring detailed information of Naz, a journal log she didn’t understand and 3 separate letters which had a cumulative increase of the amount Naz owed of 75%.
 
6 days after receiving the last piece of correspondence from the DWP Naz took an overdose [REDACTED]. Those mental health professionals who had worked with Naz throughout 7 months in which her mental health had deteriorated gave evidence to me that the recurrent and predominant cause of Naz’s increased anxiety was the DWP performance review.

There is an ambiguity which could not be properly explored at the inquest, largely due to the passage of time.
 
However, this suggests that officers may have thought about ABD but did not mention it to others, which would be contrary to the “Speak Up and Speak Out” principle.

The evidence heard at the inquest was that a ‘warm drink’ would be comprised of ‘aired water’ topped by cold water and that a member of staff would check the temperature of the cup/beaker by way of applying their wrist to the same.
 
Blanche was not assisted with the beaker and it spilled causing her to suffer burns which upon assessment by a General Practitioner led to admission to hospital in the early hours of 16th July 2023. It was wholly apparent from the injuries that Blanche suffered that the temperature of the drink had not been checked in an adequate manner.

He developed epilepsy from the age of 6 years and had a diagnosis of Lennox-Gestaut syndrome for which he was under the care of the Department of Neurology at Royal Stoke University Hospital. In 2019 the Department of Neurology commenced Mr Burgess on 2.5ml twice daily Brivaracetam to control his seizure activity. The dosage was increased to 10ml twice a day in 2020 and responsibility for prescribing the medication was transferred to Mr. Burgess’ General Practitioner at the Brook Medical Centre, Bradeley, Stoke-On- Trent. The reason for the change in prescriber was for the sake of convenience as the GP were the prescriber for other medications.   Although the Brook Medical Centre were responsible for prescribing Brivaracetam there were no consultations between the surgery and Mr. Burgess or his mother regarding the management of his seizures or a review of medication, these continued to be undertaken by the Department of Neurology at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.   In July 2020 the Consultant Neurologist agreed with Mr. Burgess’ mother that the dosage of Brivaracetam should be reduced by 2ml every 2 weeks and to be reviewed in 4 months. A letter was sent from the Department of Neurology at Royal Stoke University Hospital to the Brook Medical Centre advising of this planned reduction. No amendment to the prescription was requested and no changes were made following the letter. The remained as Brivaracetam 10ml twice daily.
 
In November 2020 a letter was sent from the Department of Neurology at Royal Stoke University Hospital to the Brook Medical Centre advising that the dose of Brivaracetam had been reduced to 3ml twice daily but then back up to 5ml twice daily. No amendment to the prescription was requested and no changes were made following the letter.
 
In January 2021 a letter was sent from the Department of Neurology to the Brook Medical Centre advising that the dose of Brivaracetam was at 4ml twice daily and the deceased’s seizures were “relatively stable”. No amendment to the prescription was requested and no changes were made following the letter. The prescription remained as Brivaracetam 10ml twice daily.
 
On 22 July 2022 Mr. Burgess was moved out of his parent’s care by Stoke-on-Trent social services into a supportive living placement in Leicestershire run by Godfey Care. This was undertaken on an emergency basis. When Mr. Burgess arrived at the placement it was reported by staff that the medication bottles were unlabeled and so could not be given to Mr Burgess until confirmation of the prescription was received in writing by the prescriber. The evidence at inquest was that this was a Care Quality Commission requirement.
 
The deceased did not receive any Brivaracetam between 22 July 2022 and 26 July 2022.
 
On 25 July 2022 a “Best Interests Meeting” was undertaken involving Mr Burgess’ mother, Godfrey care and social services during which the Mr Burgess’ mother advised that the correct dosage of Brivaracetam was 4ml twice daily and not 10ml twice daily. The same information was provided by the Department of Neurology to Godfrey Care however the medication was not provided as the information regarding the correct dose had not been provided by the prescriber.
 
On 26 July 2022 the deceased was given Brivaracetam 10ml twice daily. The evidence at inquest was that this was likely due to a manager from Godfrey Care being given the prescription details during a call to the 111 service.
 
On 27 July 2022 a letter was sent from the Department of Neurology to the Brook Medical Centre explaining that Mr Burgess had been moved to a care organisation on an urgent basis and there was confusion over what medication he should be taking. A request was made to forward a list of his medication but also included information from his last review within the Department of Neurology that Brivaracetam at 4ml twice daily was the appropriate dose.
 
On 28 July 2022 the Brook Medical Centre sent a list of prescribed medication to Godfrey Care. As there had been no changes to prescription since July 2020 the recorded prescribed dose of Brivaracetam was 10ml twice daily although the dose that he has been given during the preceding 2 years was 4ml twice daily.
 
Mr Burgess continued to receive Brivaracetam at dose of 10ml twice daily until 5 September 2022 when he was seen in a clinic at Department of Neurology at Leicester Glenfield Hospital and established that there had been a sudden increase in the Brivaracetam dose from 4ml twice daily to 10ml twice daily. The plan was for the medication to be reduced to 9ml twice daily and then to continue to reduce by 1ml twice daily at weekly intervals until he was back to the “well tolerated” dose of 4ml twice daily.
 
Prior to 22 July 2022 whilst being given Brivaracetam at 4ml twice daily Mr Burgess experienced 5-6 seizures per week. Following the cessation of medication between 22-26 July 2022 and the increase in Brivaracetam to 10ml twice daily he was experiencing about 5 seizures per day and of longer duration.
 
The medication was reduced as per the instruction from Department of Neurology at Leicester Glenfield Hospital. On 23 September 2022 Mr Burgess was taken back into care of his mother. Although there had been a hospital attendance on the on 15 November 2022 the seizures had stablised to a similar frequency as before the sudden interruption and increase in medication.
 
On 19 November 2022 Mr. Burgess was sadly found unresponsive at his home address with death being verified by attending paramedic. He had passed away after vomiting and aspirating during an epileptic seizure.","Although not causative in Mr. Burgess death during the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The Neurology department of the Royal Stoke University Hospital operated a system whereby it did not instruct the prescribing GP to amend the prescription of Brivaracetam when changes to dosage had been agreed with Mr Burgess’ mother.  The evidence from the Consultant Neurologist was that an assumption was made that when changes to medication had been discussed and agreed that Mr Burgess’ mother would attend the GP surgery to discuss the changes in medication. The same witness gave evidence that it was assumed a pharmacist within the GP surgery would read the correspondence from the neurology department and make the necessary changes to prescriptions without express instructions to do so.
 
The “workflow” within the Brook Medical Centre was such that letters sent from the Neurology department discussing changes in medication (albeit not containing a request to amend the prescription) were processed by support staff and not referred to a clinician to consider and so no changes were made to the prescription.
 
The letter of 27 July 2022 from the Neurology department to Brook Medical Centre seeking clarification as to the correct dosage of Brivaracetam was processed by support staff and a summary medications sent without referral to a clinician.
 
Godfrey Care were informed by Mr Burgess’ mother and the Neurology department of Royal Stoke University that the appropriate dose of Brivaracetam was 4ml twice daily. Medication was withheld between 22-26 July 2022 due to the information not being in writing from the prescriber, however the evidence at inquest was that 10ml twice daily was

She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary and she was seen in A&E, the Acute Medical Unit, Frailty Assessment Unit for assessment but was deemed too poorly for that ward and was transferred to Ward 90.She had sustained rib fractures which had caused a pneumothorax and she had other co morbidities which were treated on Ward 90. The rib fractures caused an infection to develop in her lungs and Mrs Reed developed pneumonia. Whilst on ward 90 she began physiotherapy and was mobilising and able to eat and drink with minimal support. She was assessed as medically fit for discharge on 3rd February 2023, but she required more physiotherapy and support and so was transferred to a new no criteria to reside ward, Ward H130E in Hull Royal Infirmary. Whilst on Ward H130E Mrs Reed contracted Covid-19. (positive PCR 19/02/23, negative 23/02/23) and this set her discharge back as she had been planned for discharge to a residential rehab setting on 19/02/23. Mrs Reed was seen by the medical team on 24/02/23 as nursing staff had concerns. Mrs Reed was visibly dehydrated, drowsy, tachycardic and her blood tests showed signs of infection. She was assessed as now not medically fit for discharge however instead of being transferred on to a medical ward she was discharged on 26th February 29023 to Holy Name Community Rehab Centre in Hull. She was not medically fit for discharge and indeed should not have been discharged. The fact that she was very poorly was recognised as such upon arrival at the centre. The centre staff requested an urgent medical review and Mrs
Reed was placed on end of life care and very sadly died on 2nd March 2023 in the centre.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
H130 is on the 13th floor of Hull Royal Infirmary. It has an East and a West wing and spans the full floor. It was opened in response to winter pressures. At that time, in January 2023, Hull Royal Infirmary was placed under significant pressure in terms of admissions and staffing. The ward been open only a matter of some two weeks by the time Mrs Reed was transferred to that ward. Despite being medically fit for discharge upon arrival on that ward Mrs Reed’s condition worsened and family raised concerns as best they could but they reported that the ward was chaotic and that staff would tell them they had only just found out they were working on the ward before their shift started and there was no consistency of nursing staff on the ward.
 
Mrs Reed was dehydrated and family report that there was a paucity of personal care afforded on that ward. There was a risk of cross infection as patients’ personal effects such as toiletries were not with the right patients and had to be located by family. There was no established cohort of permanent staff on the ward at that time and no signposting to the ward sister or matron and therefore no way of patents, their friends, or their families being able to have a clear escalation pathway to ventilate concerns. Although HUTH now have an established team and leadership chain on Ward H130 there is a real concern that wards opened in response to winter pressures in the future in any busy hospital may give rise to the same peripatetic staffing regime, that is to say, agency staff and no fixed team in place and a lack of visible leadership. This could lead to the deterioration of patients not being recognised if there is no continuity of care by the same team of nursing staff.","On 7th March 2023, an inquest was opened and adjourned into the death of Ethel Doreen Reed aged 93 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on January 26th, 2024, The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental Death.   Box 3 of the Record of Inquest read:   Ethel Doreen Reed died at Holy Name Community Rehabilitation Centre, Hall Road, Hull from a chest infection which developed from fractured ribs following an unwitnessed fall at home.   Her medical cause of death was recorded as:   1a Chest infection 1b  Rib fractures 1c II    Fall, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Hypertension, Transient Ischaemic Attack, Ischaemic Heart Disease, Atrial Fibrillation",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8th April 2024.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
During the inquest I heard from the carers who worked with Mr Godderidge. They reported to me that when concerns are raised about a service-user’s capacity there is not reliable and routine liaison between Adult Social Care and the care providers. I am concerned that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. Care workers are very likely to see  a service user more often than others. They have a particularly valuable perspective as to a person’s capacity. If their observations are not being considered then opportunities to provide care to vulnerable people may well be missed.
Mr Godderidge’s carers also reported to me that in their experience consideration of capacity by Adult Social Care does not always reflect the possibility that a person’s capacity may be variable and fluctuating. I am concerned that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths if a person is considered on a ‘good day’ without understanding that their presentation fluctuates substantially over time.","On 3 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the  death  of  Thomas  GODDERIDGE.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
In February 2022, Kazarie was taken to hospital suspected of having swallowed a plastic foreign object. He then underwent an x-ray and a fluoroscopy, each with a negative result.
 
It was suggested to me in evidence that children suspected of having swallowed a non radio opaque object such as a googly eye, whose symptoms (unlike Kazarie’s) persist, should undergo an endoscopy even if they have had a negative x-ray and fluoroscopy.
 
I was told that there is a lack of national guidance for such a situation.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Mr Bates had a prescription for methadone issued by Recovery Steps. He was required to collect a dose each day from a named pharmacy. On 14th July 2023 Mr Bates stopped collecting methadone. The pharmacy explained that they sought to inform Recovery Steps of this development shortly after 14th but did not have any contact details other than a general number which is not always answered and a direct line for one key worker. They attempted to raise their concerns with that key worker, but the message appears not to have been relayed. Recovery Steps did not become aware that Mr Bate was not collecting methadone until 30th August 2023.
 
In answer to question from the Court, the pharmacy have also indicated that although it is there practice to inform Recovery Steps of any other concerns they might have about a person prescribed with methadone, this is a voluntary decision on their part and not a matter that arises from any obligation.
 
I am concerned that this situation gives rise to a risk of future death. It appears that there is no direct means by which a pharmacy can report to Recovery Steps that a service user has stopped collecting methadone. There is also no apparent obligation on pharmacies to report wider concerns for service users’ welfare to Recovery Steps. In each case this may mean that Recovery Steps are unaware that vulnerable service users require additional support.","On 8 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dayle BATES.

Since O’Shea’s death London Ambulance Service has added “JRCALC Plus” guidance stating where delivery is not progressing the patient should be conveyed to a hospital with obstetric support.,"The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1. Consideration to be given for the national JRCALC guidance to include the London Ambulance Service’s JRCALC Plus recommendation that where delivery is not progressing the patient should be conveyed to an obstetrics unit;","On the 27th May 2022 I opened an investigation touching the death of O’Shea Medad Dover who was 1 month old when he died. I opened an inquest on the 26th of September 2022, the inquest concluded on the 1st of February 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was the following narrative.
Laura was 30 weeks pregnant when she experienced abdominal pain and called emergency services. The call was wrongly categorised so paramedics arrived 44 minutes later than should have been the case. Midwifery advice was for the paramedics to bring Laura to hospital because pre-term deliveries require full obstetric and neonatal support. They did not follow this advice for three reasons…
 
They thought Laura was soon to deliver – a conclusion they’d be less likely to have reached had the call been correctly categorised and they’d been with her 44 minutes earlier;
Extrication from the property was challenging.
LAS guidance told them not to extricate if delivery is thought to be imminent.
 
Recognising the seriousness of the situation two midwifes came to Laura. They deemed her presentation to be more in keeping with placental abruption than imminent delivery and assisted paramedics in extrication Laura and taking her to hospital at 22.30. At 22.44, there was no foetal heart rate. At 23.04 O’Shea was delivered, resuscitation was started and caused a return of spontaneous circulation at
23.12. Given these things, it is likely O’Shea was subjected to acute severe hypoxia between 22.14 and 22.19. If the call to emergency services had been correctly categorised, Laura would have probably been in hospital by 20.57, Hme enough for CTG monitoring to recognise foetal distress prior to the hypoxia at 22.14 which would have prompted emergency caesarian. Had this happened it’s likely O’Shea would have survived.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Thursday the Twenty-Fifth of April 2024 I, the assistant coroner, may extend the period.

A Mental Health Act assessment carried out at the Magistrates Court on 24 September 2019 decided that he should be detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. However, as there were no hospital beds available at the time that Mr Popalzai’s case was heard, he was remanded in custody to HMP Pentonville. Mr Popalzai was transferred to the inpatient wing at HMP Pentonville on 29 September 2019.
There were significant barriers to communicating with Mr Popalzai as he spoke predominantly in Pashto. Throughout his time in the inpatient unit, Mr Popalzai was acutely psychotic. He was aggressive and most interactions with psychiatrists, healthcare staff and prison officers took place through the cell door. Mr Popalzai consistently refused to take any medication as he did not accept that he was mentally ill. Mr Popalzai stated on several occasions that he would hang himself if transferred to a psychiatric hospital. On 9 October 2019, Mr Popalzai was assessed by a psychiatrist who found that he was psychotic and needed to be transferred to hospital for treatment under section 48 Mental Health Act 1983. The Crystal Ward, which is the psychiatric intensive care unit at the Newham Centre for Mental Health, was identified as the appropriate unit. A second assessment was carried out by a psychiatrist from the Crystal Ward on 18 October. The 2nd psychiatrist agreed that Mr Popalzai should be detained on the Crystal Ward for assessment and treatment under section 48 Mental Health Act on 24 October 2019. However, there were no beds available on Crystal Ward at that time. On 21 November 2019, the Crystal Ward advised that a bed issued by the Ministry of Justice and arrangements were made for Mr Popalzai to be transferred to the Crystal Ward on the afternoon of 29 November 2019. At around 12.30 pm on 29 November 2019, Mr Popalzai was found hanging in his cell. Attempts were made to resuscitate Mr Popalzai but his death was confirmed by paramedics at the scene. The psychiatric evidence was consistent that: 1) the only effective treatment for Mr Popalzai’s psychosis was anti- psychotic medication; 2) anti-psychotic medication could not be given to him against his wishes in a prison setting. As a result, he needed to be transferred to an appropriate psychiatric unit. 3) Mr Popalzai’s mental health deteriorated in the time that he was waiting for a psychiatric bed to become available. I also heard evidence that a significant number of prisoners from HMP Pentonville were transferred to psychiatric units under the Mental Health Act each year. I was told that the experience of psychiatrists at the prison was that the target time of 14 days from 1st assessment to transfer set out in the statutory guidance was seldom met. I was also told that significant delays in beds becoming available were extremely common and delays of up to 6 months were not unheard of.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. 
1) Prisoners who are acutely psychotic and refusing treatment that requires transfer to hospital under the Mental Health Act are being left untreated and at risk of further deterioration due to a shortage of suitable psychiatric hospital bed spaces becoming available in a timely way.","On 4 December 2019, I commenced an investigation into the death of Abdullah Popalzai (20 years). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that the medical cause of death was 1a Suspension.

Brian JAMES aged 91 years suffered a Cerebral haemorrhage following fall at home. He lived at home with his brother. He got up in the night to pass water due to his overactive bladder and fell out of bed. He hit his head ( suffered abrasion) he did not lose consciousness and was alert and talking when police and fire came to assist as his brother could not get him back into bed. Ambulance was contacted however there was a delay of around 9 hours until their arrival.
Ambulance crew came to do a courtesy visit the following morning and he was found in bed GCS 3 and covered in his own vomit. CT head showed cerebral haemorrhage.
CT head findings discussed with neurosurgeons who said this man would not be for surgical intervention
He sadly passed away in hospital on 1st November 2021. The Inquest focused upon:-
The events of 30 October 2021 and leading to admission
 
whether any delay in admission to hospital and medical treatment was causative (more than minimally contributory) to death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
A script used by Operators within WAST as part of the Clinical Safety Plan inform callers not to call back for an estimated time of arrival of the ambulance. They are told to only call back if there is a deterioration in the patient’s condition.
 
During periods of a delayed response from an ambulance, WAST best practice is for an Operator to maintain regular contact with callers to assess any change in their condition. During periods of excessive demand, it is considered that this is not always achievable, and therefore Welfare calls are prioritised to callers considered vulnerable.
 
There may be a risk that callers do not understand the instruction to only call back if there is a deterioration, and/or may not recognise a deterioration, and feel they cannot call WAST again. There is a further risk that unless regular welfare calls are made during periods of delayed response, there is a missed opportunity to properly re-assess and re- grade the response to a call by WAST.",On 5 November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Brian JAMES . The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11/01/2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Mr James died following a fall at his home.

He had a long-term history of drug and alcohol misuse and was alcohol dependent. He had been arrested and detained in police custody on 4th September.
 
Mr Pryor was seen in police custody by Health Care Professionals (HCP’s) due to his documented opiate misuse, methadone usage and alcohol dependency. Mr Pryor was attended on four separate occasions by two different HCP’s whilst in custody. He was recognised to be dependent on alcohol and when he began to exhibit symptoms of withdrawal a HCP began a course of alcohol withdrawal medication to reduce the symptoms and guard against possible alcohol withdrawal related seizure.
 
The inquest jury returned the following conclusion: –
 
‘Mr Pryor suffered an alcohol withdrawal related seizure whilst detained in police custody which caused cardiorespiratory arrest and death. There were deficiencies in the health care professionals’ assessment and treatment of Mr Pryor’s alcohol withdrawal which probably made a more than minimal contribution to his death’.
 
The jury recorded the following findings: –
 
‘The HCP assessments were not of a reasonable standard due to the following reasons:
 
Assessments provided were substantially shorter than the recognised accepted practice and consistently shorter than would have been required to properly assess Mr Pryor effectively. In addition to this the time between assessments was too long, particularly after the critical dose of the withdrawal medication was administered, to ascertain the effectiveness.
 
Assessments were lacking in consistent information i.e. BP, pulse, heart rate and history. Previous assessments were not referenced prior to each visit, changes in vital signs were not acted upon.
 
Assessment records were inadequate and lacking in detail.
 
There was a point at which an increase in the withdrawal medication dose should have been
considered when Mr Pryor’s BP and pulse were not taken and found to be elevated. …..
 
Although not demonstrably contributory to Mr Pryor’s death, the jury records the following matters:
 
There were inadequacies in the training and induction provided to the lesser experienced HCP who attended Mr Pryor.
 
It is also clear that the lesser experienced HCP did not have suitable experience and skills to work as an HCP’.
 
The lesser experienced HCP had previously worked as a mental health nurse.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
I am concerned that Health Care Professionals (HCPs) may not be receiving sufficient and adequate training to enable them to practice effectively or safely in police custody suites. This is based on the evidence and findings in Mr Pryor’s inquest and my understanding that the training provided by HCRG may be very similar to that given by other providers of HCP police custody services nationally.",On 07 September 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mark PRYOR aged 46.

He used alcohol to excess and prescribed medication to try and deal with his post- traumatic stress disorder. On 6th May 2023 he collapsed on Malvern Road, Old Trafford. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The inquest heard evidence that James Day had served his country as a member of the armed services. He had been deployed to Afghanistan as part of his service where he had witnessed traumatic events that had led to him developing post-traumatic stress disorder. He needed support to help him deal with the trauma. However that had not been provided in such a way whilst he was serving to allow him to deal with his PTSD. He had subsequently left the army and had continued to struggle to cope with his PTSD. He used alcohol and prescribed medication to try and cope with the severe symptoms of his PTSD.
 
The inquest heard that support for service personnel with severe PTSD such as Mr Day whilst they were still serving and following discharge was patchy, difficult to access and did not appear to recognise how significant the impact of events they had witnessed whist serving could be on their mental health.
 
The inquest heard that better mental health support whilst serving and following discharge may have avoided Mr Day having to turn to self- medication to try and have respite from his PTSD symptoms.",On 9th May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of James Colin Day.

Fm  much of his life Mr Ogbe-Millar was a heavy cannabis user, which led to his diagnosis with cannabis induced psychosis in 2020.
 
Mr Ogbe-Millar received treatment from community and in-patient mental health teams at various stages, including two hospital admissions under the Mental Health Act 1933 in late 2020 and in early 2021.
 
On being discharged from hospital in March 2021 he enjoyed a period free of cannabis and psychosis. He was able to work, attend Narcotics Anonymous and come off his medication _ This led to his discharge from the community mental health team in June 2021.
 
In November 2021 Mr Ogbe-Millar gave up his job and resumed using cannabis on a daily basis leading to a relapse of h is mental illness. His mother sought help from the community mental health team who spoke to Mr Ogbe-Millar by telephone on 26 November 2021 and referred him to a substance abuse organisation, which did 11ot specialise in psychosis. He was discharged by the community health team on 30  November  2021,  without  the  team  having obtained any information regarding his relapse from his mother.
 
In the early  hours of 2 December 2021, Mr Ogbe-Millar sent a text message to his mother saying:  “I’m sorry for my actions and I hope you all find peace”. His mother immediately telephoned the police who found Mr Ogbe-Millar at home [REDACTED]. 
 
The police took Mr Ogbe-Millar to the Emergency Department of Watford General Hospital, which is operated by West Hertfordshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (‘WHTHN T’) where there  was  all  inadequate  system  for  recording the information provided by the police to the hospital concerning his risk of self­ harm.
 
Mr Ogbe-Millar was assessed by hospital staff later that morning as a moderate risk of self-harm and told to await the arrival of the local Mental Health Liaison Team, which is operated by the Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (‘HPUNFT’)
 
Despite Mr Ogbe-Millar’s risk of self-harm and the protective factor provided by the presence of his mother, she was not allowed to stay with him at the
Emergrency Department while he waited for the Mental Health Liaison Team. Instead, she was required to leave, by staff in breach of hospital policy
 
The Mental Health Liaison Team had not arrived to assess Mr Ogbe-Millar by the time his mother was required to leave the hospital due to problems surrounding the referral system.
 
Soon after his mother had been required to leave, Mr Ogbe-Millar left the Emergency Department unaccompanied saying he was  going outside  to  smoke a cigarette.

He had been driving his new electric moped at about 1.30 am on the 1st June 2023 when he collided with street furniture and sustained catastrophic unsurvivable injuries. He had no prior experience of riding the moped. A nearby resident heard the collision and went to his aid and called emergency services. The call recording illustrates the first-aider’s increasing concern as Lucas deteriorated. Lucas can be heard in the background very clearly to be deteriorating rapidly and significantly. A Category 1 (C1) ambulance was dispatched followed by another as there were two casualties. C1 reflects an emergency response travelling with blue lights and sirens. The EEAST uses a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system which also automatically dispatched a solo paramedic in a rapid response vehicle (RRV). Fire co-responders were also deployed. A General Broadcast (GB) was not made. A GB is an alert to any other nearby resources who might possibly assist. EEAST policy requires a GB where there are no nearby resources. The first ambulance sent was based at the Luton ambulance station meaning it was greater than 20 minutes away. The second ambulance was also greater than 20 minutes away. The target response time for a C1 ambulance is an average of 7 minutes and 15 minutes for 90% of calls. It was known at the time of dispatch that it would greatly exceed the target time. A Critical Care Dispatcher was aware of the call and nature and considered deploying a Critical Care Team (CCT) but opted to let the crew from the first ambulance to assess and report. This was despite the crew being at least 20 minutes away. The nearest CCT was 42 minutes away by air. It was night which presents difficulties in safe landing etc. It was accepted on reflection that the CCT should have been sent. The RRV was 3 minutes from the scene. The proximity of the RRV was not revealed in the EEAS Serious Incident Investigation Report but emerged during questioning. The RRV was dispatched by the CAD but then immediately cancelled by a dispatcher due to the Trust’s End of Shift Policy seemingly without regard to the actuality of the situation, that the two dispatched ambulances were more than 20 minutes away, a CCT was not dispatched and that a RRV 3 minutes away could have rendered essential aid. The End of Shift Policy limits the calls crews can be dispatched to within the last one hour and last 30 minutes of their shift. The coding allocated to Lucas did not permit the RRV to be sent. As mentioned above, there was clear evidence through the call of Lucas’s markedly deteriorating condition. There appears to have been no coding reassessment. The Critical Care Dispatcher and the “routine” dispatcher were not in the same location but could see each other’s entries into the computer system in real time as they were made. There was no direct dialogue between them. There was no evidence of a dynamic overview reassessment of the situation as it progressed. Had there been, it is possible, likely even, that the RRV would have been deployed. Medical evidence was clear Lucas would not have survived but that was not known at the time of the call.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows:
It is not mandatory for prison officers to have basic first aid training (which includes the provision of CPR) which is in-date. Once a prison officer’s three-year period has expired, whilst they may be reminded by the prison establishment that their certification is no longer live, it is not mandatory for them to renew this. For example, at HMP Manchester, at present 52% of prison staff received Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW) training within the past three years as part of their initial officer training. Therefore, 48% of prison staff will have training certification (which includes CPR) which has expired. The evidence admitted was that the main reason for this is due to it not being mandatory for prison staff to have up-to-date training.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 1st April 2024.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The inquest heard evidence that because Mrs Bracegirdle was in a care home setting the District Nurses were responsible for management of her pressure ulcers. The care home was asked to ensure pressure relieving processes were followed. However, the District Nurses did not share care plans with the care team on the basis that they were digital documents and were care plans for the use of District Nurses. As a consequence, the care home management were not fully sighted, and joint care was more difficult to deliver increasing the risk of the pressure ulcers deteriorating.
 
There was no communication strategy in place as a consequence of an approach that did not promote team /joint working. The inquest heard that as a consequence the family were unsighted on the condition of Mrs Bracegirdle until shortly before her admission to hospital. This meant that the family could not support the work to reduce the risk of the pressure ulcers deteriorating further and were not able to be a proactive about the care she was receiving increasing the risk of her pressure ulcers deteriorating",On 10th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Susan Wendy BRACEGIRDLE.

This impacted on his day-to-day health and well being. He had a complex past medical history to include depression, [REDACTED] addiction and chronic multi system, medically unexplained symptoms of unclear cause. There had not been a formal diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome as there
was minimal evidence to reach this but he was under specialist care provided by the Clinical Immunology Department at Derriford Hospital who were providing valuable advice and guidance to manage his symptoms. Guy had previously disclosed to his sister, GP and Mental Health Services that he had researched ways to end his life and at one stage stated he had a plan in place but that he did not intend to act on those plans. He had some contact with mental health services and engaged in 3 intervention sessions with Wellbeing Coaches in October 2022 following which he reported feeling better. His final contact with the Mental Health Connect team was on 15th May 2023 when he reported ongoing chronic suicidal ideation. He agreed to contact with his GP and a safety plan was discussed. A review was held with his GP on 31st May 2023 at which time his physical and mental health was discussed at length. There was no change in his chronic suicidal thoughts, and he was keen to explore treatment and support for his condition. He declined any referral for further mental health or psychology services at that time.
 
Guy contacted his sister on the telephone in the early hours of 1st July 2023 and his opening comment was that he loved her. She stated that she would call him later. On attempting to contact him later that morning she was unable to get a response and raised a concern for welfare. Police officers attended his home address and he was found deceased in the bath. His death was confirmed at 15:24 on 1 July 2023. His death was due to Asphyxiation.
 
Police Officers at the scene located a printed 60-page document at his home address titled “[REDACTED]” which had been printed from a website [REDACTED]. Police enquiries confirmed that this company received and delivered an order and they also provided a copy invoice dated 28/04/2022.","During the course of the investigation, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She remained there until her discharge to the family home on 26th January 2023. She was commenced on Olanzapine and Zopiclone for her mental health whilst an inpatient.   ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1. The inquest heard evidence that a shortage of mental health beds nationally meant that the situation that arose here of a placement out of area many miles from home was not unusual and that private beds were being used on a regular basis due to a shortage of NHS beds. The inquest heard that this meant that there were a number of consequences as a result all of such placements which could as in Ms Khan’s case impact on a patient and increase the risk they presented. In particular:","On 15th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shahzadi Khan. The investigation concluded on the 23rd November 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative:

In 2022, his condition deteriorated. His GP referred him twice to the Community Mental Health Team but the referrals were rejected with medication being prescribed instead, together with advice to contact Talking Therapies.   ","During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
The Trust’s Patient Safety Review identified the following concerns:
 
When Mr Gerasimidis was referred by his GP to the community mental health team, he was screened out, in part, due to challenging staffing issues;
No care coordinator was appointed owing to a shortage of staff;
The Trust had and continues to have vacancies at consultant level;
The family was wrongly advised the Trust was not commissioned to treat OCD;
The family was not informed of a nearest relative’s right under the Mental Health Act to request a case review by an AMHP;
Psychological treatment in the form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Exposure Response Prevention had a waiting list of one year;
In May 2023, when it was felt Mr Gerasimidis required an informal admission into hospital, no beds were available.
 
The difficulties with staff recruitment and bed availability are long term problems in the Cornwall coroner area. The Patient Safety Review suggests Cornwall has fewer beds for its population than other areas. It is the persistent or recurring nature of these concerns that leads me to believe action should be taken.","On 3/6/23, I concluded the inquest into the death of Nicolas Gerasimidis.

In 2010 he was confirmed to have an allergy to nuts and in particular peanuts.
 
He was prescribed an Epi-pen and antihistamines to manage his allergy. His Epi-pen was renewed only on his request, James last requested his Epi-pen in 2015. He attended 3 asthma reviews prior to his death. His allergy was not addressed during the reviews. There was no regular allergy review procedure provided locally or nationally.
 
On 10 July 2020 he ordered food for himself and flatmates from Dadyal Takeaway Restaurant. Their menu contained limited information as to the ingredients used in the dishes produced and no allergen information or allergen matrix. James ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala pizza. The presence of peanuts in both the dishes produced and in use in the kitchen was not referred to in the menu. James knew about his nut/peanut allergy. He did not contact Dadyal to advise of his allergy and was unaware that the Chicken Tikka Masala pizza ordered contained mixed nut powder comprising of up to 99 per cent peanuts. He suffered an allergic reaction shortly after consuming the pizza. He called an ambulance which arrived within four minutes of his call. His Epi-pen could not be located; missing an opportunity for an adrenaline injection prior to Paramedic arrival.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The evidence in this case unequivocally established that James was not under regular review for his allergy, risk of anaphylaxis and the benefits of automatic adrenalin injectors.
 
The report of [REDACTED] (attached) identifies the need for wider consideration of a systematic approach to improving anaphylaxis awareness and management.
 
The risk of future deaths in the context of allergy/anaphylaxis remains in the absence of an appropriate structure to educate, review and manage those who are diagnosed allergies.","On 16 July 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of James ATKINSON.

Anaphylaxis following peanut ingestion
James Stuart Atkinson died on 10th July 2020 after eating a Chicken Tikka Masala pizza 3 purchased from Dadyal Takeaway Restaurant in Newcastle upon Tyne via Deliveroo application. The pizza contained peanuts to which he was allergic.
 
The Dadyal menu did not contain specific information in respect of peanuts or other allergens.
 
James did not contact the takeaway to advise them of his allergy.

He was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital on 15th March 2023 after the GP examined him and was concerned about how frail he was. On admission no clear reversible cause was identified. He was put on Nil by Mouth due to his poor oesophageal functionality. He presented a high risk of aspiration.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

The evidence before the inquest was that there were situations where clinicians would attribute a deterioration to the aging process rather than consider the whole picture and investigate if there was a treatable condition.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
There is no requirement for a risk assessment to be carried out before a patient is placed in a side room (other than for risk of falls), so as to identify if they will have any risks and difficulties associated with communicating their needs to staff in an emergency situation.
 
There is no formal requirement to ensure that a patient is risk assessed with regard to ability to use a call bell and, if they are unable, to consider suitable alternatives, especially when in a side room and there is no other way to attract staff attention.",On 20 May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jeanine Maria HUGGINS aged 68.

Christopher Kapessa, aged 13, attended the Red Bridge at Abercwmboi in the afternoon of 1st July 2019, meeting a group of school friends of largely the same age, some of whom intended to jump into the water. Christopher took with him clothes in which he could swim, undressed to his shorts and approached the water side. He had not decided whether to enter the water and was expressing both a desire to swim and concern due to his limited ability to swim. At about 17.25, while he was standing by the water side looking in to the river, he was deliberately pushed in to the water by another child, falling 2.5 metres to the water surface.  There was a current.  The water was cold and too deep for him to touch the bottom and keep his head above the surface. Christopher was swiftly in difficulty, thrashing ineffectively with his arms.  Children, including the boy who had pushed him, jumped in to the water to try to save him, but were unable to do so. He became submerged. Some of the children sought help and the emergency services attended and carried out a search, finding Christopher underwater at about 19.25. Resuscitation attempts took place but after so long a period submerged, Christopher could not be saved.
 
The narrative conclusion which I returned was:
 
Christopher Kapessa, aged 13, died by submersion when intentionally pushed by another child into the river Cynon. The push was a dangerous prank. However, the child responsible for it did not intend to cause Christopher’s death and himself jumped into the water with other children in an unsuccessful attempt at rescue.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She was found by her son in her garden hanging [REDACTED]. In December 2022 Rachel Mortimer took an overdose of [REDACTED]. A Mental health act assessment was undertaken but she was not deemed to require sectioning at this time. On 18 June 2023 Rachel was seen by the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) at Barnsley Hospital after taking an overdose of prescribed [REDACTED] and trying to hang herself. She said she had been having suicidal thoughts for a long time, she did not regret her actions and that thoughts of her family did not stop her. She was assessed by the MHLT as having risk of future impulsive self harm and suicide when using alcohol and risk of further deterioration of her mental state without timely appropriate mental health support to develop coping skills. She was referred to IHBTT and was discharged from hospital. No MHA assessment was undertaken. She was seen by IHBTT and her risks of emotional dysregulation without engaging in therapy and risk of harmful alcohol use were identified. She was to be referred to BSARCS and told to refer herself to recovery services as mitigation. She was assessed as low risk of suicide even though she had initially stated she was not regretful of what done and disappointed that she had not died, she was assessed as not having current suicidal thoughts or intentions of suicide and wanted to engage in therapy. She was provided with contact numbers to call if she wanted to discuss her mental health at any time.
 
Unfortunately, whilst she was referred to BSARCS she was not accepted. Despite this being a risk factor no other mitigation was offered at this time and therefore the risk was not mitigated.
  
On 21 June at 4pm IBHTT Rachel’s mother contacted IHBTT with concerns, she was told that Rachel should contact the GP for access to services and that they could not provide any information due to data protection. At no point was Mrs Mortimer provided any information on what to do if she was concerned for Rachels safety such as taking her to ED or that Rachel could contact certain mental health services to discuss her feelings in a crisis. A further call was made at 5.30pm, an hour and a half later, by Rachel’s son, who expressed concerns that she was expressing suicidal ideas, again no signposting was given. A further call was made on the same day by paramedics with concerns and again they were told that she had been advised to contact her GP. No signposting was provided or consideration given to the fact previously identified risks which had not been mitigated and she was drinking which had been identified as having a risk of future impulsive self harm and suicide.
 
Despite these 3 contacts by family and paramedics, at no point was any safety netting in terms of the options available if they were concerned provided, such as to take her to ED or for her to call any mental health services given. A phone call was made that evening to Rachel but as Police were with her she was unable to discuss and asked for a call back later which was not answered.
 
IHBTT discussed Rachel on 22 June 2023 and decided she should be called for a review of her mental state and risks and to offer secondary mental health follow up. 7 telephone calls were made between 22 and 26 June with no success. IHBTT knowing that she had had 2 previous suicide attempts, had risk factors that had not been mitigated and had recently been contacted on by family with significant concerns that she was suicidal the IHBTT treatment team took no further action and on 26 June, with no contact, assessed her as low risk due to lack of contact.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Thomas Ithell was aged 77 at the time of his death on 20 November 2022. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2017 and biopsies revealed bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate. He underwent radiotherapy in 2018 and hormone deprivation treatment. From April 2021 onwards his PSA levels increased periodically. In October 2021 his level was 5.5ng/ml having been 1.5ng/m lin April 2021 and 2.7ng/m in July 2021 indicating a recurrence of the cancer and likely incurable. Thomas Ithell was reluctant to undergo further hormone treatment as he found tolerating the side effects difficult. He did not then have his PSA levels tested after November 2021 and was not reviewed at all due to becoming missed to follow up. After he had been seen by the nurse practitioner on 5 November 2021 the letter written by the nurse practitioner for advice from the consultant did not reach the consultant. He was reviewed by a consultant on 22 October 2022 after an urgent suspected cancer GP referral following routine set of blood tests in September 2022, some 10 months later.

There was no Datix raised by anyone when the error (Mr Ithell being lost to follow up) was identified, either at the time of the appointment on 22 October 2022 when the error was identified or at any point thereafter;

There have been no assurances as to what, if any, changes and learning have been identified other than a tracking system for PSA monitoring;
 
Evidence was heard at the Inquest that time restraints on hospital staff had meant that Datix was not completed and that the system was not user-friendly.
 
I have raised a number of Prevention of Future Death reports with the Health Board previously around investigation processes. I remain incredibly concerned that where matters are not raised in accordance with internal Health Board processes that assurances given to me previously in Prevention of Future Death Reports cannot be supported.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The following matters of concern are directed to Sodexo for response –
 
It is important to note that at the time of Kane’s death, the prison was managed by Serco Ltd under a contract awarded by HMPPS. Since Kane’s death, the contract for managing the prison has been awarded to Sodexo. Sodexo were invited to submit learning evidence to the court, if such existed, but instead said they would respond to any prevention of future death report I felt was necessary.
 
A number of the prison staff involved in Kane’s care in October 2021 continue to work at the prison and were unaware of local policy in relation to the matters below as of present times.
 
Having received no formal evidence of any changes made at HMP Lowdham Grange, and staff having failed to report any evidence of changes, I highlight the following concerns –
 
1. Ignoring Cell Bells
I heard evidence that staff were engaging in the deliberate ignoring of prisoner cell bells. I have seen no local policy which either prohibits such activity, or, if such activity is permitted, supports staff to make risk-based considerations about how and when to ignore cell bells.
 
I observe that deliberately ignoring cell bells appears to be a wholly dangerous practice as the cell bell is the only method of communication between prisoner and staff during periods of lock up, including night state. The practice appears to be all the more dangerous when one considers some staff suspected Kane to be in a state of heightened emotion and acting under the influence of alcohol.
 
Isolating power to cells
As above, I have seen no policy which supports the isolation of power to cells including who has the power to make such a decision, how long the power should be isolated for, and whether staff are required to consider any risk factors when determining whether to isolate power to the cell.
 
Failure to follow the local Under the Influence Policy
Three members of staff suspected Kane was under the influence of something in the hours before his death, yet none opened an under the influence log or sought any medical advice about how frequently to check on him, what signs of deterioration to look out for, and when to seek further assistance.
 
Lack of understanding of Prison Service Instruction 64/2011, and possible discord between local policy and the PSI
A number of prison officers believed Kane’s birthday was incapable of amounting to a “key date or anniversary” for the purposes of PSI 64/2011. It seems to me to be common sense that a birthday, being the anniversary of one’s birth, could amount to a potential trigger date for heightened emotions which considering a prisoner’s risk of self harm and suicide. That is not to say it would be so for each and every prisoner, but perhaps something to be cognisant of when dealing with an emotional and intoxicated prisoner. I have seen no evidence that this is covered in Sodexo’s training for staff on the ACCT process, if indeed any series of training exists.
 
A number of prison officers gave evidence that an ACCT was not necessary because Kane had not said to anyone that he was going to harm himself (either fatally or otherwise). Serco’s Safer Prison Operating Policy (August 2022) is confusing on this point and seems to suggest at paragraph 3.4 that staff should only open an ACCT when a statement of self-harm has been verbalised. This is not consistent with the PSI. Sodexo have not offered for scrutiny any local policy, guidance or training material on the threshold for opening an ACCT, but even if such exists, it appears some staff continue to labour under the misapprehension that a prisoner must say they are thinking of harming themselves before an ACCT can be opened.
 
A failure to implement learning from the investigations that follow deaths in custody
Many of the staff giving evidence explained that they had not read the PPO report, nor were they aware of the issues identified by the PPO prior to giving evidence at the inquest. I have seen no evidence of the systems in place at HMP Lowdham Grange to seek to learn from deaths in custody at the earliest opportunity.
 
The following matters of concern are addressed to The Minister for Prisons and Probation, HMPPS –
 
Poor Quality Early Learning Review process, November 2021
While it is recognised that the ELR process is designed to capture information at a very early stage of the investigation, it is nevertheless an important tool in seeking to identify safety issues that should be addressed swiftly in order to prevent future deaths.
 
The central issue in this case was obvious from the outset, as recorded in various intelligence reports submitted by staff on the night of the death, namely, a number of members of staff suspected Kane to be under the influence of alcohol yet failed to take the necessary steps to seek to safeguard against harm.
 
On page 4 of the ELR it is concluded that “all procedures were followed” and there were no local or national recommendations for learning lessons. It is difficult to rationalise this conclusion against the evidence available even at the earliest stages of the investigation. The author was clearly aware that staff had considered Kane to be under the influence of alcohol (see page 1) and should have been aware that no Under the Influence Log existed. The author simply notes that “the policy has been reviewed”. There is no explanation as to why the policy wasn’t followed. Was the policy unclear in its requirements? Was there an absence of staff training on the policy? Of great concern to me is the fact that staff giving evidence at the inquest still seemed to fail to grasp the significance of intoxication as a risk factor for self-harm.
 
My concerns extend beyond the quality of the report, but also to the accuracy of the same.
 
The report is written in such a way as to create the impression that the author interviewed key members of staff. Comments are attributed to staff at particular points in time, yet all prison staff witnesses denied ever having been interviewed as part of the ELR process. It is unclear exactly what methodology the author has used during the investigation. I am concerned that the quality of the investigation has led to missed opportunities to have identified these issues at the outset.
 
7. A Lack of Candour – both organisationally and individually
I would be very interested to understand how the duty of candour applies to the prison service and those individuals within the employ of the service (whether employed directly or through a private provider, as in this case).
 
There is a statutory duty of candour applicable to healthcare organisations and professionals, as well as a more recent agreement by the College of Policing for members to adhere to a Code of Candour.
 
In practise, candour creates a culture of being open and honest with all stakeholders by accepting when things go wrong, taking remedial steps as soon as practicable, and thus reducing the risk of events repeating themselves. In the context of a death, candour from the outset is essential in order to support the bereaved family.
 
The position adopted by Serco in this inquest, as it has in other inquests, could be said to represent the very opposite of candour. Having heard evidence supplied on Oath by their own staff members that there were multiple failures to open an under the influence log (evidence which was not contested) the organisation nevertheless required the Jury to return a finding on this issue, and each and every issue, instead of a factual finding being presented to the jury as agreed by all Interested Persons.
 
The inquest is not an adversarial process, there is no burden of proof. The Interested Persons are under a duty to assist the investigative process in an open and honest manner by identifying those issues that genuinely require determination by the jury, and those on which there is agreement. Sadly, in my extensive experience of conducting Article 2 inquests locally, this is not an isolated example of the uncomfortable position adopted by the prison service in failing to put forward sensible and reasonable factual admissions of shortcomings.
 
I am concerned by the apparent absence of a culture of candour supporting those staff who work within the prison service. Many of the staff members giving evidence explained that the inquest was the first time it had been suggested to them that they had not adhered to policy. In the intervening period of over two years between Kane’s death and the inquest, no-one at the prison had asked key staff to reflect on the care they provided to Kane that night and consider areas of learning. Again, this is not a position unique to this inquest, and is of great concern in the context of a rising number of self-inflicted prisoner deaths at HMP Lowdham Grange since Kane’s tragic death in 2021.
 
I would be grateful if your response could address what steps have been, or are being taken, to ensure that candour is applied throughout the death in custody process.","Kane Christopher Boyce died by ligature asphyxiation on 3 October 2021, at HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, where he was detained as a serving prisoner.

The Deceased was a third-year student at university and was neurodiverse. He had been struggling with the pressures of his third year of study, following irregularities created and imposed on his otherwise established study routine and rhythm of daily living as a result of successive lockdowns. He had also fallen ill with Covid-19 in March 2022 and was believed to have been suffering long covid symptoms in the subsequent months. His illness had impacted on his concentration and his ability to perform, as well as causing chronic fatigue and insomnia. As a result, he had fallen behind in his third-year project and, it is believed, had determined that he was going to be unable to successfully pass his year of study, thereby preventing his ability to proceed at university and halting his ambition to pursue his academic career. It is believed that these factors had had an overwhelming effect on him, leading, on 30 June 2022 – the day of the publication of his exam results – to an acute anxiety crisis out of which he was unable to see a path. Although he had left no clear explanation of his feelings or reason for his actions, the evidence established that it was more likely than not that he had jumped from the bridge in a moment of acute distress in the early hours of the morning. There was no evidence to suggest that he had accidentally fallen to his death and no evidence of any third-party involvement. It was found that his actions were impulsive yet deliberate in their intent to take his own life, whilst suffering an acute anxiety crisis.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Matthew was neurodiverse. It was accepted that this condition was not known by the university at the relevant time, as he was diagnosed after his commencement on his course and did not disclose his condition to the university. In the circumstances, appropriate actions and case specific assistance which might otherwise have been available to and assisted Matthew were neither implemented in response nor accessed by him. Notwithstanding Matthew’s neurodiverity – which of itself was a barrier to him being able to reach out or to seek help – I am concerned about the level of awareness, understanding and curiosity of academic staff around the mental health of students, particularly in the post-pandemic climate, where interruptions to their study and dysregulated student life have had a significant impact on their mental health.
 
Whilst it was explained to me that all staff are offered training on mental health management and are provided with guidance on how to support students, I am concerned that aspects of this are not made compulsory for academic staff. Where a myriad of training options are made available to staff and often required of them, with very little practical time available in which to do it, there is a risk that modules and aids with regard to mental health will not be prioritised, followed through or addressed. There is as I understand it no evident monitoring in respect of which staff have viewed or undertaken what training or indeed in respect of who has completed the modules on offer. It remains unclear as to who or how many staff have actually viewed or undertaken the online training around student mental health.
 
Although the process of ‘raising a concern’ by academic staff is a means by which such matters can be considered and is a process set up and encouraged through the student hubs, I am concerned that in not ensuring that academic staff are at least armed with the ability to spot or to know when to make initial enquiries of students or are clearly guided on how best to do so (particularly with regard to an understanding of the needs and skills required to liaise with students with neurodiversity), there is a risk that an over-focus on academic policies and procedures will endure and that those students who are struggling to adhere to them will be missed or overlooked.",On 30 June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew George WICKES aged 21. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 August 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 I am concerned that the current clinical and public health guidelines do not identify Healthcare professionals as a group at heightened risk of TB exposure.
I am concerned that the current definition of ‘close contact’, thus triggering a contact trace or warn and inform letter, sets the bar too high for notifying NHS staff of the risk of exposure to TB.
I am concerned that there are insufficient education measures in place to inform NHS staff of the TB symptoms to looks out for, and the need to inform any assessing clinician of their possible exposure to the condition in order to facilitate early diagnostic testing.
Carrianne was exposed to a very aggressive form of TB from what seemed to be a rather transient exposure to the index patient during her occupation as a Nurse. Of course, not each and every contact with a patient will be logged within the medical records, especially in relation to an ambulatory patient such as the index patient in this case, and so it is possible that Carrianne had greater exposure to the patient while on the ward than interrogation of the medical records would suggest. But at its height, she had only been at work on the unit at the same time as the index patient over 23 and 24 November.
 
The index patient was cared for in a side room with infection prevention measures in place but Carrianne may well have been unaware that the infectious disease in question was TB as she was not the “named nurse” for this patient and lots of patients had increased infection prevention measures in place during the pandemic. Indeed, Carrianne had denied any known TB exposure when asked by doctors during her respiratory illness.
 
Carrianne’s case highlights the increased transmissibility of smear positive TB in the context of limited exposure to the index patient. I heard evidence from an expert who told me of cases of medical professionals contracting the condition despite no known direct contact with the patient but having spent time in a corridor containing an air vent leading from the infected patient’s room.
 
The warn and inform parameters did not alter (as in broaden) to reflect the fact that the index case was smear positive and highly transmissible, and the patient was known to be ambulatory on the ward. I cannot see a good reason for restricting the warn and inform letter process, rather than applying the same broadly to all staff who worked on the unit at the relevant time.
 
Carrianne’s case highlights the importance of warning all staff of TB cases on their wards, so that if they do become symptomatic in the coming months, and it may be many months later, they will be equipped with the necessary information to share with their treating clinicians.
 
I heard evidence that the NHS hospital’s Occupational Health team will issue contact tracing or warn and inform letters to staff, but this may not include Agency workers, and, in this case, Nurses seconded from the RAF. This is a missed opportunity to ensure that the relevant OH team or GP is aware of the potential exposure to add to the clinical picture should the patient develop atypical respiratory symptoms.
 
I understand that your agency has input into the UK’s TB Action Plan, and I hope that the above concerns can be considered in your drive to reduce the incidence of TB nationally, but also specifically with regard to healthcare professionals to ensure they are given the greatest possible protection from TB related harm and death.","Carrianne Franks died on 27 August 2021, at the Bassetlaw District Hospital, Nottinghamshire, as a result of Tuberculosis.

The police were especially concerned that the extended height ladder appliance had not been requested from the outset, given that the call was in respect of a person on the roof of a block of flats.
 
I did not take evidence from any firefighters at inquest, and so I appreciate that there may be elements of which I am unaware.","On 8 August 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of [REDACTED].

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The Deceased’s parents informed the attending police officer that Mr Helstrip had been buying drugs from the “Dark Web” and that packages containing these drugs had been sent, recorded delivery, via Royal Mail to his premises. Despite this, the police investigation concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement surrounding Mr Helstrip’s death and hence no criminal investigation took place. This was based on the attending officer’s impression, which did not appear to take into consideration the information about the sourcing and method of delivery of the drugs. Subsequently, Mr Helstrip’s parents contacted the then Chief Constable of Humberside Police, in 2023 informing him of their concerns about the lack of investigation on the part of the police. A senior investigating officer was then allocated to the case, who looked at the issue of illicit drugs being sent via Royal Mail, by recorded delivery, to see whether the vendor of these substances could be identified and help police with their inquiries. Evidence was heard from this detective, that whilst the investigation is still on-going, time sensitive evidence in the form of CCTV footage from the post office from whence the package was sent, is irretrievably lost, and that this has compromised the identification of the suspect.","On 30th September 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Steven Helstrip, aged 18 years.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Evidence was heard that the height of drop from the edge of the promenade to the sand at the location John fell, whilst on his mobility scooter, was approximately 5 feet.
 
The court was told that, at a number of locations, the height from the edge of the promenade to the sand was prone to change, and a system was in place to monitor this. It was however, acknowledged, that unusual high tide conditions, and/or weather activity could significantly change the drop height in a short period of time.
 
Evidence heard that at high-risk locations, such as areas with persistent long drops, drops onto concrete, or drops onto rock sea defences, permanent barriers were installed.
 
In other areas signage and/or painted markings were used to highlight the risks of a potential fall.
 
It was acknowledged that individuals on mobility scooters were known to regularly access and use the promenade. Due to the demographics of the local area it was acknowledged that the use of mobility scooters on the promenade may increase in the future.
 
Evidence was also heard from a mobility scooter supplier and engineer, who explained that falling asleep on a mobility scooter was not uncommon, and happened more frequently than the general public might think. The supplier explained that this often led to accidents, leading to damage to the mobility scooters, which required repair.
 
I am therefore concerned that falls from the promenade onto the beach, in areas where there is no barrier, would occur again in similar circumstances, as the current signage and markings provide no warning to an individual asleep on their mobility scooter.
 
If this were to occur (as in this case) in an area where the height of drop from the edge of the promenade to the sand was greater than normally expected, I am concerned this would lead to future loss of life.","On 20 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of:   John Thomas GRAY

The headache was associated with vomiting, fever, chills and light sensitivity. There was concern she had suffered a brain bleed so a CT scan was arranged which was misreported as normal as it was later found to show some subtle signs of cerebral swelling but no brain bleed. Had the CT scan been correctly reported it is likely a referral would have been made through NORSE to specialist neurosurgeons and the condition would have been identified and successfully treated. Clinicians advised that a lumber puncture was necessary to confirm or rule out a brain bleed. This was explained to Mrs Kuklinska who was advised of the risks and benefits of a lumber puncture and given an information leaflet but she declined a lumber puncture and self-discharged against medical advice. She was advised to see her GP about the high blood pressure which was identified at the hospital. Given the strong clinical signs of a brain bleed and refusal of lumber puncture a referral should have been made through NORSE to the specialist neurosurgeons which would on balance have identified the condition and successful treatment would have been provided. She attended her GP on 28/06/23 and was prescribed blood pressure medication. On 07/07/23 she advised the GP her headache had resolved as her blood pressure became normal.

1. The inquest heard evidence from a specialist neurosurgeons at University Hospital Birmingham that there are guidelines to confirm a patient with strong clinical signs of a brain bleed, should be referred through NORSE particularly when they have refused a lumber puncture which is the usual test undertaken in accordance with the NICE guidelines. Clinicians at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital City hospital site said they were unaware of those guidelines and didn’t consider a referral for Mrs Kuklinska.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Consideration should be given to the review of the treatment, monitoring and management of patients with a history of epilepsy or seizures by both the prison staff and healthcare staff. In particular, there was no seizure care plan, no seizure diary and once the ACCT had closed on 10th March 2021, there was no formal mechanism of monitoring Trevor’s condition. Further, the ACCT is not a suitable mechanism for such monitoring. The CSRA policy is designed to protect other prisoners, but not those who suffer from medical conditions as Trevor suffered. PPG in their evidence to be considered relating to PFD matters state that a care plan dashboard is now in place at HMP Lewes but this does not appear to be individualized or tailored to the prisoner’s clinical requirements.
 
Communication between healthcare and prison staff especially when Trevor was returned to the wing, between the prison staff and family, briefing by prison managers to officers on the wing about Trevor’s condition were all inadequate.
 
Evidence was heard about the lack of integration of various IT systems which contributed to poor communication. In spite of the evidence from PPG regarding the sensitivity of medical records which should not be disclosed to the prison staff, I remain concerned that there was no effective monitoring and management of Trevor on the wing once the ACCT was closed. There was no mechanism in place for prison and healthcare staff to report their concerns about Trevor’s non compliance with taking his medication to Security, thus preventing the cell from being searched for retained medication.
 
There was a lack of training of prison staff in dealing with long term health conditions such as epilepsy on the wings. I understand there is a deficit in national policy within the prison service to manage and support prisoners with epilepsy and seizures.",On 22 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Trevor Alan MONERVILLE aged 33.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 September 2023.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 07, 2024.

A chest x-ray was performed on 29 November 2022 which showed right upper lobe pneumonia and some pleural effusion. Iona was escalated from high-flow nasal cannula oxygen to continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”).   Iona continued to receive antibiotics and her condition appeared to improve. On 30 November 2022 she was stepped down from high-dependency care.   ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Following Iona’s death, the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust conducted a Serious Incident Investigation. One of the recommendations made by the investigation panel was:
 
“Children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should be suspected of having a pleural effusion and should get an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”
 
That recommendation reflected advice provided on 29th November 2022 (the day after Iona’s admission to Northampton General Hospital) by the East Midlands Paediatric Critical Care Network:
 
“We would like to inform you of a high number of cases of highly aggressive sepsis, linked to empyema, and positive culture for Group A Streptococcus in the region. This has caused significant morbidity and mortality.
We advise early referral, aggressive management, high dose intravenous antibiotics, and early drainage of empyemas.
Please have a low threshold for investigating any child with a secondary respiratory deterioration, especially with new onset of fever. Chest X-Ray and ultrasound will be beneficial.”
 
At the inquest into Iona’s death, I heard evidence from the Trust’s Clinical Director of the Child Health Directorate who is also a Consultant Paediatrician.
 
On the basis of the evidence I heard from the Clinical Director, I am satisfied that the Trust has taken action in respect of the recommendations made and more broadly have reflected upon the circumstances of Iona’s death. However, in respect of the recommendation set out above, I am concerned that there remains a risk that future deaths could occur unless further action is taken.
 
The recommendation made by the investigation panel was that children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should get “an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”. However, the evidence I heard suggests this is not possible.
 
I heard from the Clinical Director that as a district general hospital, Northampton General Hospital does not have access to a paediatric radiologist outside of 9am-5pm on Mondays and Fridays when such a specialist is either on duty or on-call. I heard evidence that in Iona’s case, a Consultant in ITU and Anaesthesia was able to perform an ultrasound scan at around 2pm on 4th December 2022 however this is not a facility that would routinely be available to the Trust and was not, in any event, part of that clinician’s core duties.
 
I am concerned that a very unwell child who may require a chest ultrasound may not receive one ‘immediately’ and in fact may have to wait for a considerable period of time. For example, if the need arose over a weekend, that child may not receive an ultrasound scan for up to 48 hours.","On 14th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Iona Grace Buckingham, aged 9 months.

At 22.51PM Mr. KING’s wife called 999 and spoke with an ambulance service call handler. Following triage of the call, the response to Mr. KING’s call was graded as a Category 3 (a potentially urgent condition which is not life threatening with a target response of 120 minutes). This call was subsequently re-graded following review in the call centre at 23.18PM to a Category 2 (a potentially serious condition requiring rapid assessment, urgent on scene intervention or transport to hospital, with a response within 40 minutes and a target of 18 minutes).   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Availability of ambulances to carry out transfers in a timely manner, in urgent cases, between NHS Hospitals and in responding to 999 and 111 calls in the community.
Confusion as between ambulance and hospital staff and a lack of clarity in the purpose of and process for the categorisation of transfers (particularly in urgent situations) between NHS hospitals.
The suitability of the NHS approach to centralising exigent care in regional centres (such as the Royal Papworth Hospital for cardiac conditions) if the means to deliver such an approach are inadequate.
Adequacy of the action plan provided to the court in addressing the concern at (a) above and that of ambulance attendances to 999 and 111 calls; the plan is generalised, lacking detail and any means of measurement of progress.
 
Evidence received at Inquest identified waits for ambulance attendance of between 5-6 hours on the evening of 9th/10th December 2022. This, in circumstances where the call relating to Mr. KING had been categorised as a category 2 response. In Mr. KING’s case he was exhibiting symptoms of having suffered/was suffering a heart attack.
 
In Mr. KING’s case he had arrived at hospital been triaged, assessed and arrangements for urgent lifesaving care made by competent emergency clinicians in conjunction with experts from the regional cardiac unit. This included the requirement for an urgent transfer to the regional cardiac centre. A request for an emergency transfer from West Suffolk Hospital to The Royal Papworth Hospital was subject to further computer algorithm-based triage by the ambulance service. This resulted in a several hour delay to Mr. KING’s transfer, notwithstanding the protests from competent clinical staff in the Accident and Emergency Department at West Suffolk Hospital.
 
The circumstances of this case raise concerns about the NHS approach to centralising exigent care in regional centres (such as the Royal Papworth Hospital for cardiac conditions) if the means to deliver the approach are inadequate.
 
East of England Ambulance Service provided evidence to the Inquest, including a Report concerning its response.

Tammy was assessed as being at high and ongoing risk of ingesting foreign objects, a risk which had materialised on many occasions prior to her death, and often lead to hospital admission. Her risk of self-harm by ingestion led to the lawful use of mechanical restraints, comprising of mittens, a bio belt, eyesight or arm’s length observations, controlled and supervised access to items when spending time out of her mittens, and a total restriction on Tammy having free access to personal items. On 22 March 2021, hospital staff provided Tammy was a twistable crayon to use while her mittens were removed. The twistable crayon had not been risk assessed or approved for use by Tammy’s MDT, who were responsible for setting her care plan. In those circumstances, the twistable crayon ought not to have been provided to her. If the crayon had been presented to the MDT, her Consultant Psychiatrist would not have approved its use as it would have posed an obvious risk of serious harm if ingested due to its size and plastic structure. Instead, alternative child-safe small wax crayons could have been used to meet the same therapeutic purpose. At this time, the Trust did not have any documented system that set out the requirements for the MDT to approve the use of risk items, but this was nevertheless an expectation on the MDT, which they failed to complete. There is no clear or consistent record of who was observing Tammy or what items she had been granted access to on 22 March 2021. Despite the crayon being noted as “missing” from the pack, no incident report was completed, nor was the Security Manager alerted or any ward level plan initiated to seek to locate the risk item. Tammy started to present with symptoms of a complication of swallowing the item the next day. She reported nausea after eating, vomiting and epigastric tenderness. Mental health staff escalated her symptoms to the physical healthcare team. Tammy reported to the Advanced Clinical Practitioner that she could feel the twistable crayon inside her. The ACP made a plan to monitor for any deterioration and to discuss with the GP the following day. She was not escalated for investigations at the local hospital despite the size of the missing item and Tammy reporting feeling it inside her.
The Trust failed to have in place a formal policy relating to the management of the ingestion of foreign bodies. This meant that staff were not all working to a clear plan of how to monitor for, detect and respond to the medical complications of ingesting foreign bodies. The MDT failed to have in place a care plan specific to Tammy’s risk of swallowing, setting out how this should be managed and escalated by ward staff. There was no continuing, co-ordinated investigation to seek to locate the twistable crayon. On the evening of 16th May 2021 Tammy was observed to be vomiting in her toilet and at the same time reaching into the toilet. When asked, Tammy reported that she had swallowed a toothbrush. An out of grounds visit was arranged to take Tammy to Bassetlaw District General hospital. Tammy was examined at Bassetlaw General Hospital and was given an x-ray at 01:33am on 17th May 2021 which did not reveal any foreign bodies. Tammy was booked for an ultrasound scan later that day but was discharged at approximately 9:30am and returned to Rampton Hospital before this could be completed.
Staff seem to have taken the negative x-ray result as evidence that there were no foreign bodies in Tammy’s system. Many staff were unaware of the limitations of x-ray in relation to non-radiopaque items or the extent of the imaging.
On the evening of 4th June 2021 Tammy reported discomfort and anxiety due to constipation. Given the timing and symptoms we feel this is likely to be the beginning of Tammy’s deterioration. No actions beyond further observations are recorded to have taken place, staff appear to have taken Tammy’s constipation entirely at face value. There is no evidence that the twistable crayon was being considered at this point.
Tammy spent most of the day of 5th June 2021 in bed due to worsening symptoms. It is recorded that a mechanical restraint review was undertaken by the duty doctor, but it is unclear whether any physical examination of Tammy was undertaken at this point.
By the evening of 5th June Tammy’s temperature and heart rate had begun to spike and mental health staff became concerned. The same duty doctor was contacted during the evening by ward staff as Tammy continued to deteriorate. The duty doctor did not attend the ward or examine Tammy and advised ward staff to provide Tammy with paracetamol. This represents a missed opportunity to have recognised the deteriorating patient and to have sought medical attention.
There is no record at this point that Tammy’s symptoms were linked in any way to foreign body ingestion, despite Tammy voicing concern that she may have perforated her bowel. Tammy’s symptoms continued to worsen throughout the early hours of 6th June 2021, including high pulse rate and temperature, anxiety, abdominal pain and vomiting, escalating to projectile vomiting and apparent ‘faecal’ vomit.
The Hospital Trust failed to adhere to the NEWS2 Policy when Tammy was acutely unwell. NEWS2 was not recorded as frequently as required, at times the readings were incomplete, and the total score was not acted upon in accordance with the policy. This led to an underestimation of Tammy’s clinical risk, and multiple missed opportunities to have rendered care in an acute hospital which would probably have prevented her death
The physical healthcare team and the on-call Duty Doctor failed to recognise Tammy was a deteriorating patient and failed to take steps to arrange her timely transfer to an acute hospital for treatment of her perforated bowel.
Over the weekend of 5-6 June 2021 there was a breakdown in communication between the ward staff, physical healthcare staff, duty doctor, and site management as to Tammy’s signs and symptoms which led to a delay in her being transported to hospital to receive treatment for her condition
Tammy continued to deteriorate throughout the morning of 6th June 2021, until shortly after 2pm when Tammy’s symptoms were recognised by the physical healthcare team to be so severe that an ambulance would be required to take Tammy to hospital. A number of miscommunications between staff, added to the lack of a clear escalation protocol for staff to follow, resulted in a delay to the ambulance being called, because staff were unclear who should call the medical emergency.","During the course of the inquest I heard evidence giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Poor Quality Acute Physical Healthcare in the mental health setting
Tammy’s death demonstrates a further example of a failure by medical staff to recognise a deteriorating patient and a subsequent delay in escalating for acute secondary care intervention.
Her death comes after repeated concerns have been raised about the quality of the Trust’s physical healthcare service in secure settings since 2018 (when Angus Bowie died from sepsis due to a perforation), in 2019 (when Christopher Howard Smith died from a pulmonary embolus), in 2020 (when Alexander Braund died from a chest infection) and in 2021 (when Michelle Louise Whitehead died from Hyponatraemic Encephalopathy).
At each of those inquests, the Trust committed to improving the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings and yet the same poor quality has prevailed in Tammy’s care.
These are examples of preventable deaths and the similarity in themes across them is exceptionally worrying.
Action needs to be taken at the most senior level to effect meaningful change to the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings at which the Trust provides services, recognising this class of patients as exceptionally vulnerable to deterioration as they are unable, either through mental health challenges and/or incarceration, to access healthcare services of their own volition.
 
Failure to Adhere to the National and Local National Early Warning Score (version 2) Policy
This is a repeated theme identified at inquest and in previous Prevention of Future Death reports. Staff remained unclear at the inquest about how frequently vital signs ought to be taken, where and how to record the values, and what action should be taken depending on the score.
 
A lack of robust policy relating to Ingestion of Foreign Bodies
I heard evidence that the Trust is in the process of drafting a policy, but it became clear during evidence that the policy is not yet sufficiently robust.
The policy needs to cover the assessment of risk when access is permitted to risk items, where such a risk assessment is stored and who is responsible for its review of content, what to do when ingestion is
suspected including how this should be managed medically and what security measures need to be taken to locate the item.
 
4. Emergency Medical Calls
There was significant confusion in this case as to who should call a medical emergency and how information should be relayed to the ambulance service. It had been recognised early in the day by the Security Team that Tammy may require an out of grounds medical transfer, but it was not until much later in the afternoon, when Tammy was in cardiac arrest, that an ambulance was called. The Security Team expected the physical healthcare team to place the call, the physical healthcare team expected the ward to place the call due to proximity to the patient.
Evidence called at the inquest established continued confusion amongst staff as to how an emergency should be managed.
 
This appears to be a training issue.","On 13 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Tammy Mary Louise WATKINS, aged 36, which concluded by inquest held before me sitting with a Jury between 9 and 20 October 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 March 2024.

Her clinical condition was improving and it seemed as if the cancer had been fully removed but at the time of discharge her mobility remained significantly restricted. Anticoagulant prophylaxis stopped when she left the hospital and it is unclear if ongoing indication was considered. It is more likely than not that the lack of ongoing prophylaxis led to the formation of thrombosis in her left leg and her death due to pulmonary embolism.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
[BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN]
(1) The surgical mortality review conducted after Karena’s does not seem to have considered the role that anticoagulation may have played. I understand trust guidelines suggest it continues until 5-7 days or until the patient regains full mobility. I was told many surgeons will extend this to 28 days. Karena was past the 28 day period but still had significant restriction at the time of discharge. A few years ago I heard a very similar case which occurred at a different health trust. The purpose of this report is to suggest that discharge planning might have a prompt to consider possible ongoing anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients who leave the hospital but have not yet regained full mobility.","On 16 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karena WICKINGS.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
There was evidence that staff at Conway House were significantly concerned for Mr Cork’s welfare, which is why he was deemed as ‘at risk’. As a result of being ‘at risk’ I was told that welfare checks were required to be undertaken, at least every 24 hours. Such checks required a staff member to physically see and interact with Mr Cork or, in the alternative, to telephone him and speak to him. Welfare checks were then required to be recorded on a spreadsheet. Despite this, I was told in evidence that welfare checks would only be recorded if the resident in question was actually ‘seen’ by the staff member undertaking the check; this raises the concern that there is disparity about what constitutes a welfare check and what will or will not be recorded.
 
I heard evidence that prior to Mr Cork being found unresponsive in his room on 22 May 2023, the last recorded welfare check for Mr Cork was during the early shift of Saturday 20 May 2023. The concern here is that Mr Cork, despite being required to have welfare checks at least once every 24 hours, was not properly checked upon for between 36- 48 hours prior to his death.
 
A night project worker at Conway House told me in evidence that they had opened Mr Cork’s door at about 20:35 on Sunday 21 May 2023, but did not enter the room to see or assess Mr Cork. The only reason for opening the door appears to have been the arrival of the ‘EMS team’ who were required to check that Mr Cork was at home for the purposes of conditions imposed by the criminal justice system.
 
Having heard what they believed to be snoring, the staff member closed the door and left. This fact was verified by Metropolitan Police Officers who checked CCTV footage as part of their initial investigation following Mr Cork’s death. The concern here is that staff made assumptions that the ‘snoring’ noise was coming from Cork’s room and not an adjoining room, and that the noise was snoring, without investigating further. This was a missed opportunity to properly check on Mr Cork’s welfare, as required.
 
In evidence, I was taken through the spreadsheet that is used to record all checks and/or welfare checks required for any residents of Conway House. The record system appears to have been a basic Microsoft Excel spreadsheet devised by staff. I was told that the computer and/or spreadsheet often ‘crashed’, which led to data sometimes not being able to be recorded. I also observed that some fields of the spreadsheet were often left blank. Staff undertaking and recording checks regularly appeared not to input their name(s) or the time at which checks were undertaken. I was also told that while there was some training on how to undertake and record welfare checks, this was not needed because it was a simple task.
 
The concern here is that the recording system for welfare checks may not be adequate and that the approach taken to filling in the data required on the spreadsheet varied from one staff member to another, which may also indicate that there is a training need.
 
I was told in evidence that the same spreadsheet is still used to record any checks and/or welfare checks required for residents. I was told that the issues identified with a lack of checks for Mr Cork were caused by the fact that there were a significant number of agency staff on duty and that Conway House no longer uses agency staff. However, the staff member that opened Mr Cork’s door at 20:35 (without entering the room or seeing Mr Cork) on 21 May 2023 and subsequently found him unresponsive on the morning of 22 May 2023 was a substantive member of staff.
 
I was not reassured that any proper investigation into these issues had been undertaken or that any action(s) required to bring about improvements in the system of undertaking and recording welfare checks have been identified and/or implemented.","On 15 June 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of NICHOLAS CORK, then aged 57 years.

The [REDACTED] appears to provide step by step instruction on how to end your life using certain methods, including how to make the death appear to be due to natural causes and therefore avoid referral to the coroner. Whilst the introduction suggests it is aimed at those who are elderly and long-term suffering, there is also reference to suicide for other reasons within the book and is likely to appear to vulnerable mental health patients.

On Saturday 10th December 2022, Walter’s daughter visited his address and there was a Cranston’s shopping bag next to his chair. He said he had got the bus to Orton Grange (where the shop is) and back which raised alarm bells to his daughter. She asked him not to do this journey again as it is unsafe. Walter stated that he believes there is a pelican crossing to assist him crossing the road (A595). This is not the case at Orton Grange.
 
On Tuesday 13th December 2022, Walter has got the 400 bus at 16:10 hours from Wigton and got off at Orton Grange. Walter has forgotten his wallet and crossed the road to the middle island and continued onto the South-West carriageway. He then collided with a vehicle, causing him to fall into the chevrons in the middle of the road. At the time of the collision it was nearly dark and the road was busy with a steady flow of traffic in both directions moving at normal speed.

Her electricity meter (installed in 2001) was in a cupboard, just inside the communal door to the flats, some 7-8 feet off the ground.
 
Mrs Faulkner, was only 4’10” tall, and had no choice but to access the meter using a stepladder every time she wished to add credit to her pre-payment meter.
 
On 2 December 2022, Mrs Faulkner purchased credit for her electricity meter and then climbed the stepladder to put the credit onto the meter. In trying to access the meter she fell from the ladder and landed on the floor, where she was discovered some hours later by neighbours.
 
Mrs Faulkner sadly died in hospital on 8 December 2022, as a direct result of the injuries she sustained in the fall.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The electricity meter was installed at such a height that anyone wishing to access it would be unable to do so without the use of steps/a ladder. In addition, the placement of the meter (immediately behind an inwardly opening front door with no windows) added to the risk of using a stepladder because anyone coming through the door would be entirely unable to see anyone using a stepladder behind the door. Irrespective of the type of meter, it is reasonably foreseeable that electricity meters need to be accessed by people from time to time and not only those with the requisite training for working at height.
 
Siting prepayment meters, in particular, at such a height and location adds to the risk, because those choosing to use a pre-payment meter are required to access it each and every time they top-up the meter.
 
The electricity company which installed the meter in 2001 has “no records of what consideration they gave at the point of installation to the specific meter location.” Other meters in the property are at a similar height and it is not uncommon to find electricity meters at heights requiring steps to access them; there appears to be no industry standard requiring electricity meters to be easily accessible (albeit secure) by all potential customers, except perhaps in new build properties.","On 13 December 2022, an investigation was commenced into the death of BERNADETTE GRACE FAULKNER, then aged 80 years.

The evidence, in particular from the London Fire Brigade’s Fire Investigation Team, revealed that:
 
Mr Lee’s death was one of three in London in 2023 attributable to fire started by faulty lithium-ion batteries and/or chargers for e-bikes or e- scooters.

She had ischaemic and hypertensive heart disease and developed a large sacral sore with associated sepsis. These conditions precipitated congestive cardiac failure. She was admitted to Tameside General Hospital on 19th May 2023 where despite treatment, she died the same day of Sepsis with congestive cardiac failure.
 
The inquest heard that Mrs Roberts was supported by care agency carers four times per day and the District Nursing Team. Following a Tissue Viability assessment on 20th April 2023 the frequency of visits by the District Nursing team was increased to daily until Mrs Roberts was admitted to Tameside General Hospital on 19th May 2023.
 
The Inquest heard that the care agency raised concerns with Adult Social Care because her dressings were not being changed daily. In addition, Mrs Robert’s family raised concerns as did the hospital nurse responsible for Mrs Robert’s care on 19th May 2023. As a result, an investigation was opened by the District Nursing Service.
 
The Inquest heard that insufficient dressing changes for a sacral sore can lead to localised and systemic infection due to the risk of a sore in that area of the body being contaminated with urine and faeces.
 
The family were told on several occasions that the nursing team did not have time to change dressings. On 17th May 2023 a nurse did not attend to care for Mrs Roberts due to demands upon the District Nursing Team. The team offered instead an out of hours visit that would have disturbed Mrs Roberts and her family from sleep and so this was not accepted.
 
The Inquest heard that there are ongoing staffing issues within the District Nursing Team.
 
Following the Serious Incident Investigation, a number of measures have been undertaken by the Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust to address issues identified with the care of Mrs Roberts and with the district nursing service generally including:
 
Introduction of weekly compliance checks for Waterlow, MUST and body mapping policies.
All District Nursing Visits deferred to the out of hours service must be approved by Sister of Team leader.
 
However, the Inquest heard that despite a number of steps taken locally to manage the District Nursing Service such as using a variety of different staffing grades for visits, staffing shortages cannot be rectified by local action without a change of approach nationally.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The concerns raised were as follows:
 
Referral to Psychiatric Liaison Services for patients presenting with self-harm injuries and suicidal ideation (including those in Police custody) at Frimley Park Hospital A&E, including the extent to which the NICE guidance is complied with or provides effective guidance to staff in such circumstances.
The conduct of Mental Health Assessments in a custody setting by liaison and diversion staff including the adequacy of policy and guidelines relating to triggers to conduct such assessments and the manner in which refusals are dealt with.
The passage of information both between custody staff, as well as with healthcare staff in relation to concerns of a mental health nature for a detained person including the extent to which the custody record is used as an effective means to communicate concerns/observations of detained persons mental health.
The process of release of a vulnerable detained person following disposal, including interaction with family or other persons collecting the detained person.
 
I received further evidence in writing from the Interested Persons’ subsequent to the completion of the Inquest in relation to these concerns.
 
This evidence included responses from Hampshire Constabulary and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the failures identified during the course of the Inquest with respect to concerns at b – d (above). I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of these Interested Persons.
 
I also received evidence from the Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken in their area of responsibility to address my concern detailed at a (above). This evidence has not allayed my concern in relation to a (above).
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Evidence received from the police officers accompanying Mr. EVANS during his attendance at Frimley Park Hospital provided that:
 
a. Mr. EVANS presented with a large fresh cut on his arm and also cuts on his legs which were identified by him as being from self-harm with hospital staff noting that the larger mark on the arm might require stitching.
Police officers stated that Mr. EVANS was open with hospital staff about his feelings of self-harm depression, and thoughts of ending his own life. Officers further recalled that hospital staff noticed and commented on the self-harm marks on Mr. EVANS’ arms, including whilst staff were dressing a recent self- harm wound on Mr. EVANS’ left arm.
Officers also recalled Mr. EVANS commenting when offered food by hospital staff that he would rather starve to death.
One of the accompanying police officers expressed surprise at the fact that Mr. EVANS was not subject to a mental health referral or assessment, in the context of him commenting to multiple hospital staff members about his self-harm actions and ideation.
 
An emergency department consultant at Frimley Park gave evidence which suggested that no mental health assessment was or would have been necessary where Ryan’s presenting complaint was recorded as chest pains rather than of self- harm and/or suicidal ideation. Although self-harm had been noted in the records, no explanation could be provided for why Ryan’s suicidal ideation had not been recorded.
 
The consultant was further questioned in relation to the 2006 NICE Guidelines “Self-Harm: The short term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care” which are national guidelines that ought to feed into practice at the hospital.
 
These guidelines provide that “Following triage patients who have self-harmed should receive the requisite treatment for their physical condition, undergo risk and full psychosocial needs assessment and mental state examination, and referral for further treatment and care as necessary” and “All people who have self harmed should be offered an assessment of needs, which should be comprehensive and include evaluation of the social, psychological and motivational factors specific to the act of self-harm, current suicidal intent and hopelessness, as well as a full mental health and social needs assessment.”
 
Evidence received during the course of the Inquest was not able to reconcile the contradiction between the NICE guidelines on self-harm and Mr. EVANS having had no mental health assessment despite obvious signs of self-harm and further evidence of disclosure of suicidal ideation.
 
The jury in their Narrative Conclusion found that ‘Despite evidence of self-harm, no mental health assessment was carried out at this point.’
 
I remain concerned as to how such a situation would be avoided if a patient presented again in similar manner to Mr. EVANS. The additional evidence on PFD matters provided by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust does not refer to or address the NICE guidelines on self-harm or explain what would now be done differently were a patient such as Mr. EVANS were to be seen again.
 
The Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust additional evidence refers to matters being in the process of introduction and new referral criteria with Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, but this does not explain how this would prevent the future risk of a patient such as Mr. EVANS leaving the hospital without a mental health assessment.",On 4th April 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ryan John EVANS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23rd January 2023.

While in the care of the Emergency Department Mr HOLGATE sustained a fall. A CT scan showed evidence of a traumatic head injury, Mr HOLGATE was deemed very unwell and not for surgical intervention. Mr HOLGATE deteriorated further and another CT scan showed an ongoing bleed with mass shift which had not been evident on the original CT. Mr HOLGATE was reviewed again and still deemed not fit for intervention and placed on a palliative care pathway. Mr HOLGATE died on 1st November 2023.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
This matter was referred to this court and is a case where it is entirely suitable to proceed to inquest without the need for a post mortem examination.
Evidence regarding the cause of death will be provided at inquest by way of a statement from the treating clinician with the CT scans showing the sequence of events.
The family indicated that it had been Mr HOLGATE’s wishes, and indeed something that they supported, for his body to be donated for medical science/research.
This process has long been a way of researching illness and disease as well as assisting in the training of doctors. It is recognised as fundamentally important to progressing the understanding of medicine and treatment.
 
Each receiving medical research/training establishment have a criteria, one of which is that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, the deceased should not have undergone a post mortem examination. This is understandable, and exceptions allow in certain instances this to be waivered.
 
In Mr HOLGATE’s case the local medical research/training establishment had full capacity and were unable to accept him. As is normal the family/Coroners Officer were referred to an alternative establishment at Nottingham.
 
Nottingham politely declined, they indicated that they were prevented from accepting due to what appears to be an anomaly in the law. As the matter was subject of a coronial inquest they could not accept the donation.
 
In non-inquest matters reported to the coroner, where post mortem examination is not required and the coroner is content there is no requirement to investigate further, a form A is signed to indicate this and the coroner is then able to return the deceased back in to the care of their family/personal representative/funeral director to allow funeral arrangements or body donation to proceed. In these instances medical research/training establishments are able to accept donation.
 
Where a coroner is likely to hold an inquest in a situation where a post mortem is not necessary as a cause of death statement can be obtained and the coroner is content that there is no further need to retain the deceased for any further examination, the coroner must also ensure that the deceased is returned back to the care of the family/personal representative/funeral director as soon as practicable. This normally allows for funeral arrangements to proceed.
 
In both instances the coroner authorises release of the deceased, in majority of cases the person is cremated ie they will not be available nor required for the coroner, even when the matter is proceeding to inquest. All relevant enquiries have to be made and sufficient evidence obtained before the release is authorised.",,"In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.
 
This may be by way of clarification or guidance if S11 overrides the need to register before acceptance.
 
Donations of this kind further the advancement of medicine, treatments and training and as such prevent many deaths. It appears that those people who are subject of an inquest should not be prevented from donating their bodies when the coroner is content it is entirely appropriate to do so and it is the wishes of those making the arrangements.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 28th February 2024.

A member of staff was with him. On arrival he was triaged at 11:01 and assessed by a physician associate at 13:34. This was reviewed by the Emergency Medicine Consultant and a diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction was made based on the clinical assessment and x- ray of the abdomen which showed distended bowel loops. He was deemed stable and was referred to the nurse co-ordinator on the Surgical Assessment Unit (SAU) at 14:30. Evidence was provided at the inquest that the NELA (National emergency laparotomy audit) risk of death score was 2.3% at this time of referral.
 
Crucially no CT scan was undertaken which would have provided better resolution and information on the presenting condition. Evidence was given at the inquest that this would form basic medical treatment for an acute intestinal obstruction and consideration of an abdominal emergency laparotomy. Later under examination from the trust representative, the witness recanted slightly on this stating that more junior doctors may not be minded to seek a CT scan, and commented surprisingly that requesting a scan by a consultant in the Emergency department could not be guaranteed.
 
I received evidence in the form of the serious incident report that there were nursing shortages on that day and that the department was under considerable pressure. No surgical referral had been made. Concerns were raised that observations were not completed on time and I heard evidence from family members that their concerns about Karmchand and the pain he was suffering were not taken on board by staff. The SI report noted that there were difficulties in assessing his condition due to his mental health difficulties meaning that he could not express pain to staff as easily. His family and staff who knew him raised concerns, but adequate notice does not appear to have been taken..
 
At 20:30 Karmchand Deteriorated with decreasing level of consciousness and oxygen saturations and was escalated to the ED registrar and transferred to the resuscitation area where he was intubated and taken for CT scan at 22:00. The CT scan demonstrated dilated large bowel and a decision was taken for him to have urgent surgery
 
The delay in seeking a CT scan, which did not occur until that evening meant that surgery to treat the bowel distention only occurred much later into the evening and into the early morning of 24 September 2022. By this time, the NELA risk assessment had increased from 2.3% to 52% in other words, death was more likely to occur at that point of surgery than earlier in the day.
 
Mr Gulzar died during surgery in the early hours of 24 September 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Karmchand was referred to the surgical nursing team instead of the surgical registrar or surgical on-call team, as required by the Emergency Department to surgical registrar referral pathway from a previous SI where it had been identified as an issue. This was not followed in this case, leading to a delay in surgery and increased risk of death. I am concerned that the surgical registrar referral pathway is not being utilised despite previous incidents in which its use was highlighted as necessary.
 
No CT scan was undertaken as required by the acute abdominal pathway and guidance as part of the initial assessment. I was concerned by evidence that a CT scan would not be undertaken urgently as part of an acute abdominal presentation and that the necessity for a scan may not be known by junior (or some consultant) doctors.
 
The deterioration in Karmchand’s condition was not recognised due to difficulties in communication of pain due to his mental health condition. Concerns raised by his carers and family who knew him best and his presentation were not given adequate weight. A previous SI was reported to have raised this issue, but no action point or plan was provided in the current report to set out how staff could improve the assessment of patients with communication difficulties, by using observations and relying on people
who better knew their demeanour and presentation.","On 26 September 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death
of Karmchand GULZAR. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 December 2023. The findings and conclusion of the inquest were
 
Mr Karmchand Gulzar died at Sandwell hospital on 24 September 2022 during the course of an emergency operation to treat dilated large bowel. There had been a delay in obtaining a CT scan which showed the extent of the condition, meaning that the prospects of surviving surgery had reduced significantly by the time of the operation. Other warning signs of the significance of the surgical abdomen obstruction were not noted including a lactate level of 5 showing that Mr Gulzar was deteriorating. An immediate surgical review was not undertaken. These matters contributed more than minimally to Mr Gulzar’s death.
 
Natural Causes contributed to by neglect.

She sustained multiple injuries incompatible with life. At the time she was under the care of Oxleas NHS Trust Adults’ Community Mental Health Team. She believed she had early onset dementia which was being investigated. She had poor sleep and low mood in the months prior to her death but there was no formal diagnosis for her mental condition at the time of her death.","British Transport Police made a referral to the Older Adult Community Mental Health Team, Oxleas NHS Trust, on 25th January 2023, following an incident at Hither Green Station, when Mrs Porter had attempted to end her life by standing in front of an incoming train, which stopped.
 
The 9 page referral included information that Mrs Porter: “…made a deliberate act to jump onto the tracks in front of a train” and “Q: In your opinion, due to proximity of lethal means if it hadn’t been for certain actions would death or serious harm have occurred? A:Yes”. The summary of the incident on page 4, was only partially complete, in that it did not include the information that the train had stopped. It stated she: “decided to jump down on to the tracks to take her own life but then changed her mind and came back onto the platform”.
 
The inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report, prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust Staff relied on the summary of the incident, both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for example the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police).
 
The Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to Mrs Porter. Their Report stated: “Had the referral from BTP to OACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of the incident on 25 January 2023, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been  determined as high, and a more robust plan of care implemented to mitigate against these risks, that would have been immediately shared with her family”. It was established at Inquest that had the full details of the incident on 25th January 2023 been understood – ie that Denise intended to take her life and this was only prevented by the slowing and halting of the train – that the psychiatrist would have referred her either to the Intensive Home Treatment Team (with consent) or for a Mental Health Act assessment (if no consent had been forthcoming).
 
The Trust’s Report stated: “There were no identified service delivery issues that impacted on the services’ ability to offer care and treatment”. However, in oral evidence, the Trust’s witness agreed this was inaccurate, following reflection upon the missed opportunities of investigating the events of 25th January 2023.
 
The Trust was unable to provide the Inquest with information to satisfy my concern that the Trust has robust systems in place to avoid the risk that staff may rely upon short summaries from British Transport Police, rather than scrutinising all the information contained within a referral and making relevant inquiries if the reporting is ambiguous or incomplete.
 
In this case, the Trust was clearly of the view that the detail was significant but was overly reliant upon partial information which resulted in missed opportunities for appropriate referral.",On 23 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Denise Jane PORTER.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The evidence revealed that from at least 2019, Kimberly Liu had regularly accessed websites specifically aimed at selling prescription-only medications (predominantly medications with a sedative effect) that allowed repeat orders on the same day and did not require a prescription. Those websites included the following:
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
 
Despite the different URLs some of the websites appear to be operated by the same company and/or individual(s), in that ordering using an identical WhatsApp number ([REDACTED]) was also permitted.
 
Correspondence from the websites, following an order being placed, included messaging that suggested that the operator(s) knew that their supply of such medication was likely to arouse regulatory suspicion. By way of example, messaging received in emails following the placing of an order, included the following:
 
‘This is to inform you that usage of the name “Sleeping Tablets” during the payment at the banks is prohibited. Kindly do not use the brand name as it can be harmful for us.’
 
‘DO NOT MENTION THE PRODUCT OR WEBSITE WHEN MAKING PAYMENT.’
 
On one occasion in December 2021, the same website [REDACTED]
 permitted identical orders of [REDACTED] tablets within nine minutes of each other, without question or checks. Three days later a further order of
was again permitted without any query.
 
The concern here is that these websites, and potentially other similar websites, are not only operating without regulation, but that they appear to exploit already vulnerable individuals by facilitating an almost unseen feeding of dangerous medication addictions thereby placing those individuals in grave danger.
 
Although the inquest I heard did not concern a death by suicide, the additional concern is that these websites could also be seen to equip people with the means to complete suicide.
 
I believe that consideration ought to be given to the impact that the availability of such websites has on the population at large, together with the significantly increased risks to those who have developed an addiction to such medications or may even be contemplating acts of self-harm. I also believe that consideration ought to be given to whether and what action(s) could be taken to remove or limit access to or the availability of such websites.","On 17 February 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of KIMBERLY ANNA LIU, then aged 40 years.

Morgan-Rose Hart was detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act at the Derwent Centre on the female ward called Chelmer. Morgan-Rose had tied a ligature around her neck which resulted in a Cardiac Arrest and then Hypoxic Ischaemic Brain Injury. Morgan-Rose Hart was pronounced dead on the 12th July 2022 after brain stem testing confirmed Morgan-rose Hart had sustained Irreversible Brian Injury.
On 6th July 2022 events contributed to Morgan-Rose’s mental health deterioration. Morgan-Rose was not observed clinically since 14:06 and the time in between the last observation and when Morgan-Rose was discovered multiple failings occurred. These include non-clinical and clinical staff commenting on her appearance, a delivery of flowers triggering a response, observation Level 1 missed the following hour, as well as the consecutive hours observations also being incorrect and falsified. Other events during the day triggered an emotional response clinical staff reflecting unescorted leave and no therapeutic engagement was made to see if Morgan-Rose was okay.
After the delivery of the flowers incorrectly delivered to Morgan-Rose. Morgan- Rose attempted to contact relatives to clarify who these were from as there was some confusion as to who the flowers were for. The flowers were not meant for Morgan-Rose.
Whilst Morgan-Rose was in the bedroom multiple attempts were made to interact with the Oxevision system to check vital signs, although the system could not access this due to the tile being Amber stating that Morgan-Rose was in the bathroom.

Mr Campion was also known to drink alcohol to excess, described by family as a functioning alcoholic. On 1 July 2022 Mr Campion contacted the crisis teams indicated he was going to overdose and then proceeded to overdose on prescription medication. He was conveyed to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital where he was treated for the overdose and seen by the mental health team. A mental health assessment was not carried out and he was discharged with the advice to contact the crisis team if needed. On the evening of 20 July 2022 Mr Campion spoke to a friend who confirms Mr Campion appeared intoxicated but appeared to be his normal self. In the early hours of 21 July 2022, Mr Campion made contact with the Psychiatric Crisis Team threatening to take an overdose of [REDACTED] and his heart medication, he also stated that he had been drinking vodka. In the light of their concerns the Crisis Team contacted the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) by 999 at 2.10am. The initial call was allocated a category III classification (attendance within one hour and 90% of calls within two hours). The Service was stated to be very busy at that time. It was four and a half hours from the original call before the case was reviewed by a clinician but there does not appear to have been a welfare check phone call at that time. It was not until six hours after the initial call that an ambulance was allocated and when the crew arrived at his home address at 8:26am they found Mr Campion deceased in the living room. The post mortem and toxicology investigation found the cause of death to be mirtazapine and alcohol toxicity. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant medication and has a number of common side- effects including feeling sleepy and in overdose it can lead to reduced consciousness and coma. The TOXBASE guidance notes that peak plasma concentrations occur approximately two hours after ingestion. It also states that the effects on the central nervous system may be enhanced or prolonged following co-ingestion of other central nervous system depressants including alcohol. Though it is unknown as to exactly what time Mr Campion took the overdose of mirtazapine, in the opinion of the expert the delay of over 6 hours from the initial call to the ambulance service to an ambulance crew being allocated and arriving on scene is very significant. It is more likely than not if Mr Campion had been in hospital at a point at least two hours after ingestion he would have survived this event. There were a number of missed opportunities in the care and treatment of Mr Campion. The family contact details noted by the mental health team were incorrect. There was very little evidence of family involvement throughout the mental health interactions, this being a critical and crucial element of the mental heath treatment plan. On 1 July 2022 a full mental health assessment should have been carried out, which is likely to have resulted in immediate support for Mr Campion and measures been put in place for further referrals to the appropriate mental health services. On 21 July 2022 the ambulance call handler did not give the time estimate of the ambulance to the crisis team member; that said the numbers for the family were incorrect and so would not have led to anyone being contacted. The delay in the ambulance dispatch prevented Mr Campion receiving medical treatment and further psychiatric assistance. The outcome for Mr Campion has been adversely impacted due to the  demand on the ambulance service . At the time of the 999 call on 21st July 2022 NWAS were operating at Level 4 of the Plan (PSP) experiencing high demand, acute pressures and high numbers of waiting calls. The options for the emergency services were extremely limited and an ambulance was deployed at the earliest opportunity. Mr Campion clearly consumed an excessive amount of prescription medication whilst under the influence of alcohol and as such his state of mind is likely to have been impaired. Taking account of his past actions, particularly that of 1st July 2022, it is more likely than not he carried out the act not with the intention of taking his own life.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The delay in triaging the call made by Mr Campion threatening to take an overdose resulted in him taking the overdose. The delay in the ambulance dispatch prevented Mr Campion receiving medical treatment and further psychiatric assistance. The outcome for Mr Campion has been adversely impacted due to the demand on the ambulance service . At the time of the 999 call on 21st July 2022 NWAS were operating at Level 4 of the Plan (PSP) experiencing high demand, acute pressures and high numbers of waiting calls. The options for the emergency services were extremely limited and an ambulance was deployed at the earliest opportunity. Consideration be given to how to support the Ambulance and Mental Health Services in fulfilling the NHS long-term plan for Mental Health, in particular Mental Health Practitioners in Ambulance control rooms.",On 02 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of James CAMPION aged 57. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 19 December 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 13, 2024.

Mr Parks was moved to the resuscitation area of the department and an interfacility transfer request to the Northern General Hospital’s primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) centre was made by a nurse at the hospital to Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS).   It was confirmed by YAS that the category 2 blue light ambulance was booked at 3.06am on 13 December 2022, the ambulance should have taken at the latest 40 minutes to arrive, YAS confirmed the ambulance was categorised correctly as a category 2.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The ambulance response time of 3 hours and 18 minutes has likely affected the outcome.
 
There were insufficient Emergency Medical Dispatcher’s available to meet the forecasted demand. Staffing at YAS was below the requirement to meet the expected demand.
 
There was a significant delay in offloading patients at hospitals, which tied up resources and meant they were unable to respond to emergency calls.","On 25 May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shaun PARKS.

He was advised that the additional cost of histological analysis of the excised samples would be c.£65 and so decided not to have the samples sent for analysis. When the lesion continued to trouble him in May 2020, he returned to his GP who referred him to dermatology, where a further excision was performed and analysed and was found to be melanoma. An ultrasound scan showed that the melanoma had metastisised to his lymph nodes, chest wall and lungs. Despite immunotherapy and targeted oral therapy, the melanoma continued to metastasise and in June 2022, scans showed that it had spread to Gregor’s brain such that his condition was terminal. He was placed onto a palliative care pathway and following an admission to Addenbrooke’s hospital on 6 July 2022, he died on 8 July 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
I was not able to conclude that, had the sample been sent for analysis in March 2019, any sign of melanoma would have been detected. Nevertheless, it is of concern that the barrier to undergoing a complete procedure, including histological analysis, appears to be one of cost. Anecdotal evidence received at inquest from treating clinicians was that the further costs associated with histological or other review, which on the NHS would be routinely included within the procedure at no charge to the patient, was a common disincentive to patients who would regularly opt not to have the further tests carried out.
While it is acknowledged that there have to be criteria for routine and non-emergency procedures to be conducted on the NHS, my concern relates to the disparity in what is included within the treatment when undertaken privately (where histological analysis is a separate and additional cost) and what is routinely included as part of NHS treatment
It therefore seems to me that there is a risk of future deaths if patients not meeting the NHS referral criteria, who have to pay for procedures to be carried out privately, opt on cost grounds not to have the histological analysis which would otherwise be provided on the NHS at no charge, as it is well-established fact that earlier detection and treatment is crucial in minimising the risks of developing metastatic cancers including melanoma.","On 29 July 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Gregor Patrick Edward Lynn aged 24 years.

Due to vegetation growth of trees and bushes on the verge of the public highway, the tractor driver’s line of sight was obstructed, making it impossible to assess whether there was adequate time and distance to safely exit the junction. Consequently, the motorbike’s path was blocked by the trailer and the rider could not take evasive action in time to avoid the collision. Mrs Constable was thrown from the motorbike in the collision, sustaining multiple injuries and she was pronounced deceased at 1150 hours.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
In the course of evidence from the local authority’s highway maintenance manager, I heard concerning testimony as to the apparent lack of systems and processes in place to record complaints or reports of hazards or defects with the highway. Consequently, there seemed to be no way of identifying which reports had been actioned or inspected and even when the system indicated that an inspection had taken place and led to a recommendation for work to be carried out within a statutory timeframe, there was no information available on the system to show if or when any work was carried out, much less to what specification.","On 10 August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joanne Comstable aged 52 years.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
A thematic review completed in November 2021 had identified a number of significant issues in the functioning of mental health services, and many of the same issues were also identified in the serious incident review into Linda’s care and treatment, from February 2022 until her death. It is apparent that any actions taken as a result of the thematic review were not effective in implementing change and that the action plan was still a “work in progress” at the Pre Hearing Review Hearings which took place in this case in 2023.
The Serious Incident Investigation into the care received by Linda was not completed until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after the death. This is neither timely nor responsive. Despite reassurances given that the Trust are working to eradicate such delays, in response to a series of previous PFD reports issued by the Coroners of Durham and Darlington, there are still cases coming to the attention of the Coronial service where Serious Incident Investigations are significantly delayed in excess of the 60 day NHS framework.
As previously reported the concern in relation to the delays in such investigations and any subsequent necessary action required, is twofold. Firstly, the quality of the investigation is severely compromised as the evidence is not captured when memories are fresh. Secondly, because any lessons to be learnt and improvements to be made to improve patient safety cannot be implemented promptly.","On the 19th of April 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Linda Louise Banks, aged 48 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18th of December 2023. The medical cause of death was 1a) Paracetamol overdose with alcohol misuse. I gave a narrative conclusion as follows:-
 
Linda Louise Banks died on the 10th of April 2022 at the University Hospital of North Durham. Linda had a history of alcohol misuse and mental health difficulties, including self harm and suicidal ideation. Linda also had learning difficulties which may have increased her vulnerability, which were not identified by vast majority of the mental health professionals, and there is no evidence that consideration was given to any reasonable adjustments that might be necessary, or as to any impact such may have had on her presentation, communication and understanding.
 
Linda herself, her family and her friends, made multiple contacts with mental health services between February 2022 and her death, as her mental health deteriorated and concerns were expressed as to her safety. Referrals were also made by two external agencies, namely her GP and a home support agency, both expressing concerns about Linda’s presentation. On each occasion risks were considered to be minimal and no further treatment or care was provided by mental health services.
 
There were a multiplicity of difficulties revealed by a serious incident review which was extensively delayed and not received until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after Linda’s death. It concludes that Linda did not receive the right care at the right time and her needs were not fully met, and included concerns, in summary, in relation to the quality of assessments and triage, quality of safety planning, poor record keeping, and further considers that there was an underestimation of risk and a lack of a trauma informed approach. I also find that these difficulties culminated in advice being given to a friend attempting to support Linda and communicated to her family, from an unknown mental health worker, that they should consider “tough love” and to effectively step back from their intensive support of Linda, thus removing an essential safety net in the absence of any ongoing mental health treatment or support. The identified failings cumulatively contributed to the death more than minimally.
 
An earlier thematic review which had been completed in November 2021 identified many similar serious issues in the provision of mental health services, to those identified in this case, and it is clear that many of these issues were continuing at the time of Linda’s death in April of 2022 and had not been addressed effectively by the Trust.
 
On the 9th April 2022 Police forced entry to Linda’s home, as a result of concerns raised by her family and friends and was taken to hospital by ambulance. She was hyperthermic and had low blood sugar and had taken an overdose of medication. Despite attempts to treat her she died in hospital on the 10th April 2022 as a result of the acute complications of paracetamol overdose on a background of alcohol related liver disease",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23.2.24 .

She consulted with orthopaedic surgeons and it was decided that surgery would be appropriate to maintain her levels of independence. She underwent surgery on the 13 October 2022 and the orthopaedic outcome was satisfactory. Post-operatively, Mrs Waylett’s recovery was complicated by ongoing low blood pressure and intermittent oxygen requirements. From the early hours of 17 October 2022, she required a medical assessment, with medical intervention to address a likely pulmonary oedema and likely urinary tract infection. She did not receive the necessary medical intervention and on the 19 October 2022, she suffered a cardiac arrest on the ward. Resuscitation was provided and she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Sadly, she did not recover and she passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital in the early hours of the 20 October 2022. Had Mrs Waylett received the necessary medical intervention from the 17 October 2022 or even on the morning of the 19 October 2022, it is likely that her death would have been avoided.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Any learning from the Health Board’s Investigation Report is not adequately shared with its practitioners;
A part of the Health Board’s Investigation Report changed in different versions and obscured the reason why the provision of blood products was delayed meaning issues are not sufficiently identified and actioned;

There was no clear cause or diagnosis for the seizures but it was felt that he was suffering from electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. In November 2022 a decision was made to commence him on high dose steroids, a known consequence of which was immunosuppression. He developed signs of chicken pox on Friday 17 February 2023 and was brought to his community paediatric appointment on 20 February 2023 but not seen and assessed as he was known to have a contagious disease. He was seen later that day by a nurse at his general practitioner surgery and was seen and sent home. A later discussion between a general practitioner at the surgery and the community paediatrician led to a referral to the paediatric assessment unit at Ipswich hospital. The unit was busy and an appointment was not made until the following morning. By 11am on 21 February 2023 Nuel had deteriorated further and his parents had to support and carry him to the paediatric assessment unit arriving at 11.05am. Observations taken at 11.30am revealed he was pyrexial, tachycardic and tachypnoeic but the sepsis pathway was not followed. He was prescribed paracetamol at 12.15 and seen by a paediatric registrar who did not consider the sepsis protocol should be initiated as there was a clear cause for his symptoms i.e chicken pox. The plan was made to observe him, recheck his observations and if he had improved to send him home with oral Acyclovir. At 13.20 he remained pyrexial and tachycardic and his respiratory rate was still high at 32 and he was prescribed Ibuprofen. By 15.30 his temperature had come down and his heart rate had settled but was still high at 118, as was his respiratory rate at 29. He was also unable to mobilise having previously not being limited with his mobility. He was confused but this was considered to be his usual presentation due to his neurodegenerative condition. The doctor who planned to discharge him did not discuss him with a Consultant and was not aware he needed a wheelchair to leave hospital having had no issues with his mobility prior to the onset of his current viral illness.
He was taken home by his parents and was unable to swallow his oral medication and took very little by way of fluids. He deteriorated the following day and collapsed shortly before 2pm. His parents called emergency services and police and paramedics attended. Despite attempts at resuscitation including in the emergency department at West Suffolk hospital he died later that afternoon. A post mortem revealed he had died as a consequence of Varicella Zoster.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
During the course of my investigation into the death of Nuel-Junior I instructed an independent paediatric expert to review his management and opine on causation. During the course of hearing the evidence from the expert and all of the treating clinicians it became clear that there was some potentially relevant guidance available but it lacked clarity. Here intravenous Acylovir, if prescribed, may have prevented Nuel-Junior’s death but he was instead prescribed oral Acyclovir which was unlikely to have made a difference.

She remained at UCLH until her death on 23 June 2023.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
There was a ten day delay in Ms Chappell’s transfer from the Princess Royal Hospital to UCLH. I was told that this might have been because of a lack of beds, but it might also have been because of confusion about which UCLH site was the accepting surgeon’s preferred destination, a confusion that was understood at the time by the Princess Royal to be a rejection of the transfer.
 
From at least 16 June 2023, the consultant urology surgeon in charge of Ms Chappell’s care was very firmly of the view that he was not the best clinician to fulfil this role. He had long since correctly determined that she had not sustained a ruptured bladder, and thus considered that her care belonged with the gastroenterologists or the general surgeons.
 
Despite the agreement on 16 June of the gastroenterology clinical director that Ms Chappell’s care should be led by the gastroenterologists, they had not taken over her care by the time of her death, and there had not even been a conversation between the gastroenterology and general surgery consultants about the transfer of care.
 
There was a frequent misunderstanding among the medical staff that Ms Chappell’s issues were all chronic. Her acute situation was often not properly handed over or understood by her consultants.","On 4 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sarah Chappell, aged 43 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today. I made a determination as follows.   ","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 February 2024.

He had spent most of his adult life in psychiatric hospital and had a recent history of self harm in that he had attempted to hang himself [REDACTED] on 20th May 2020 before finally succeeding in carrying out the exact same act on 31st July 2020 which this time resulted in his death. Mr Perrott was on 15 minute observations at the time of his death but these were not recorded and no one noticed he was missing until 15 minutes after his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Despite the Trust having prepared a detailed report and addendum for my consideration after the inquest I am still concerned about the following :
Paul Perrott’s observations charts were not filled out adequately or at all on the date of his death
There appeared to be a lack of clarity over who was responsible for checking the observation charts ,when they would be checked by staff over the course of a working day and who would regularly feed back to staff if there was a problem in this respect .
At least one member of staff was unaware that Paul had described himself to staff in May 2020 as looking for an opportunity to take his own life if it arose and that Paul had attempted to take his own life less than 3 months previously in exactly the same way as on 31st July 2020.
(4 ) Although certain changes to policy and procedures were described to me there still seems to be a focus on risk in the “here and now “which does not
include an analysis of historical and contextual risks","On 7th August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Paul Perrott , age 34 The investigation concluded at the end of a jury inquest on 17th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide but the jury answered a number of questions which raised concern over the level of observations and care given to Paul during his time on Ashcombe Ward.","Although there have already been changes made to polices and procedures in the hospital arising out of this death action should be taken:
– To review the procedures in place on the wards to ensure that observation charts are regularly checked by ward management and concerns feedback to staff quickly and appropriately
– To ensure that staff members are required and able to easily familiarise themselves with the full history in relation to each patient they care for as opposed to simply being made aware of any risks that present on the day which may not take account of historical or contextual risk .
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5th February 2024 .

Ian fell so that he landed in front of the toilet block in the car park, suffering very serious injuries. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted at the scene by lifeguards and off duty doctors, before being conveyed to RCHT by ambulance. Ian was examined at hospital and found to have sustained multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs.
 
On 4 June 2022, Ian was transferred to Derriford Hospital for treatment of complex spinal fractures, under the neurosurgical team.
 
On 5 June 2022 Ian suffered a medical episode which developed into a critical incident in which Ian deteriorated rapidly and required life saving measures.
 
On 6 June 2022 Ian was taken to theatre for spinal surgery. Before surgery, the critical care flexible endotracheal tube was replaced by an armoured tube. After surgery, the anaesthetic team commenced an airway exchange, namely removing the armoured tube which had been inserted for the operation, in order to replace it with the more flexible critical care tube. However, having removed the armoured tube, the team were unable to insert the flexible tube despite repeated attempts. Ian then started to desaturate due to lack of oxygen. The Consultant Anaesthetist proceeded to jet ventilate Ian, the first jet was uneventful, the second resulted in massive neck swelling, Ian went into cardiac arrest. The medical team then resorted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency tracheostomy. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 20-25 minutes During this time Ian suffered hypoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen.
 
Over the following days, Ian suffered seizures on the intensive care unit and an MRI on 9 June 2022 showed extensive changes consistent with hypoxic brain injury.
 
On 15 June 2022, Ian’s care was transitioned to end–of-life care.
 
Ian died in the intensive care unit at Derriford hospital at 17:10 on 15 June 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
There was an error of omission in record keeping and in handover from critical care to surgery, and that this error likely contributed to Ian’s death.
There was no entry in Ian’s hospital notes to indicate the full extent of the critical incident of 5 June 2022.
There was a lack of information on handover from critical care to the surgical team regarding the full extent of the critical incident of the 5 June 2022. There was a verbal handover which was brief and vague. There was no formal written handover process highlighting significant events.
The error of omission was unexplained and has not been investigated by the NHS. The evidence regarding the error of omission came to light after the completion of the NHS investigation into Ian’s death. The Consultant Anaesthetist involved in Ian’s operation discovered the fact of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 on a later examination of ventilator data. The data indicated that Ian deteriorated significantly, that he was close to a cardiac arrest and the critical care team saved his life.
The surgical and anaesthetic team had no reason to suspect a secondary brain injury. The team had no information on Ian’s neurological status. Ian is likely to have suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the critical incident of 5th June. This will have undermined his resilience and ability to physically withstand the rigors of spinal surgery and airway exchange.
Had the surgical and anaesthetic team known of the extent of the critical incident of 5 June, the operation would have been delayed and further tests and assessments undertaken. The anaesthetic team may have opted for elective tracheostomy if the full circumstances of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 had been known. An elective tracheostomy would have led to
a different outcome because it would have avoided the complications that ensued from the attempted airway exchange.
I note the NHS Investigator and the Investigatory Panel both recommended that action is required for the handover of complex patients. The panel recommended as follows:
More robust and formalised handover of complex patients before transfer to theatre, to include review of airway management, cardiopulmonary status, potential avenues of deterioration and any significant events during admission
The Trust had chosen not to accept this recommendation but at the time the Trust made that decision it was not aware of the extent and significance of the error of omission.",On 7 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of 51 year old Ian Jacka.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1. The inquest heard that there are very long waiting lists for GID clinics. In September 2023, the average waiting time was in the region of 7 years. The expert instructed at the inquest identified that long waiting lists could intensify distress arising from gender dysphoria.
2. The inquest also heard that there is little local support available to patients who are waiting for assessment and treatment by Gender Identity Clinics .
3. There was a lack of clarity as to who is responsible for the wellbeing of the patient during the waiting period, for any distress caused by the gender dysphoria. There was a lack of consensus as to whether it would be the referrer or the GID clinic itself .
4. Local mental health services have very little specialist knowledge as to how best to support a person suffering from GID.
5. Those in attendance at the inquest were unclear about guidance available to GPs and other healthcare professionals to support them with the safe prescribing of bridging hormones, during the lengthy waiting period. The BMA’s guidance on the role of GPs in managing patients with gender incongruence (2022) and the Royal College of Psychiatrist’s advice relating to bridging prescriptions was not known by the healthcare professionals in attendance at the inquest hearing.

Mrs Aston remained very unwell post-operatively and died on the 18 October 2021 at 12:40hrs.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Pre-amble
 
The inquest heard evidence to confirm that Mrs Aston appropriately underwent a total gastrectomy at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust on 29 September 2021. There are no concerns about the surgery, care provided at or discharge from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.
 
The inquest heard that on 15 October 2021, whilst at her home, Mrs Aston began to experience pain in her abdomen. The pain became progressively worse and 999 was called. East Midlands Ambulance Service attended. The court heard evidence that, on the balance of probabilities, the worsening pain was likely to be the start of a splenic rupture.
 
On 15 October 2021 at 15:31hrs Mrs Aston arrived at Kettering General Hospital, having been transported there by emergency ambulance. The inquest heard that Mrs Aston was “in extremis” on arrival at Kettering General Hospital which is perhaps the most unwell anyone can be. Mrs Aston needed life-saving surgery to stop her bleeding internally.
 
The inquest heard that Mrs Aston should have been categorised as a high-risk “life or limb” Category 1 patient when she arrived at Kettering. As a Category 1 patient Mrs Aston should have been operated on within an hour of her arrival to stop the bleeding, however, instead of undergoing surgery she was placed on the ICU at Kettering where she remained for almost 24 hours, until the afternoon of 16 October 2023, when she was transferred to the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.
 
On 16 October 2021 at 16:00hrs Mrs Aston arrived at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. Ten minutes later, at 16:10hrs Mrs Aston was in theatre undergoing a splenectomy.
 
Mrs Aston remained very unwell post-operatively and on 18 October 2021, after discussions with her family, the decision to palliate her was taken, Mrs Aston died at 12:40hrs at the Leicester Royal Infirmary.
 
The decision making at Kettering
 
The inquest heard evidence to confirm that the decision making as to whether a patient is operated on or not is entirely the remit of the surgical team at Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust.
 
The evidence around why the decision not to operate on Mrs Aston at Kettering was taken that night is confused. Lack of theatre capacity at Kettering was often cited as one of the reasons and the possible complexity of the surgery required being cited as another.
 
The On Call Consultant Surgeon who made the decisions relating to Mrs Aston at Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust on 15 and 16 October 2021 did not attend the inquest as he now lives abroad so was unable to provide clarity around his decision making.
 
The inquest heard the following evidence about the splenectomy surgery that Mrs Aston needed that night:
 
It is possible to undertake a splenectomy at Kettering General Hospital;
Undertaking a splenectomy was something that the On Call General Surgeon at Kettering General Hospital that night was capable of (further, even if the surgeon had reservations about the possible complexity of the surgery a highly experienced surgeon from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust had offered to drive to Kettering to perform the surgery or assist with it, unfortunately despite his repeated offers of assistance he was told there was no theatre space available at Kettering);
No emergency surgeries were undertaken at Kettering General Hospital on the night in question and therefore there was theatre capacity at Kettering General Hospital on 15 October 2021 into 16 October 2021 for Mrs Aston to have had her surgery.
 
Concerns
 
Surgical decision making – I am concerned about the fact that the decision about whether to operate on a patient or not lies with one single surgeon with seemingly no checks or balances around their decision making. It concerns me that all of the witnesses at the inquest agreed that Mrs Aston needed immediate life-saving surgery when she presented to Kettering General Hospital yet there was no challenge to the decisions made by the on-call surgeon not to operate.
 
Trust investigations into Mrs Aston’s care – I am gravely concerned about the seeming inadequacies in the investigation and/or incident reporting processes at Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust. The inquest was advised that a DATIX incident report was not raised in relation to Mrs Aston’s care or death.
 
I am concerned about the fact that Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust did not look into the care provided to Mrs Aston until such time as the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust contacted them about the inquest.
 
I am further concerned about the fact that when Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust did look into the care provided to Mrs Aston they did so on the assumption that the clinical decision making had been appropriate, this makes the exploration of the care provided somewhat otiose.
 
The Trust’s exploration of the care provided to Mrs Aston failed to identify the fact that surgery should have been undertaken within an hour and the fact that, despite some of the assertions to the contrary, it would have been appropriate and possible to undertake that life-saving surgery at Kettering General Hospital.
 
The failure to properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where the Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust were alerted for the first time to the questionable clinical decision making and the potential errors in care at the inquest, which took place some 24 months after death (due to witness availability).
 
I am concerned that the lack of robust critical analysis and investigation of the clinical decision making and care provided to Mrs Aston at Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust before her death has caused a delay to, and led to missed opportunities to learn lessons that are vital to patient safety.
 
My concerns relating to the inadequacy of the Trust’s exploration of the care provided to Mrs Aston and the risks related to that go far beyond just the care provided by the Surgical Team at Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust. The risks have the ability to prevent learning, therefore negatively impact upon patient safety, across the entire Trust.","On 21 October 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lindy Lyanne ASTON aged 67.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The evidence I heard was that a Joint Operating Protocol between the North West Ambulance Service and the five regional police forces designed to address the issues of which emergency service should take responsibility for incidents involving drug overdoses and the method by which the police officers attending such incidents prior to the arrival of the ambulance service can escalate their concerns over a person suspected to have taken a drug overdose, was in an advanced stage of completion, but was stalled in July 2022.
 
Whilst I heard that discussions have recently recommenced, they now encompass the Right Care, Right Person model, the findings of the Manchester Arena Bombing Enquiry and that additionally, the Fire and Rescue Service and the British Transport Police have now become involved.
 
Pending agreement of a Joint Operating Protocol, there does not appear to be any consistent and reliable understanding in place across the police forces and the North West Ambulance Service to provide clarity as to the roles of the respective services and the method by which concerns about individual patients can be escalated to the ambulance service by police officers dealing with those who are suspected to have taken drug overdoses.","On 29th November 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Claire Nicole Briggs, aged 42 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12th July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that she died of a propranolol overdose on 28th November 2022 at Stepping Hill Hospital, Stockport, having taken approximately [REDACTED] propranolol tablets from previous prescriptions. She declined to be taken to hospital by the police for the critical time period after she had taken the tablets. There were 2 admitted failings by the North West Ambulance Service effectively to conduct clinical reviews of the incident which were not in themselves causative of her death, but the combined effect of those failings, the absence of any method within the NHS Pathways system to identify high risk overdoses and the pressures on the deployment of ambulances on that day combined to lead to a delay in her arrival at hospital which possibly contributed to her death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2nd February 2024.

[REDACTED].  She had taken [RED CTED] modified release tablets.
Equivalent to 56 days’ worth of this prescribed medication.
 
She was taken to Derriford Hospital by ambulance in the early hours of 16 May 2021 where she was reviewed in the emergency department and then shortly afterwards admitted to ICU.
 
On arrival at the emergency department, Katie was recognised to be extremely unwell. She was unconscious with a GCS of 3 as a result of her overdose. She had also had a number of seizures on her way to the hospital, and prior to the ambulance arrival. She required intubation and ventilation to protect her airway and stabilise her condition.
 
A chest x-ray was undertaken which demonstrated evidence of an aspiration. Katie also had a temperature of 40°c on admission to the emergency department; this, and the evidence of early muscle injury, led the treating ICU team to conclude that Kate was likely to be suffering with serotonin toxicity.
 
Given the ongoing risk of serotonin toxicity, and following Toxbase advice, no infusion of the opiate drug [REDACTED was administered to Katie during days 1, 2 or 3 of her ICU admission. At this stage, the venlafaxine was felt to still to be her system, and the plan was to support Katie whilst this cleared, and to treat her evolving aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. Where additional sedation was required remifentanil was used.
 
On day 4 of Katie‘s ICU admission (19 May 2021) a decision was made to switch the remifentanil infusion to a [REDACTED] infusion as per usual ICU practice. In the following days Katie‘s kidney function continue to normalise. There was no recurrence of a hyperpyrexia, or any other clinical features to suggest a recurrence of the serotonin syndrome.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The administration of [REDACTED] from day four of Katie’s hospital admission reprecipitated her serotonin syndrome and directly contributed to her death. The Trust has recognised this and amended its sedation policy to recommend “lower risk” opiates (such as morphine) are used in patients who have taken overdoses of medications where there is a risk of serotonin syndrome / toxicity.
 
It is accepted that the way the [REDACTED] interacted in this case was unexpected, and appears to have occurred due to the particular circumstances of Katie’s case; in particular an aspiration pneumonia requiring treatment in the prone position, and the development of a paralytic ileus. However, these complications are not unusual in patients who have taken overdoses of these types of medications and as such I consider there is a risk a future death may occur in similar circumstances.
 
I am concerned that other NHS organisations may not fully appreciate the risks associated with the use of [REDACTED] in patients such as Katie and that this information should be shared with those organisations on a national level.","On 11 June 2021 an inquest was opened touching the death of Katie Anne WILLIAMS (aged 45) who died at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth on 24 May 2021. She died having taken intentional overdose of [REDACTED] on 15 May 2021, and as a result of subsequent hospital care and treatment provided to her for that overdose and associated complications.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 January 2024.

William’s care and treatment was sub-optimal; his asthma was poorly controlled in the absence of appropriate assessment and reviews. William required chest compressions and intramuscular adrenalin in accordance with the Joint Royal Colleges Ambulances Liaison Committee (JRCALC) Guidelines with oxygen for a life-threatening asthma attack on 27 October 2020 that saved his life. William was conveyed to Southend Hospital where he was discharged home four hours later with no assessment of his recent symptomatology and no change to his medications. Family contacted the GP service for advice and chased a referral to the asthma and allergy services. No changes were made to William’s medication until 4 November 2020 when he was prescribed a steroid preventer inhaler at the request of the asthma nurse and follow-up with Southend Hospital. William was lost to follow-up at Southend Hospital following a consultant appointment on 14 November 2020. The Asthma and Allergy Service comprised of telephone calls of no more than five minutes with no contact after 1 February 2021 until 21 May. The GP prescribed four short doses of oral steroids for exacerbations of his asthma in December 2020, February, April and 19 May 2021 that were insufficient to effectively manage obviously poorly controlled asthma in a picture of vastly excessive reliever inhaler prescriptions and the absence ongoing of preventer medication.
On 21 May 2021 the asthma nurse did not review or escalate the increased salbutamol inhaler use information shared. The advanced GP nurse practitioner reviewed William’s condition on 25 May 2021 at the request of the GP following the final prescription of steroids and confirmed that William’s asthma remained very poorly controlled but failed to escalate concerns. As a consequence of multiple failures, William suffered an inevitable life-threatening asthma attack on the night of 29 May 2021 and crew arrived at approximately 00:18. Ambulance Crew could not secure William’s airway when he went into respiratory arrest with a missed opportunity by ambulance crew to administer intramuscular adrenalin in the presence of a strong pulse that probably would have delayed the cardiac arrest and possibly saved his life. William went into cardiac arrest at approximately 00:35 with further crew on scene and chest compressions commenced.
Intravenous adrenalin was administered at approximately 00:45 when William was in the ambulance and resuscitation continued until HEMS met the ambulance en-route to hospital. The HEMS doctor inserted an endotracheal tube and administered medications and William was conveyed to hospital. William had sustained a brain injury not compatible with life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Following her discharge from hospital, this psychology treatment effectively came to an end, since the procedures for receiving this treatment in the community were passed to an entirely separate set of clinicians. There was an entirely separate procedure for referral and provision of psychology sessions, with a very significant wait, and the deceased never in fact secured access to those services in the months between being discharged (in May 2022) and her death in October 2022.

She was found suspended [REDACTED]. The evidence indicted that she had secured the ligature herself before lowering herself into it. The evidence established that she had died at some point in the early hours of the morning – it was known that she was not sleeping. There were no suspicious circumstances concerning the death. The Deceased was diagnosed with EUPD and ADHD and was receiving therapy and support from the community mental health team and from her GP in respect of physical pain. She had been struggling in the months prior to her death with emotional dysregulation, reflective of her EUPD but influenced in part by a programme of gradual reduction in her medications, which she had requested. The evidence was not able to establish that the change in her medication had chemically caused an instability in her emotions (and it was recognised that both the long term and concomitant use of her various prescription medications were clinically indicated and without contra-indications). However, the psychological impact of reduction, coupled with increasing social stressors and an increasingly subjective feeling of isolation, abandonment and lack of being heard in the last few weeks of her life are believed to have all contributed to an increasing internal narrative which led, on the evening of 24 June 2022, and without warning, to a spontaneous and impulsive act against an increasing background of emotional dysregulation. There was no evidence to indicate that her death had been an accident or a cry of help (given the timing and nature of the act). In the context of her complex diagnosed conditions however, the risk of dangerous and impulsive acts with impulsive intent was recognised, but not in all the circumstances expected.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. It was recognised in evidence and in submission to the Court by representatives of the Trust, that there is and remains a fragmented relationship between mental health and physical health services, with little inter-service connectivity. It was recognised that ideally services for those with both mental and physical health diagnoses should be connecting in a seamless, timely and collaborative manner – specifically through the joint commissioning of services, to support patients of all ages.
 
Nationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and by the ICB – Project Fusion I understand is such an example – much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients.
 
It was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area – save for private clinics, which many cannot afford.
 
The facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented.
 
2. Evidence before this inquest indicated that SHFT has recognised that the mental health provision for those with personality disorders must move towards an individual, therapeutic and trauma-informed approached, which is both compassionate and recovery focused. It is evident that the ‘Personality Disorder Pathway’ currently being developed is an important step towards that, enabling practitioners and services to take a more holistic and person-centred approach, reducing risk and improving outcomes. I am aware that SHFT have been encouraged to review and further develop the Pathway. I am concerned that that must occur, and at pace.
 
3. I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being suffiently, effectively and meaningfuly listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatement or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions.
 
There remains an over-focus on patient centric assessments and patient only responses. It is recognised that patients can present quite differently to and in the presence of their families, who know them intimately, to how they may (or may be able to) present to assessing clinicians – with or without the intent to mask their condition.",On 04 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Clare TAYLOR aged 33.

Throughout her admission Catriona required 1:1 nursing care which, apart from a short admission to ITU between 08/12/2020 and 15/12/2020, Catriona did not receive. The nursing staff relied on Catriona’s mother to ensure that Catriona received the fluid and medication she required. Catriona’s mother continuously advised the nursing staff that she was unable to ensure that Catriona was receiving fluid and medication, however no assistance was given, and Catriona went into a fatal decline.
 
I found that Catriona’s death would have been prevented if 1:1 nursing care had been provided.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
At the inquest I determined that the level of care that Catriona’s mother was expected to provide was unacceptable but was informed that there are no guidelines to establish the level of delegation of nursing duties in such circumstances, and the requirement of the nursing team to not only continue to supervise care but to support
and intervene as required.","On 19/01/2021, an investigation was opened into the death of Catriona Ellen Martin The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 23/11/2023.

Initially it was thought that she was not badly injured, but her immobility developed leading to an ambulance being called on the 28 December 2022. There was a delay in the ambulance arriving but when it did, she was conveyed to the Leicester Royal infirmary on the 29 December 2022. She was diagnosed with a fractured right ankle and shoulder injury. A boot was put on her right leg for conservative treatment of the fracture, and she was admitted. A doctor reviewed her on the 30 December 2022 and noted that she was taking warfarin to treat atrial fibrillation and decided to put her on dalteparin as they considered her International Normalized Ratio (INR) was too low. No plan was made at that time as to when to review the situation or when to stop the dalteparin. She was not seen by a Consultant Medical Physician until the 03 January 2023. He did not appreciate that she was taking warfarin and dalteparin. The INR was being measured but not considered or reviewed and by the 02 January 2023 it was above 2 which should have initiated stopping the dalteparin. However, it was not stopped at that time. Mrs Walton’s haemoglobin suddenly dropped on the 04 January 2023. On the 05 January 2023 the medical staff noticed that she was on dual anticoagulation therapy and the dalteparin was stopped and Vitamin K and blood was given. She was commenced on antibiotics for a chest infection and taken to radiology for a pelvic x-ray as it was thought that a pelvic fracture may be the source of the blood loss. It was thought that the x-ray showed a fractured pelvis, but this was later confirmed not to be the case. Further investigations were not undertaken to confirm a fracture as Mrs Walton’s condition deteriorated in the radiology department. She returned  to the ward and was treated for pneumonia with antibiotics. Sadly, her condition continued to deteriorate, and she was taken off medications. She died at Leicester General Hospital on the 09 January 2023.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

08/12/2023,05/12/2023,2023-0499,Samuel Jones,Rachael Griffin,Dorset,State Custody related deaths,HM Prison and Probation Service | NHS England,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/samuel-jones-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Samuel-Jones-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0499_Published.pdf,,"The deceased died on the 30th April 2021 after he suspended himself by a ligature in his cell at HMP Portland, Portland, Dorset.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
During the Inquest evidence was heard that:
 
Sam’s mother died by an act of self-harm on the 12th April 2014. Sam was greatly affected by his mother’s death which was  known by the prison and healthcare staff at HMP Portland, however the date of her death was not identified in the prison or healthcare records and was not known to those caring for Sam.
 
Had both prison and healthcare staff been aware of the date they would have spoken to Sam around this time to provide support to him.
 
Prisons nationally use a records system called NOMIS and healthcare providers in prisons nationally use a records system called SystmOne. There is no mechanism in NOMIS or SystmOne to highlight key or trigger dates that may have an impact upon a prisoner.
 
Following the evidence at this Inquest, local processes have been immediately put into place at HMP Portland to ensure that prisoners will be asked about any significant or trigger dates at the initial and second healthcare screen when they arrive at the prison. This information will be recorded on SystmOne manually in the risk information box and a task will be scheduled close to the key date. Prison staff do not have access to SystmOne. This is a local process and not a national one and this issue is likely to arise at all prisons in England and Wales.
 
There is no national guidance or policy on this and no specific question on the SystmOne records, or location in the NOMIS records, to enquire into, or highlight, significant dates for the prisoner.
 
When meeting with a prisoner, prison staff have access to the NOMIS records, however, most of the prison staff who gave evidence at the Inquest stated that they would not read the full records and just look at the last 2 or 3 contacts. Due to the current reduction in staffing levels at HMP Portland as a result of difficulties in recruitment, which is affecting  staffing  within prisons nationally, staff gave evidence that they do not have the time to consider the NOMIS records in full for routine checks or welfare checks under the keyworker scheme. Evidence was also given by a Supervising Officer at the prison that when ACCT reviews are conducted this could be the first time they meet the prisoner and they do not have time to go through all the records due to current staffing pressures.
 
There is no ability to search the NOMIS records by a key word search as there is on SystmOne, so key information about a prisoner may be buried within the case notes section on NOMIS which can be very lengthy. To find out this  information  staff would have to go through all the records  which as stated above is not practically possible due to current staffing levels. As  a result information can be missed.
 
Although there is an alerts page on NOMIS this only allows certain standard entries and there is no free text box to allow bespoke entry of information. This results in key  information about a prisoner being overlooked. Some witnesses gave evidence that they were not aware of Sam’s history contained in the NOMIS records and had they been, they would have acted differently.
 
There is a new version of NOMIS which although being used in the Prison Service at the moment, is still under development which could address these issues.
 
iii. In prison, prisoners  are  prescribed  medication  to  take  either under supervision or in their own possession. This means that a prisoner can self-medicate in their cell. Prescriptions of medications can be given to cover a supply for up to 28 days. Prior to a determination as to whether it would be safe for a prisoner to have medication in their possession, a  risk assessment is undertaken both around the type of medication and the prisoner’s individual risks.
 
Sam was prescribed [REDACTED] and was permitted to take this in possession for a period of 7 days. He last collected this on 26th January 2021, over 3 months before his death. Following his death, he was  found to have [REDACTED] in his blood and [REDACTED]  was found in his cell.
It may have been that he was illicitly obtaining [REDACTED],
however it may also be that he had left over  medication  from that he had been prescribed previously.
 
When a prisoner stops taking medication, healthcare teams have little option other than asking if a person has any leftover medication and are dependent on the prisoner handing any excess medication back. Healthcare teams do not have the power to search a cell although can pass information on to the prison staff if they have any concerns regarding the stockpiling  or access to medication in the cell.
 
There is a local operating policy in place within the healthcare department at HMP Portland to cover medication. Following the evidence heard during the Inquest, this has already been amended to ensure steps are taken to try to ensure that a prisoner does not have any medication in their cell which they should not have. There is, however, no national guidance  to assist both healthcare and Prison Service staff deal with this issue and it is for individual risons to set u their own recesses.","On the 11th May 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death  of Samuel Lewis Jones, born on the 24th November 1998.   ",In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, 30th January 2024.

The Deceased had a history of depression which was made significantly worse by the death of one of her children in 2012. After taking a prescription drug overdose in February 2022, she came under the care of the Community Mental Health Team. After taking a further intentional prescription drug overdose on 3 May 2022, she was provided with a period of in- patient psychiatric treatment. Although she was discharged back to the Community Mental Health Team following her discharge, she did not attend her appointment with the Community Psychiatrist on 14 July 2022. By early August 2022, although it was clear that her mental health had deteriorated and that her relationship with her Community Mental Health Team Key Worker had broken down, she was not seen by any clinically qualified staff and had limited mental health support. A crisis point was reached when she awoke in the early hours of 18 August 2022 in distress and, after packing a bag which included half a week’s medication, left her home at 04.00 hours. Police subsequently attended her home and found a note suggesting a possible intention to harm herself. She was deemed to be a high-risk missing person and, after an effective search by police, she was located at the Travelodge in Toddington; although she denied being suicidal, police made further referrals to the Mental Health Team and Social/Children Services with concerns for her welfare. Although requested by Social/Children Services to see her, the Community Health Team did not go to see her but, instead, attempted to contact her by telephone. When the Deceased called them back at around 16.09 hours, her call was answered by administrative staff and, when she could not be put through to the clinically trained Duty Officer, she terminated the call. Although the Duty Officer called her back shortly after, she did not answer and no further action was taken. At around midnight, Travelodge staff found the Deceased slumped in the hallway outside her room. On informing them that she had depression, Covid 19, and had taken an overdose [REDACTED], they called an ambulance. Owing to service demand, there was a 3 hour wait for an ambulance and, when the paramedics arrived at 03.43, they found her in cardiac arrest on the bed in her room. Despite all resuscitation efforts, her death was confirmed at 04.29 hours. A bag containing multiple packs of medication [REDACTED]was found under the bed and post- mortem examination confirmed that she had a blood level of [REDACTED] within the fatal range as well as an excess of [REDACTED].

The inquest heard evidence that her mortality risk was around 40%. She provided verbal consent to the ascitic tap procedure but was not told there was a rare possibility of death if a surrounding structure were to be perforated. It appeared the procedure had been accomplished uneventfully on Friday 25/2/22, but within hours she complained of pain around the site of the procedure. On the Friday evening and during Saturday (25/26 February) her condition deteriorated, yet she was not reviewed or examined, nor were any other investigations initiated which may have halted this decline. On Sunday 27 February she was found in an unresponsive condition and died that day. Her family had not been forewarned of the seriousness of her illness, nor that her life was in danger and consequently went home some hours before she died.",,"On 11th March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ms Samantha Jade Shillito, aged 38. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 30 November 2023. A narrative conclusion was reached which recorded Ms Shillito’s medical history of alcoholic liver disease and depression. During a hospital admission in February 2022, she underwent an ascitic tap procedure that inadvertently perforated an artery, causing intra-abdominal bleeding that resulted in her death two days later. Within hours of the procedure, she was prescribed oramorph and other pain-relieving medications. The deterioration in her condition did not trigger a medical review and hence an opportunity was lost on the weekend of 25/26 February to initiate treatment to ameliorate this deterioration.

Biopsies were initially inconclusive for cancer. A PET scan on 8th February confirmed advanced colorectal cancer. A stoma was inserted laparoscopically on 14th February to assist with his bowel symptoms. He was not seen for chemotherapy consideration until 6th March 2023. His health had deteriorated significantly since his referral on the cancer pathway and his suitability for chemotherapy was borderline. The plan was to start it around 17th March. In the period he developed spinal cord compression and received radiotherapy which was given on 21st March. He continued to deteriorate with the cancer having spread into his brain. Chemotherapy was not started until 4th April 2023.He deteriorated rapidly with the cancer having spread aggressively. He died at Stamford Court on 28th April 2023.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
The inquest heard evidence that a national shortage of specialist scanning facilities such as was required in Mr Williams’ case meant that there were delays nationally with the diagnosis of cancers. This in turn led to delays in treatment and poorer outcomes for cancer patients as delays in diagnosis meant that the cancer would often have advanced further, and treatment was less likely to be successful. This was compounded by the fact that additional complications such as cord compression could arise whilst a scan was awaited and that the patient would be less able to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy when it ultimately started.
 
The inquest also heard evidence that there were significant delays nationally in compliance with the two-week cancer pathway which led to poorer outcomes for patients as any delay in treatment reduced the likelihood of a successful outcome.
 
Evidence was also heard that the delay Mr Williams faced between diagnosis and being seen for a plan to be developed was also part of a wider national picture of delay in accessing cancer treatments and again reduced the chances of a successful treatment outcome.",On 3rd May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony Eric Williams. The investigation concluded on the 27th September 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of bowel cancer not diagnosed and not treated until it had reached an advanced stage. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 26th January 2024.

Julia was 89 years of age at the time if her death.
 
On 06/04/2023 Julia suffered a fall in the care home where she resided, she was admitted to hospital, however, she was too unwell for surgery to the fracture she had sustained when she fell. Notwithstanding all appropriate care and treatment in hospital Julia’s condition deteriorated culminating in her death.
 
From the time Julia was resident in the care home she suffered 21 falls, the first being on 15/01/2022 and the last being on 06/04/2023. The final fall when Julia sustained a fracture to her hip caused her death.
 
During her stay in the care home only 3 referrals were made for advice from the specialist falls prevention team, the first on 30/09/2022, the second on 24/11/2022 the day after her 13th fall on 23/11/2023, it is worthy of note, there was no response from the falls prevention referral on the first occasion and a second referral was not made until Julia had fallen again.
 
A physiotherapist assessed Julia on 10/01/2023 and recommended the use of a zimmer frame, on 19/01/2023 the falls prevention team recommend Julia should use a zimmer frame, a falls sensor mat, a crash mat and they also recommended Julia should be encouraged to come out of her room during the day. A crash mat was deemed inappropriate.
 
The third referral to the falls team was made on 10/03/2023, this referral stated ……. “Sheila has had 18 falls since 01/01/2022”. Julia had suffered four falls over the 5th & 6th March 2023.
 
The first referral form (reason for referral box, on page 1) stated “struggling to walk even short distances and is holding to everything when walking. It might be better with a Zimmer frame or something similar to that”. There was no mention in the reason for referral box of Julia’s falls history even though at the time she had fallen 12 times when that fall occurred.
 
The referral form dated 24/11/2022, (reason for referral box) stated “had a few falls since January this year, sensor mat is in place and OT referral was sent on 30/09/22 and that has been chased up today 24/11/2022”. By the 24/11/2022 Julia had fallen 13 times.
 
The first referral, in the reasons for referral box did not describe the fact that Julia had suffered 12 falls, as it should have done, and it was not followed up as it should have been until the day after she had fallen on 23/11/2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Julia had 21 falls, the final fall led to her death. The 3 referral forms sent to falls prevention were incomplete, misleading and/or inaccurate.

On 30 June 2021 Katherine was referred to the syringomyelia clinic (specialist clinic for patients with a syrinx). Although Katherine had back pain there was not felt to be a spinal surgical cause for this, and she was discharged from the complex spine clinic but was then referred to the pain team. Katherine had a history of progressive sensory and motor symptoms on the right side and because this could not be explained by her syrinx, an urgent MRI brain scan was requested. This scan was performed on 31 August 2021 and reported as normal. On 13 December 2021 Katherine was seen by a Consultant in Pain Medicine who noted the brain MRI of August looked abnormal and requested a review of the scan. On review there was a mass lesion that had been missed. Katherine underwent a further MRI of the brain where she was found to have tumour (left superior cerebellar / left quadrigeminal cistern region) which had increased in size by approximately 10mm since 31 August 2021. On 18 January 2022 a biopsy was undertaken to establish the type of tumour and a further scan took place on 2 February 2022 when the tumour was felt to have increased in size further. The tumour was found to be an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT). This being a highly malignant central nervous system neoplasm which generally affects infants and is reported to rarely occur in adults. The prognosis of this type of tumour was poor. The management plan was to remove as much of the tumour as possible and then treat it with chemotherapy and radiation. Katherine was consented for the procedure where the risk to life was deemed low. Katherine was admitted to the Walton Centre on 21 February 2022 and underwent the surgery on 22 February 2022. The surgery was uneventful, and a large portion of the tumour was removed but there was still part of the tumour that remained as it could not be removed. Post -operatively, Katherine was slow to wake, and a CT brain scan showed there was some blood at the site of surgery, and it was reviewed by the operating surgeons and no further surgery was felt to be necessary. The plan was to leave the external ventricular drain (EVD) in and continue high dose steroids to help reduce post operative swelling. Katherine was transferred to the intensive care unit to be kept sedated and ventilated overnight. As the sedation was reduced, Katherine became aware of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and bit down on it causing significant trauma to her tongue at the same time. The sedation was increased to enable Katherine to tolerate the tube again. Later that day the tongue was noted to be very swollen and was assessed as being a risk to the airway which prevented the removal of the ETT. The sedation was reduced over the ensuing 48 hours and neurological assessment showed improvement, eye opening to stimuli, obeying commands on the left side however there was still a severe weakness on the right side.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The case is a complex death where the immediate cause of death was blockage of an external ventricular drain resulting in hydrocephalus and coning. The written policy at this Trust, at the time, was not entirely clear about how the nursing staff should escalate things when a drain stopped draining but was still seen to be oscillating. Though some Trusts have developed their own policy on this area, these vary as there is currently no standard national policy dealing with this issue. This is a risk which needs to be highlighted at a national level.",On 23 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Katherine Sarah FLYNN aged 34.

He needed to use the toilet so a member of ambulance staff lowered the bed rails and sat Mr Cruse on the edge of the bed before then going to get a wheelchair to transport him to the toilets. Mr Cruse then stood up and fell. He sustained a significant chest injury, including multiple rib fractures, a haemopneumothorax and surgical emphysema. He was cared for on a surgical ward in accordance with the admissions pathway, with input from the older persons medical team.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
Secretary of State for Health
1) That over 75% of patients receiving hospital care are 65 and over. There is a conflict and tension between where within the hospital those patients should be receiving their care. A proportion of these patients require admission to a surgical ward due to the elements of their care which require surgical oversight and management, for example, analgesia through an epidural, insertion of a chest drain. However, this group of patients have multiple co-morbidities and complexities due to their age, which would be better managed by a medical team specialising in care of the elderly. Whilst medical teams can review patients, their limited resources mean it may not be as quickly as it needs to be, and they cannot be proactive in following up on the care of these patients. This results in an increasing risk that these patients will not receive the care they need in a timely manner. There is an increasing need for more doctors specialising in the care of older persons and this is a national issue.",On 12th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Gerald Roy Cruse.

At birth B was diagnosed with congenital abnormalities including Oesophageal Atresia (OA) and Tracheo-Oesophageal Fistula (TOF), a condition denoted by a blind-ending upper oesophagus with the lower oesophagus connected to the trachea, which affects about 200 babies a year in England. B had an initial surgical procedure to disconnect the TOF and join the oesophagus, but the gap between the two parts of the oesophagus was too great at that time to join. This is known as long gap Oesophageal Atresia (OA), a condition which affects about 20 babies a year in England. Management of long gap OA is very significantly more challenging than non-long gap OA. There are different options for treatment of long gap OA. In this case the surgical team applied tension sutures to draw the oesophageal ends closer for later joining. B had a second planned surgical procedure to check whether the oesophagus was capable of being joined and it was not. At the third planned surgical procedure, an oesophageal anastomosis was performed. Following the third surgical procedure, B developed respiratory complications as a result of which he died.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

01/12/2023,27/11/2023,2023-0482,Barbara Rymell,Samantha Marsh,Somerset,Care Home Health related deaths,Home Office | Department of Health and Social Care,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/barbara-rymell-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Barbara-Rymell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0482_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-0482-Response-from-Home-Office.pdf,"Barbara became a resident of Ashley House Residential Home in Langport (“Ashley House”) on the 8th August 2022. She took up residency on discharge from hospital where she had had an inpatient stay as a result of a fall in the community.
 
On becoming a resident of Ashley House Barbara had a known diagnosis of dementia, which sometimes affected her memory. She was at a high risk of falling and had blurred vision. All in all, she was a relatively frail elderly woman with known risks around her mobility and she relied on others to keep her safe.
 
Barbara was the only resident with a bedroom on the first floor of Ashley House. This could only be accessed via the stairs (which Barbara was incapable of ascending or descending safely) or the mechanically operated stairlift (which Barbara was not permitted to use unattended or unsupervised.)
 
On the evening of the 8th of August 2022 two carers were on duty; neither of whom were native English speaking nationals; one was Romanian and the other was Indian.
 
I was told that in order to be able to work in the UK, those requiring a Visa (as the two carers on duty did) must prove that they can read, write, speak and understand English to at least Level B1…. [that they must demonstrate that they] can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work”. Applicants for a Visa must have passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT).
 
It transpired during the Inquest that one of the workers on the evening of the 8th August 2022 had never passed the SELT, so was not qualified or permitted to work in the UK.
 
At 19:27 one of the carers called 999 to request an ambulance. It was clear, on the evidence, that Barbara had been left unattended on the mechanical chair for around five minutes. This was clearly contrary to the rules and procedures of Ashley House. During those five minutes she has left the seat of the mechanically operated stairlift (possibly unfastening the seat belt) and proceeded to climb the stairs; which she was unable to safely, due to do physical limitations and her underlying cognitive impairment.
 
She has fallen on the stairs, falling downwards. There were no witnesses to this incident but Barbara has been found, having fallen awkwardly, landing with her head trapped under the chair for the mechanically operated stairlift. Care staff were unable to free her because of the positioning and angle at which she was entrapped within the mechanics.
 
On calling 999 (copies of both recordings were played at the Inquest) it was obvious that neither of the care staff were sufficiently proficient in English to be able to:
Explain clearly the nature of the medical emergency. An internal audit by the ambulance service revealed that the call-handler had selected an incorrect pathway. The correct pathway that should have been selected was “entrapment” but at no time during the call did the carer give any
information that would have indicated that this was the presenting problem. The carer repeated used the word “blocked” which added no assistance, clarity of explanation of the events that were unfolding.
 
Understand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing”. This made any meaningful triage of Barbara’s condition virtually impossible. The call handler followed the script to ask if the patient was conscious and breathing (i.e. to ascertain clinical emergency and determination of a priority response) but this assessment was severely hampered given the carer did not appear to know or understand the difference between bleeding and breathing.
 
Understand the difference between “alert” and “alive”, which presented all of the same problems as referred in in (ii) above.
 
Paramedics arrived on a category 2 response and, on arrival, it was clear that Barbara was beyond medical help. She was pronounced deceased at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I am concerned that those working with vulnerable people who are in a position of trust and responsibility must be able to demonstrate a sufficient proficiency in English to enable to summon appropriate emergency medical attention when needed. Vulnerable people, by very definition, are unable to often appreciate the need for help; take steps to keep themselves safe and/or summon help for themselves when they need it.
 
By being unable to speak the native language of England with any proficiency I am concerned that deaths will continue to arise where those who are young, disabled, suffering from a mental impairment or who are elderly and in need of urgent medical help will not have this summoned for them if those who are engaging with emergency professionals are unable to communicate effectively.
 
The Court looked at evidence of the B1 English test. Examples from the paper were as follows:
“I                      that book last year” (options are bought, have bought, had bought)
“The town,                  is very beautiful, has lots of parks” (options are which, where, what).
This level of comprehension is comparable to a KS2 curriculum being studied by Year 6 students sitting their SATS exam and appears to be wholly insufficient for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people, as demonstrated in this case by carers who were alone (i.e. no English speaking members of staff on duty) being unable to explain to medical professionals the presenting condition of the patient.","On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Jean Rymell, aged 91 (“Barbara”).

On 31 August 2018 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool Hospital presenting with vomiting and right upper quadrant pain, a known complication after a TACE procedure. Various medications were prescribed but the pain was ongoing. On 11 September 2018, whilst still in hospital, Amirah was prescribed dexamethasone (a steroid), initially [REDACTED] twice daily and  then [REDACTED] once a day. She was then discharged from hospital. A discharge summary was sent to her General Practice (GP) requesting the steroid medication to be reviewed. When the steroids were prescribed there was no indication noted as to the length of the intended treatment course in the clinical notes or in the discharge letter issued by the hospital team. In April 2019 the steroids were noted as a repeat prescription in the GP records rather than an acute prescription. It is unclear upon what basis this was done. On 12 June 2019 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital with dizzy spells. It was noted that her high blood pressure was poorly controlled. Her dexamethasone was continued in hospital and on discharge. A discharge summary was sent to her GP practice with the steroids to be continued. On 12 September 2019 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool hospital with similar symptoms. Her dexamethasone was continued again in hospital and on discharge. Throughout 2019-2022 Amirah had numerous consultations with various specialists in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. On 29 December 2022 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital feeling generally unwell and with leg pain. Treating medical professionals deemed that Amirah’s case was complex and multiple organ systems were investigated and treated. Despite active treatment Amirah deteriorated and died on 31 January 2023. The post mortem examination found it was more likely than not Amirah died as a result of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis and intestinal haemorrhage as a result of long term steroid therapy. Throughout, on each discharge from hospital, a discharge letter was sent to Amirah’s GP and was generally to continue the dexamethasone. There were a number of failures relating to the care and treatment afforded to Amirah; through numerous appointments an incomplete medication history was taken and documented which did not include dexamethasone. Amirah had multiple complex conditions and was under the care of numerous specialists, many of whom clearly did not appreciate she was on steroids, and had been, for a lengthy period of time. Amirah was seen by numerous clinicians both in the hospital and in the community and at no stage was it questioned as to why she was still on the steroids, and why at the high dose she was on. Evidence has been heard that it was rare for a patient to be on these steroids at this dose for a lengthy period of time. Amirah presented with symptoms clearly suggestive of the possibility of complications of steroid use, namely uncontrollable blood pressure, diabetes, swelling and cognitive impairment. There was a failure to recognise these obvious presentations and the link between them and the long term steroid use. There was a failure to document in the clinical notes and / or in the discharge letter, the indication or length of the dexamethasone tablets. This failure prevented adequate instructions being provided to Amirah’s GP as to the intended length of the dexamethasone treatment and monitoring of the same. There was a failure for the GP to clarify the discharge with the hospital and to review the medication, this failure was exacerbated by the fact the prescription was changed to repeat from acute with no apparent reason. Overall, there was a catalogue of missed opportunities both in hospital as well as in the community to identify that Amirah remained unnecessarily on dexamethasone tablets despite multiple reviews as an inpatient and outpatient. Even when the ongoing prescription was identified, and Amirah was symptomatic of Cushing’s disease and steroid induced diabetes the correct action to wean treatment completely was not undertaken. It is a basic and fundamental expectation for a clinician in charge of a patient’s care to monitor and review prescribed medication, particularly acute medication such as steroids. There was a failure to do this for Amirah despite the fact that there were numerous opportunities to do so over a lengthy period of time. The accumulation of failures through the primary and secondary care services has led to a gross failure to provide basic medical attention to Amirah who was in a dependent position and had every reason to rely upon those who had management of her care and treatment to prescribe, monitor and review her medication. It is more likely than not the inappropriate and prolonged administration of steroids caused Amirah’s death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The current SCR model does not appear to automatically flag drugs such as steroids, which are known to have potentially fatal side effects if used for the long term without appropriate monitoring. It is understood that some drugs do have these flags, but that steroids do not.
 
In addition, the SCR does not have a space recording for clinical indication for initiation of the drugs, to aid a future prescriber to consider whether the drug is still clinically indicated.",On 06 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Amirah KHALIFA aged 42.

Gracie decided that she did not want to have any sort of relationship with the supervisor and made this clear to him in December 2020. The supervisor failed to accept Gracie’s decision and became obsessed and fixated with her. Gracie reported the supervisor’s behaviour to Xbite in January 2021 and he was subsequently dismissed from Xbite in February 2021.   ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
Derbyshire Constabulary:
 
Stalking – during the inquest I heard evidence from the police officers who were involved in investigating Gracie’s stalking complaint in February 2021. Derbyshire Constabulary accepted that there were serious failings in how Gracie’s complaint was investigated by these officers. I do recognise that Derbyshire Constabulary has taken some steps following Gracie’s death to improve knowledge around stalking. However, as the Detective Chief Superintendent who gave evidence for the Constabulary accepted, more needs to be done to improve knowledge and understanding around how officers should investigate complaints of stalking. Consideration may be given to:
 
Reviewing the current force guidance/training on stalking and considering whether further guidance/training is required in light of the issues identified during the inquest (including consideration of whether there ought to be a force policy on stalking);
 
Re-enforcing understanding of the existing training/guidance on stalking including consideration of further training sessions/briefings to emphasise the key issues around investigating complaints of stalking, particularly in relation to the need to investigate the stalking complaint fully in order to identify potential patterns in the suspect’s alleged behaviour;
 
Ensuring officers are aware of the available resources on stalking and, crucially, the importance of actually consulting the available resources on stalking when police officers are investigating stalking cases to ensure that investigations are conducted in line with expected standards.
 
Risk assessments – during the inquest I saw a number of good quality risk assessments completed by police call handlers/officers who were involved in the very early stages of Gracie’s stalking complaint in February 2021 and also the rucksack incident in May 2021. However, it became apparent during the inquest that the police officers who were subsequently allocated to deal with the stalking complaint and the rucksack incident failed to record any form of risk assessment or fully assess the potential risks. As was recognised by the Detective Chief Superintendent who gave evidence for the Constabulary at the inquest, the crime report for the stalking investigation in February 2021 lacked any sort of risk assessment or even a recognition of potential risks. I heard evidence from the police officers involved in the stalking investigation and the rucksack incident and I am concerned that there may be an ongoing lack of understanding about the importance of completing comprehensive risk assessments which include the initial identification of risk and also, importantly, a regular re-assessment of risk as the investigation progresses. I consider that further steps should be considered in order to improve understanding and appreciation of the importance of completing comprehensive risk assessments.
 
Independent Office for Police Conduct (“IOPC”) – the IOPC carried out an investigation into the conduct of the five officers involved in the stalking investigation and the rucksack incident. The IOPC made a number of recommendations to Derbyshire Constabulary which included:
 
‘2. To consider how stalking offence locations are recorded on Niche. There does not appear to be any guidance to suggest that all of the locations of the stalking offending are tagged to the incident individually. In this instance it may not have made any difference as the officers who received the bag did not do a search of police systems for the area. However, in future that may well be done, and it could make the difference between linking risk and suspects.’
 
I heard evidence about this issue from the Detective Chief Superintendent on behalf of the Constabulary and I am concerned that more needs to be done to engage with this specific recommendation from the IOPC. The inquest heard that specific geographical locations can be particularly important in stalking investigations (i.e the horse field in Gracie’s case). As such, it seems to me that the IOPC recommendation is an important one which could assist in future cases with linking suspects and particular locations relevant to the stalking investigation.
 
Contemporaneous note taking/record keeping – during the inquest I heard that police officers failed to make any contemporaneous notes of important steps in the police investigation including, for example, conversations with an informant/member of the public, words of advice given to a suspect, a telephone call to a potential witness and also an internal police discussion between a police constable and police sergeant discussing the closure of an investigation. The written crime reports reviewed during the inquest also lacked sufficient detail around these important conversations/investigative steps – in other words, the crime reports did not compensate for the lack of contemporaneous notes.
 
I am concerned that a lack of contemporaneous notes/insufficient detail within a crime report may impact on the ability to make properly informed risk assessments which rely on the existence of a good written record of important conversations/steps taken during an investigation. This may become an issue where, for example, an investigation is re-allocated to another police officer who has had no prior involvement in the investigation such that the newly allocated police officer will be reliant upon the quality of the original police officer’s records/notes.",On 21 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gracie Elizabeth Spinks (“Gracie”) who was 23 years old when she died on 18 June 2021.

Hazel Pearson was admitted into Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 20/8/21 having spent some time at a care home and community hospital before returning to Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 23/11/21. She had known coeliac disease which was recorded on her medical records. Her family had repeatedly informed staff about her coeliac disease. On 26/11/21 she was offered and consumed Weetabix probably believing it was a gluten free equivalent. This caused her to vomit, aspirate, suffer significant oxygenation and subsequent respiratory deterioration which then led to her death from aspiration pneumonia. She died on 30/11/21 at Ysbyty Maelor, Wrexham.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. Despite the deceased passing away just shy of 2 years ago, there have been inadequate improvements to manage patients with food intolerances and allergies. The Health Board has been working with other organisations in Wales to create an e-learning module and implement the use of red wrist bands for food intolerances / allergies, but this has taken far too long. The e-learning training module was uploaded to BCUHB system the day prior to the Inquest. It is strongly suspected that this was due to the impending Inquest.
 
2. The Health Board has not investigated the incident at all. A Medical Examiner Report was prepared following the death in November 2021 highlighting the ingestion of gluten in a coeliac patient. I have raised and continue to raise a number of concerns around the inadequacy of governance and poor investigation processes.
 
3. There were other incidences of gluten ingestion at Ysbyty Maelor and Deeside Community Hospital. On the at least 4 occasions at Deeside Community Hospital there were no Datix reports completed at the time. I was provided with no evidence that additional training, refresher training or induction training deals with when such reports should be made.

All three deaths feature delays first in emergency ambulance response times and secondly, handing over the patient from the ambulance crew to hospital staff.
 
I want to be clear that these three deaths are not isolated cases. They are just an illustration of the sorts of cases this area has dealt with regularly over the last two years or so.
 
I understand my colleague, Assistant Coroner Davies, also feels his duties under PFD Regulations are engaged and he will be writing to you in similar terms in relation to inquests he has conducted.","The circumstances described above are now longstanding. I wrote a Preventing Future Deaths report to your predecessor just over a year ago setting out details of four deaths that had arisen in similar circumstances.
 
During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
It was acknowledged in the evidence that matters had improved over the summer this year. What is of concern, however, is that these gains have not been maintained and the situation has now worsened with 15-20 ambulances waiting outside the ED on occasions over the last three weeks. I have spoken to the Medical Director at RCHT, [REDACTED], and he has confirmed that is the current position. This concern is compounded by the recognition that we are yet to experience the additional pressures that winter will bring.
 
Additionally, I am now hearing evidence at inquest of ‘burn-out’ among paramedics, nurses and doctors. At the inquest into the death of Mrs Steggles, I was advised that the hospital is now finding it difficult to recruit to vacant positions.","Over the past week, I have concluded the following three inquests. John Charles Seagrove Mr Seagrove was an 88-year-old man who died in Royal Cornwall Hospital on 9/7/22. His medical cause of death was found to have been:   
1a) Aspiration pneumonia; 
1b) Ischaemic stroke.   ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.
 
I set out in my PFD last year my understanding of the reasons for the difficulties that are continuing in the Cornwall & Isles of Scilly coroner area. I do not believe those reasons will have changed significantly.
 
The challenges are systemic in nature. They are too big for a single doctor, nurse or paramedic to fix. They are too big for either the hospital trust or the ambulance trust to fix on their own.
 
It is for you and your department to take the action that is required to resolve the issues and to prevent future patients in the area from dying avoidable deaths. It is not for me as coroner to make recommendations on how you do that and so I leave that to you.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 20 January 2024.

They were murdered by Terri’s partner Damien Bendall, curfewed to the address under a suspended sentence order, who had inflicted severe head injuries on all four, and he had also raped Lacey.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Probation Service (PS) offender records and documents.
 
The inquests identified that very concerning information regarding Damien Bendall was made known to the PS (including violent assault and injury of a partner, and an incident of possible child sexual abuse) but was not recorded clearly or prominently for subsequent PS practitioners to read and evaluate in risk assessment and decision- making, and indeed was not read at key and critical points. Although this was in part due to the recording made by individual PS practitioners it was also the result of confusing proformas (e.g. the OASys misleading drop-down boxes and the open and closed sections), imprecise arrangements and expectations of how and where such information should be recorded, and where checks should be directed and made when the records needed to be reviewed. The inquests were informed of current PS expectations for recording offender risk information and assessments, but I remain very unsure that there are clear and efficient recording arrangements and systems to ensure that risk information is accurate, prominent, easily seen, and easily updateable by PS practitioners.
 
PS domestic abuse (DA) and child safeguarding (SG) checks
 
The inquests identified that DA and SG checks were either insufficient or wholly lacking at various stages of Damien Bendall’s offender management. The current evidence is that DA and SG checks remain generally insufficient or are not being done with consequent on-going risks to children and women.
 
Insufficient or absent PS DA and SG checks has been a theme of HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and reviews for at least the last 5 years. On HM Inspectorate of Probation case sampling to determine whether domestic abuse and child safeguarding enquiries were being undertaken when indicated, the HM Inspectorate of Probation Annual Report for 2022/2023 states at page 38: –
 
where inspectors judged that these enquiries needed to be made by the probation practitioner, child safeguarding enquiries were carried out in 55 per cent of cases, domestic abuse enquiries were only carried out in 49 per cent of cases and risk of harm was only properly addressed in 39 per cent.
 
The PS is not currently conducting SG checks in all cases where an offender will live with or have access to children.
 
The PS has mandated that in all cases where a curfew condition is proposed to the court in a pre-sentence report (PSR) DA and SG checks will be conducted prior to the proposal and submission of the PSR: this is not being done in all cases. I am also unclear whether contact to the address homeowner/lead tenant for a potential curfew condition to discuss the suitability of a curfew condition is being undertaken in all cases.
 
Relatedly, although I have not taken evidence on this wider issue, it appears to me that the systems for conducting DA and SG checks are generally severely strained. I say this because as an example the PS has now employed staff to make the checks from police records and has had to do this because the police service itself is unable to check and provide the information to the PS within necessary timeframes.
 
PS PSR reports
 
There is no evidence that DA and SG checks were made by the PS practitioner in respect of Damien Bendall’s PSR report. Via the report the court was informed that checks had been conducted. The PS practitioner put forward a curfew provision as appropriate and the report was written in such a way to indicate that the report writer had checked the suitability of the curfew address, when she had not in fact done so. Had the court not been misled it is unlikely that the court’s disposal would have included a curfew requirement.
 
The inquests heard that PSRs written by the same PS practitioner, reviewed before her submission of Damien Bendall’s PSR, and reports reviewed after the murders, also lacked evidence of DA and SG checks having been made even though they were stated to have been done in the reports.
 
Evidence from senior PS staff was to the effect that failing to undertake the checks and failure to make this explicitly clear in a PSR might be dealt with by management feedback to the PS practitioner but is an unlikely to be a disciplinary matter. This leads me to question whether, given the potentially very disastrous outcomes in terms of public protection, the PS is failing to grasp the seriousness of the issue, to make this explicit to PS practitioners, and ensure that there are commensurate penalties for staff where these professional duties have been breached.
 
PS DA and SG training
 
A significant issue in the inquests was the fact that the very inexperienced staff who were (wrongly) allocated Damien Bendall’s case on transfer to the East Midlands PS region had insufficient DA and SG training. The PS states it has introduced more robust DA and SG training, but it is unclear whether PS practitioners are receiving this before cases are allocated to them to manage.
 
Reporting concerns to the PS by the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS)
 
Damien Bendall made the comment “if this relationship goes bad I’ll murder my girlfriend and the children” to the EMS field operative who fitted his tag and monitoring equipment but this was not reported back by the field operative to her manager nor to the PS. EMS has stated that it has introduced relevant training but the inquest heard evidence from the field operative that comments made by offenders which can be interpreted as potentially posing risk are currently routinely not being reported back by EMS field operatives.
 
The inquests examined the relevant contract terms between the Ministry of Justice and Capita (EMS) relating to reporting concerns and there did appear to be lack of clarity on reporting mechanisms and issues to report.
 
Notification of missed substance misuse appointments to the PS
 
In Derbyshire the substance misuse services provided to offenders where there is a court-imposed sentence requirement for such services is provided under the auspices of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS FT. Damien Bendall was subject to an alcohol treatment requirement. The precise number is not clear on the records, but he missed 4 or 5 appointments with the service between 21 July and his first attended appointment on 17 September 2021, but the required proforma attendance/non-attendance forms were not sent by the substance misuse service to notify the PS.","On 23 September 2021 I commenced investigations into the deaths of Terri Liz Harris aged 35, her children John-Paul Bennett and Lacey Bennett, aged 13 and 11 respectively, and their friend Connie Gent aged 11. The investigations concluded at the end of the inquests on 23 October 2023.

Lauren’s name did not appear on the Out-of-Area Hospital Overview document until 19.11.21 and then she was listed in as being in an acute bed not a PICU.
 
There was a complete absence of records of purported discussions with regard to allocating/denying Lauren one of the many beds available over the 5 months following her readiness for step-down to a rehabilitation unit and readiness for repatriation to a local bed in the interim.
 
During the course of the inquest Dorset Health made the following admission,
 
Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust have admitted that there were shortcomings in its systems for recording the identity and relevant circumstances of its out of area patients, and in its processes for assessing those patients when a bed becomes vacant. As a result, there may have been missed opportunities to offer Lauren a bed.
 
Dorset Healthcare were unable to provide a witness to deal with this issue and, having recognised the seriousness of these omission, stated via correspondence an intention to carry out a further review upon conclusion of the inquest.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are,
a) the omission to update the Hospital Overview timeously and correctly.
 
b) it can be inferred from the absence of any documentation regarding discussions about Lauren’s repatriation to an available bed that no such discussion took place.","On 01.03.22 an investigation commenced into the death of Lauren Elizabeth Bridges who died on 26.02.22, aged 20 years.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

Charlotte Burton was aged 40 when she became pregnant with her second child. She had a BMI of 45 and was using methadone as part of her treatment plan. As a result, she was under regular surveillance during her pregnancy and had regular growth scans as her age, BMI and methadone use all placed her in the high-risk category.
 
2. While some concerns were raised regarding care during pregnancy, labour and immediately after delivery, which were investigated by the HSIB and reviewed by an independent expert Obstetrician, none of these were causative of Charlotte’s death.
 
3. Charlotte returned to hospital on 27 November 2020. While speaking to a neonatal nurse, she was increasingly short of breath, she coughed up blood and was transferred to the emergency department.
 
4. In considering the care provided to Charlotte at this stage, expert evidence in the fields of Obstetrics, Intensive Care Medicine & Anaesthesia and Cardiology.
 
5. Based on the expert evidence it was found that from the time Charlotte arrived in the ED, she had a number of signs and symptoms which pointed towards a likely respiratory and/or cardiac pathology which included shortness of breath, coughing up blood, fast respiratory rate requiring supplemental oxygen, bilateral lung crepitations and hypertension.
 
6. The initial medical review was reasonably comprehensive and the differential diagnosis and management plan appropriate, and appropriate blood tests and investigations were requested. The junior doctor quite appropriately included cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis.
 
7. Charlotte was given Frusemide due to concerns about heart failure and pulmonary oedema. As heart failure was being considered, the high blood pressure should also have been addressed. Expert evidence was that Frusemide should have been given twice a day, so a further dose should have been given around 1900 hours.
 
8. Charlotte had a raised NT-proBNP level and this is a test for heart failure, but can also be raised with pre-eclampsia. A chest x-ray was said to be difficult to interpret, but did have signs of significant pulmonary oedema.
 
9. A history of Charlotte having to sit on the side of her bed to catch her breath when she got up in the morning, was also said to be consistent with signs of heart failure.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN ARE:
 
1. The evidence indicates that there is a nationwide shortage of suitably trained Cardiologists and that, particularly in District General Hospital setting, this means that out of hours there is no provision for patients presenting with suspected cardiac problems to be assessed in person by a Cardiologist. The system is therefore reliant upon doctors of different specialities or cardiac nurses recognising the condition and the need for contact with specialist at a different Trust. This still does not allow for in person assessment unless there is a transfer which is not always possible due to the severity of the condition or cannot be achieved in a suitable timescale and this represents on ongoing risk of future deaths.",On 7 October 2021 an inquest in to the death of Charlotte Burton was opened. Charlotte died on 28 November 2020. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 November 2023.

ii. There was no appointment of an interim Care Coordinator or a Community Psychiatric Nurse to cover the 2 weekly planned appointments following the absence of YL.
 
iii. There was no responsibility on a Duty officer to review planned appointments during the absence of a Care Coordinator and to arrange for a Community Psychiatric Nurse to attend any planned appointments.
 
iv. There were no resilience plans in place to cover the absence of a Care Coordinator, either in relation to short term or long- term absences.
 
2. I request that the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust reviews their procedures and policies to cover the absence of a Care Coordinator, both in relation to short term and long-term absences, and in relation to the appointment of an interim Care Coordinator.

Whilst in the community Mr Huntley had been under the care of Steps to Wellbeing for PTSD and anxiety. He had disclosed daily suicidal thoughts to them with no intent to act upon these thoughts. The recall notification of the 22/5/20 stated that Mr Huntley reported low mood and claimed to want to take his own life but was not brave enough to do so. This information from the recall notice was not recorded in the record keeping system which could be accessed by all prison security staff (NOMIS).
 
Mr Huntley denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm when asked by the police on the 23/02/2020. During the reception process at HMP Winchester he denied thoughts of suicide or self-harm.
 
On the 25/05/2020 Mr Huntley called for help [REDACTED]. He later disclosed that this had been a planned act with the intent to end his own life. He had taken steps to avoid being discovered and had only called for help when he awoke [REDACTED].
                                                                                   .
Mr Huntley was subsequently taken to hospital and discharged later the same morning. Having left hospital he collapsed and was admitted to the Healthcare wing of the prison for observations.
 
An ACCT document was opened. This is a way of monitoring persons in custody who are at risk of harm. During previous periods of imprisonment in 2010 and 2016 ACCT documents had been opened for Mr Huntley. These documents were not contained within in core records as should have been the case and still cannot be located. Their existence, and the circumstances of the 2016 ACCT, were recorded on NOMIS.
 
Mr Huntley was initially placed on 30-minute observations when the 2023 ACCT was opened, this was reduced to hourly observations after the first case review on the 25/05/2020 and then to 3 random observations overnight after the second case review on the 27/05/2020. These changes were made following assessment meetings involving Mr Huntley, prison staff and staff from the NHS Trust providing physical and mental health interventions within the prison.
 
Mr Huntley denied further thoughts of self-harm or suicide during these meetings.
On the 28/05/2020 Mr Huntley was moved from his original cell in the healthcare wing to cell
13. Cell 13 was located in the area of the healthcare unit primarily used for patients with mental health difficulties. Apart from cells 6 and 13 all of the cells in this area were designed to have reduced ligature points. However in 2019 telephone points had been installed in each of these cells which protruded from the wall. The decision to move Mr Huntley was made at a Multi-disciplinary meeting at which no-one who had met Mr Huntley to assess his mental health was present.
 
On the evening of the 28/05/20 the night duty prison officer completed their rounds at approximately 20.30 and noted that Mr Huntley was sat on the floor of his cell in a partial blind spot. Between 21.00 and 21.30 the nurse on duty knocked on Mr Huntley’s cell door and received a verbal response.
 
At about 23.30 the prison officer attended to complete the first observations required under the ACCT document for Mr Huntley. They saw that Mr Huntley was in the same position as some 3 hours earlier and Mr Huntley did not respond to him. The officer entered the cell with other prison officers at about 23.35 and found Mr Huntley sat motionless [REDACTED].
 
The prison officers cut the ligature and commenced CPR. An emergency call was put out and further prison officers and both on-duty nurses attended. Those present provided CPR to Mr Huntley until the arrival of paramedics. Sadly despite the efforts of staff and the attending medics Mr Huntley could not be revived and his life was declared extinct.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
ACCT documents
In evidence at the inquest ACCT assessors and case managers accepted that they had not complied with various mandatory actions required under PSI 64/2011: Managing Prisoner Safety in Custody. They were not able to identify in evidence the risk factors it was mandatory to consider for persons at risk of suicide or self-harm. They had not recorded triggers in the relevant section of the ACCT nor recorded all risk factors in the Caremap section. One ACCT case manager stated that they did not know whether it was necessary to record a trigger if action had been taken to mitigate it. They also stated they categorised risk based on ‘remaining’ risk after action had been taken despite having not recorded the trigger.
 
This leads me to have 2 concerns:
The first regards the provision and quality of ACCT training and refresher training given this evidence was given some 2 years after the death of Mr Huntley and well after the disruptions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic.
 
I also heard evidence that despite an ACCT being a ‘whole prison’ document (which can and should be opened by any member of staff) training was not mandatory for non-security staff.
In 2019 there was no joint training for prison and heathcare staff on the use of ACCT documents. I am informed by CNWL that under ACCT v6 (which has been in force since July 2021) joint training is provided for and this is reassuring. However I understand that the frequency of this training is determined in relation to operational capacity at individual establishment level. This is of concern given the evidence from witnesses at this inquest some 20 months after this version came into force.
 
The second relates to the quality and effectiveness of ACCT audits. We heard evidence that ACCT documents are reviewed annually. The case manager mentioned above advised that he had not received any adverse feedback about the quality of his ACCT documents and no issues with them had been identified. Given the inadequate nature of the ACCT document opened on Mr Huntley and apparent lack of understanding about completing the documents the quality of the audits is brought into question.
 
Information sharing.
In evidence it was clear that the ACCT document was the only written document used for sharing information between the healthcare staff employed by the NHS trust and the prison security staff. Healthcare staff record and share their information within SystemOne which the prison security staff do not have access to. Prison security staff record information within NOMIS which healthcare staff do not have access to.
 
Evidence from witnesses revealed that these information systems are not necessarily fully reviewed for relevant information prior to attending ACCT meetings.
 
In addition a decision relating to Mr Huntley’s care (i.e. the move to a different cell) was taken by healthcare staff at their own meeting when they did not have the benefit of information available to prison staff.
 
[REDACTED] of HMP Winchester informed me that a Safety Intervention Meeting was now carried out weekly, chaired by a Senior Governor and attended by representatives of the prison, physical and mental health care providers and the probation service. This meeting covers each person subject to an ACCT and any relevant information is share via the ACCT case manager, NOMIS and the multi disciplinary team. [REDACTED] could not assist me with whether this was a HMP Winchester initiative or had a wide application across the prison estate.
 
My concern is therefore that the current procedures and policies for sharing information are incomplete or not fully complied with. This renders the information on which separate teams make decisions about a prisoner incomplete and increases the risk that important factors are not considered.
 
Cells
At HMP Winchester within the area, considered and referred to by most healthcare and prison staff, as the ‘mental health’ cells there are 2 cells which are not equipped in a way to reduce the amount of available ligature points.
 
It was clear from the evidence of the healthcare staff at the MDT meeting on the 28/05/2020 that they did not consider the contents of the cell when deciding to move Mr Huntley to the ‘mental health cells’ simply due to the fact he was on an ACCT. I heard evidence that the policy of CNWL has now changed and that a cell move risk assessment must now be carried out and that there is now a revised ligature audit process. HMP Winchester informed me that there is now an annual ligature audit carried out in conjunction with the new healthcare provider at that establishment. In addition I was informed that all telephone points in the ‘mental health cells’ at HMP Winchester have now been removed and placed outside the cells. These are welcome developments.
 
However at inquest those representing the HMPPS could not inform me whether all telephone points within cells designed for use by those at risk of self harm across the prison estate had been removed. Nor was any evidence available as to what consideration had been given to reducing the risk of the telephone points by design of the points themselves or the manner of their installation. Those representing were invited to provide this information after the hearing but have not done so.
 
I am concerned that telephone points which provide a ligature point may remain within cells which prison and health care staff consider to be suitable for use by those at risk of self harm.
 
The final area of concern is the lack of certified Safer Cells at HMP Winchester. The inquest heard evidence that these had either never existed at HMP Winchester or had not done so for many years. The evidence from prison governors was that, generally speaking within the prison estate, they were not used or proved too hard to maintain to the certified standard. However certified Safer Cells are still referred to in PSI 64/2011 as a means of managing risk from ligatures. It was heard in evidence that HMP Winchester experience high levels of self-harm and suicide and yet it did not appear that consideration had been given recently to introducing these. Those representing the HMPSS at the were invited to provide information about the status and use of safer certified cells across the prison estate. No such information has been forthcoming.","On 02 June 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of Thomas Victor HUNTLEY (aged 54) who had died in HMP Winchester. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 05 April 2023.

His mother had risk factors – gestational diabetes, a congenital heart condition and heightened blood pressure. At 4 minutes of age Alfie was noted as “grunting”. At 03.55 observations were documented on the NEWTT chart. Two were in the amber category – respiratory rate of 72 rpm and Oxygen saturation of 88%. The Mother was concerned and there was cyanosis around the mouth and nose. Intermittent grunting was noticed. At a review noted up at 5am, having probably occurred at around 04.30, saturation was 89.93%. On re-testing with a monitor from the resuscitate it was found to be 97%. The assessment found that there were no other signs of respiratory distress. The evidence from the Trust has included that given the maternal risk factors, once the two amber category observation at 03.55 had been documented, antibiotics should immediately have been administered to Alfie on a pre-emptive basis. In the event antibiotics were not applied, nor was close monitoring implemented. Alfie’s temperature fluctuated. At 05.15 he was 37.5 degrees. By 14.00 he was 37 degrees. The fluctuation was to some extent influenced by environmental factors. He was noted as intermittently groaning at 06.30. There were complications with feeding. He underwent a tongue-tie procedure at 10.20. At 11.30 the complications were persisting. At around 16.45 Alfie was discharged home. He became increasingly unsettled, crying consistently. This worsened such that the parents called 999. Pre-alert to the Emergency Department of University Hospital of North Durham at 00.02 on 14 June 2022 stated that Alfie was in cardiac arrest. Despite intensive treatment, and a brief return of cardiac output at 00.40, Alfie declined and died at 01.50. The medical cause of death provided following postmortem was 1)a) severe congenital pneumonia and meningitis, b) suspected acute chorioamnionitis. Reflecting the concession in the evidence of the Trust witnesses, the omission of antibiotics from 03.55 on 13 June 2022 is more likely than not to have contributed directly to Alfie’s death and, but for this omission, he would not have died.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

22/11/2023,17/11/2023,2023-0457,Raymond Eggleton,David Ridley,Wiltshire and Swindon,Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths,Great Western Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust | Department of Health and Social Care,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/raymond-eggleton-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Raymond-Eggleton-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0457_Published.pdf,,"Having considered the evidence, I found the following facts in relation to the circumstances of Ray’s death.
 
Ray arrived late evening on the 16th January 2023 at the Emergency Department of the Great Western Hospital in Swindon. He had a history of 3 falls in the previous few days which following an examination was considered to be attributable to a condition called postural hypotension. This condition results in a sudden drop of blood pressure when somebody stands up and can cause dizziness even temporary unconsciousness. The treating clinicians view, in respect of which I agreed, was that the postural hypotension and general frailty likely caused Ray’s falls noted over the previous few days.
 
Ray was admitted the following day onto the Linnett Acute Medical Unit (LAMU) and a CT scan undertaken revealed evidence of chronic subdural haematomas, indicative of previous head trauma more likely than not attributable to earlier falls, not necessarily those falls in the last few days. In keeping with the hospital’s falls policy, following his arrival on LAMU, Charge Nurse [REDACTED] who was starting the night shift, carried out a falls risk assessment amongst other assessments. Relying on information that was passed to him verbally at the  shift handover before 8 o’clock that evening, he was however only told and therefore recorded as part of that falls risk assessment that Ray had had 1 fall in the last 12 months. Whilst recognising that there was a risk of a fall the assessment did not trigger any of the higher levels of monitoring over and above 1 hourly care rounding such as ensuring that Ray was within line of sight or more importantly was within arm’s reach of a care worker.
 
Whilst the plan was for hourly care rounding I noted that no such checks were made on Ray from 20:50 on 17th January 2023 until just after midnight on 18th January 2023, although it was not material in my view to the events that followed but was indicative as regards the working pressures faced by nursing staff on that shift.
 
At 00:45 on 18th  January  2023, Nurse [REDACTED] was called by another patient in the same bay as Ray and saw him stood next to his bed passing urine into a bottle. She recalls the night light was on and she could see him clearly. She observed him suddenly falling to the right not putting his hands out to break his fall and he fell hitting his head on the chair leg as he collapsed to the floor. Due to the postural hypotension Ray was being given IV fluids and this equipment was connected to his arm. I was not of the view that the equipment contributed to the fall and found as a fact that the fall more likely than not was attributable to Ray’s postural hypotension.
 
As a consequence of the fall, Ray was found to have suffered head trauma and in addition had fractured his right neck of femur in respect of which it was noted more likely than not it was an osteoporotic fracture. The fracture was repaired the following day on the 19th January 2023, however, Ray as a result of immobility and trauma sustained deteriorated and he began to develop swallowing issues. He also became generally more confused and ultimately, he developed an aspiration pneumonia from which sadly he died in The Great Western Hospital on the 25th January 2023.
 
During  the Inquest  hearing I heard live  evidence  from  Charge  Nurse [REDACTED] who came across as a conscientious and caring Nurse. That having been said I did ask probing questions
of Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  as regards the discrepancy between Ray’s pre-admission history and
what was actually  recorded  as part of the falls risk assessment.   By way of background,  I  was
told that  LAMU  consisted  of a ward  with  36 beds.   Back  in January  2023  those  beds  were
occupied by elderly patients. I was told following the arrival of a new Chief Nurse there had been improvements in relation to staffing levels and at the time of Ray’s fall Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  told
me that there was  1 Senior Nursing Sister in charge, 5 Registered Nurses of which he was one,
4 Health Care Assistants  and 2 enhanced Care Workers.    ","Falls in the hospital environment do happen and I am not saying that all can be avoided. That having been said what I have noted of late when dealing with these cases is an increase in the instances where as a result of my investigation, in relation to cases that I have been directly involved in, that I am making findings that more likely than not the falls could have been prevented and the injuries that were causative in relation to that individuals death, avoided.
 
Ray was a 96 year old gentleman who would have died had it not been for the fall at some point in the future. That may have been in a matter of weeks, months or even a few years but had it not been for the fall on the night of the 17th 18th January 2023 he would not have died as he did, in the circumstances that he did, on the 25th January 2023.
 
During the course of the Inquest, I also heard evidence from Sister Jones and in addition to the challenge of getting the staffing levels commensurate to the patients needs and safeguarding patients there does appear to be an issue that causes me a concern as regards the ability to dynamically respond to a need for enhanced supervision especially entering into night shifts. Sister Jones when questioned was open and extremely candid in her answer that at those times nursing staff could not always support those additional needs in the short term because of the challenge to get additional personnel at short notice in circumstances where the nursing team were under pressure due to the complexities and demands of patient’s needs. There is in my view no flexibility and resilience within the system to dynamically adapt and respond to changing patients enhanced needs exacerbated by the fact that especially during the winter months these beds are mainly occupied by the elderly. It is easier during day shifts to respond but  there clearly appears to be an issue especially going into night shifts.
 
There were 2 issues here, firstly the initial falls risk assessment on LAMU which was not undertaken  taking advantage  of all available  information  which in  my  view led to an  incorrect
assessment  of  Ray’s  supervision  needs.    His fall  was  observed  by  another  member  of the nursing staff and therefore my view was that only arm’s length supervision would have avoided the fall and that there were sufficient indicators to warrant this prior to the event occurring. The failure here in relation to the initial assessment was down to the volume of work and not in my view laziness or anything of that nature on the part of nursing staff.
 
Flowing from the first issue a further issue relates to the resilience and the ability to respond dynamically with changing patients on the ward so as to ensure that vulnerable patients with a high degree of risk of falling, like Ray, are properly safeguarded.
 
[REDACTED] in her evidence talked about an ongoing programme, the Enhanced Care Toolkit Framework, which I acknowledge is work in progress, in respect of which not only the family but also I am interested in hearing what steps the Trust intends to take to mitigate against a risk of further incidents occurring such as the fall that Ray had on the night of 17th/18th of January.
 
This report is also being sent to The Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care and the reason I have sent this to The Secretary of State is to highlight the issue and my concerns. Often when Regulation 28 Reports are submitted responses often come back from Government Departments as regards the increase in the amount of money that they are injecting into that particular public service. Coroners cannot  make recommendations but as we advance in time into yet another winter period, which will undoubtedly be challenging for frontline NHS personnel, combined with an ever-increasing elderly population whose care needs both physical and mental are more complicated and demanding, it is essential that when these vulnerable people come into the care of the state, that they are effectively safeguarded. I cannot see this winter being much different from last winter and at the moment and my concern is that potentially it could be worse. Whilst the focus of this report relates to a hospital environment, the challenges created by an increasing elderly population in terms of NHS and social care response affects those in the community as well. I do not believe that there is an easy fix for these issues when resources and budgets are stretched. The problem here undoubtedly is multi factorial but any solution here is one in respect of which the Government undoubtedly has a crucial role to play,
and I hope The Secretary of State understands why she is a recipient to this Regulation 28 Report.",On the 13th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raymond Lionel Eggleton and I opened an Inquest into his death on the same date.  On the 14th November 2023 I concluded Ray’s Inquest. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 12th January 2024.

He was initially treated in the Royal Free Hospital, London and then had an outpatient appointment at his local hospital of Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby, near to  where he lived, on 11.04.22.
 
Mark collapsed with a suspected pulmonary embolism causing a cardiac arrest in the Meadowhall Shopping Centre Sheffield on 14.04.22.
 
During evidence of [REDACTED] for the Yorkshire Ambulance Service (YAS) in the inquest on 19.09.23, it emerged that paramedics attempted resuscitation of Mark for only 21 minutes. This was just within their then applicable protocol. Rather than transport Mark to the nearby accident and Emergency Department of the Northern General Hospital Sheffield, they declared ROLE and no further attempts a resuscitation took place.
 
Concern was expressed that this meant that there was no opportunity for thrombolysis to be attempted by hospital staff . [REDACTED] of YAS gave evidence that the guidance and protocols available for ambulance staff/paramedics on when to stop resuscitation and/or take to hospital for attempts at thrombolysis in these circumstances were unclear.
 
I was concerned that this lack of clarity on what constituted best practice on this issue for paramedics and/or ambulance staff might place future patients at risk in similar situations","The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows:
 
I believe there is a lack of guidance and/or protocols on what constitutes best practice on this issue for paramedics and/or ambulance staff which might place future patients at risk in similar situations.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
Evidence heard from a Patient Safety Officer from the East of England Ambulance Service identified that, despite previous measures put in place, there are continuing and regular instances of non-availability of ambulances occurring in Suffolk and the wider East of England region.
 
These periods of non-availability (in this case of over 8 ½ hours) fall far short of the target attendance times set by the East of England Ambulance Trust itself.
 
Expert evidence from a Consultant Interventional Cardiologist, whose unit treats up to three thousand patients with serious cardiac issues such as Christopher’s each year, identified that had an ambulance for Christopher arrived within the target time, the drugs he could have been given by ambulance personnel, and his early transport to hospital, would on a balance of probabilities have saved his life.

Although not formally diagnosed with a mental health illness, at the time of their death clinicians were considering a working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. Madeleine had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both becoming acute in early February 2022. Madeleine was known to the Child and Young Persons Mental Health Service and to the Paediatric Ward at Ipswich Hospital. All organisations concerned with Madeleine’s care had knowledge of their history of suicidal ideation.
 
On the 3rd February 2022 Madeleine absconded undetected from their school and carried out an act of self-harm which resulted in their hospitalisation. They were subsequently identified as needing a Tier 4 Bed admission on a paediatric mental health ward. Measures were put in place for such a bed to be sourced. At the time of Madeleine’s death a bed was neither identified nor allocated to Madeleine.
 
During Madeleines admission on Bergholt Ward at Ipswich Hospital they were assessed as being a high risk of self-harm. Their mood fluctuated and on occasions Madeleine presented with no indication of either suffering from low mood or suicidal ideation.
Throughout this period of time Madeleine’s presentation was complex and reflected the working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. A risk assessment on the 12th February 2022 identified the need for additional measures in managing Madeleine’s risk which included mental health observations. These measures were ceased on or around the 14th February 2022. The rationale behind why these measures were ceased is unclear.
 
On the 19th February 2022, during the evening Bergholt Ward shift, Madeleine appeared settled and an earlier episode of distress during the day seemed to have no further impact on them. At around 22:05 pm Madeleine made their way to the bathroom securing the door behind them. They were not observed by ward staff entering the bathroom and there was a period of up to ten minutes during which Madeleine’s precise whereabouts was unknown. At around 22:20 pm the evening shift Nurse-in-Charge on Bergholt Ward was informed that Madeleine had been in the bathroom for at least ten minutes and was concerned that this period of time was longer than expected. Measures taken to rouse Madeleine by knocking on the door or calling out to them produced no response. Staff subsequently entered the bathroom and found that Madeleine had ligatured themself.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

10th November 2022 Mr Goodwin was struck by a train whilst walking along the railway track in the vicinity of Dalton-in-Furness Station. His death was confirmed at 00:17 on 11th November 2022. A post mortem examination has confirmed that Mr Goodwin had ingested a significant amount of alcohol prior to his death. It is more likely than not that he happened on to the railway track as a result of his dementia and alcohol consumption.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
(1)  The Liaison and Diversion of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust had contact with Mr Goodwin in September and October 2022. Liaison and Diversion Team members visited Mr Goodwin at home and concluded that he was at risk of self- neglect. They noted his appearance, his living conditions and the fact that he was not taking prescribed medication. On any view Mr Goodwin was vulnerable: he suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia, and was thought to misuse alcohol. The Liaison and Diversion Team considered that there were safeguarding concerns in respect of Mr Goodwin and referred him to the Adult Social Care team of Cumbria Council. I understand that the team in question now forms part of Westmorland and Furness Council. Despite this referral from practitioners who had personally visited Mr Goodwin, it was rejected at triage on 5th October 2022. I am concerned that this indicates that an approach to triage is being taken which pays insufficient regard to the concerns of practitioners who had personally witnessed apparent safeguarding concerns.
 
(2)  The witness statement on behalf of the Adult Social Care team explains that after the refusal to conduct a safeguarding enquiry, Mr Goodwin was nevertheless referred for the Social Work team to ‘engage’ with him. A social worker took steps to engage with Mr Goodwin and his family and concluded that a care assessment was appropriate. Despite
this the ‘Reablement Team’ referred the case for closure indicating that they did not consider that such an assessment was not required. I am concerned that this indicates further circumstances in which the needs of a vulnerable person might be overlooked. After a social worker considered that a care assessment was needed the Reablement Team appear to be able to come to an alternative view and close the case without further discussion or rationale. In another case this might lead to a vulnerable person being disregarded.
 
(3)  Fortunately, the Closure Team noticed that the Reablement Team were seeking to close a case in which another social worker had recommended a Care Assessment. They sent the case to the ‘Short Term Allocation Tray’. This should have resulted in a referral but that did not happen. I am concerned that in a future case a referral might not be generated and a person’s needs overlooked. The witness statement prepared by the Service Manager indicated ‘we are looking at a way of ensuring that notifications requiring an action are only acknowledged once the task is complete’. This indicates that such work has not yet borne fruit and the risk still exists.
 
(4)  Thereafter Mr Goodwin’s case was allocated and de-allocated to a social worker within the space of one day, without anything being done. It is said that there is no note or explanation for this. I am concerned that, once again, the ability of a case to be allocated and deallocated within a short period and without anything having been done may enable a case to ‘fall through the cracks’. Indeed, the referral for the care assessment was not ultimately actioned until 25th November 2022, 2 weeks after Mr Goodwin died.
 
(5)  More generally, it is striking how many different teams and systems appear to co-exist and require mutual communication and cross referencing. I am concerned that the above narrative demonstrates that those systems do not function effectively. I am concerned that this exposes other vulnerable adults to risk.","On    16    November    2022 I    commenced    an    investigation    into    the    death      of Gerald GOODWIN.

He underwent an endoscopy on 18 August 2022 where biopsies were taken. The results showed abnormal cells. On 15 September, Mr Di Blasi was referred by a GP to the Lower Gastro-intestinal team for possible bowel cancer and had a CT scan on 4 November 2022. The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the
report until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022. The incidental findings were not considered to be ‘significant’ by the Radiologists and were not therefore warrant an alert being sent to the referring clinician, leaving the report to be reviewed when they were able to. My investigation revealed that the timeframe for seeing patients on the cancer referral pathway is the date of the first appointment and there are no other target dates in respect of investigations of subsequent treatment.
 
Mr Di Blasi underwent a further endoscopy on 30 November 2022. The Endoscopist was unaware of these incidental findings. A biopsy was taken from an area which looked abnormal but was actually a gastric varix. As a result of this, Mr Di Blasi suffered a massive bleed and despite maximal supportive measures, he died on 1 December 2022 at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8HW.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
(1)  That one of the teams caring for Mr Di Blasi was completely unaware of the input from another specialty team, despite both referrals being made under the 2-week urgent referral pathway. The lack of communication between these teams meant that timely sharing of results did not occur. Even the very knowledge of the fact that a CT scan had taken place would have alerted the endoscopist to check those results, and it is likely that the second endoscopy would not have gone ahead. I understand this to be a national issue and is likely to apply to other investigations being carried out.
 
(2)  That the reporting timeframes on the 2-week urgent cancer pathway referral does not take into account timeframes for reporting investigative procedures or subsequent review by the referring clinicians.
 
(3)  The current training for Endoscopists for JAG certification requires the performance
of 200 endoscopies. However, these tend to focus on the clinician’s area of specialty and therefore there is a danger that lesion recognition will be limited and insufficient to ensure that endoscopists are able to recognise less frequently occurring lesions. With the need for an increasing number of endoscopists, action should be taken.",On 13th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Calogero Di Blasi. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15th November 2023.

Investigations identified a pelvic abscess and bowel obstruction as the source of sepsis which was not amenable to radiological drainage. He underwent an emergency laparotomy the same day with findings of a pelvic abscess from a perforated gangrenous appendix and non-viable adjacent colonic tissue and small bowel obstruction. This required drainage of the abscess, removal of the gangrenous tissue and bowel and formulation of a stoma. As part of the pre-surgical preparations for post operative care the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) was undertaken using the right subclavian vein. A landmark approach was used. There was no use of ultrasound to assist placement of the CVC despite this being available. As part of the checks to ensure correct placement of the CVC a check chest x-ray was undertaken. Other checks in the form of an arterial blood gas and transducing the intra-vessel pressure wave via the CVC were not undertaken even though the necessary equipment to do so was available. The check chest x-ray was incorrectly interpreted as showing correct placement into the vein whereas, in fact, the CVC had been incorrectly placed into the artery. The check chest x-ray was not reviewed by the consultant who had undertaken the procedure until a later point after discovery that the CVC had been incorrectly placed. Whilst the evidence identified incorrect placement of a CVC was a recognised complication, it was accepted that the various steps detailed above that would have reduced this happening were not undertaken.","During the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

1.    That Roger, as a vulnerable adult who had been recognised to be in need of care and support, had been lost in the system (e.g. with a lack of 72 hour follow up in 2021) and may have been inappropriately housed.
 
2.  There was a need for recognition of service users with cyclical chronic mental ill health issues – in this case being that help Roger received tended to be only at the time of crisis thus doing nothing to address long-term underlying chronic conditions.
 
3.  That there was a lack steps taken to address isolation felt by service users suffering ill health where there were likely to be substantial delays in accessing services (such as being allocated a care co-ordinator) and receiving treatment which could lead to further feelings of desperation leading to thoughts of suicide and self-harm.
 
4.    KMPT needed to ensure service users do receive a 72 hour follow up after presenting to an Emergency Department,

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
On 28 March 2023, Igor refused to get out of the shower [REDACTED]. Hostel staff took various actions, including calling the crisis team. The crisis team decided that Igor did not need daily visits, but told staff to call back if there was any change or further concern.
 
1.      On 14 April 2023, staff found Igor outside, drowsy and incoherent, cold and wet, but did not re-contact the crisis team.
 
2.      Igor was a vulnerable young man, recently homeless, but the last time that any member of staff had a meaningful conversation with him was on 20 April 2023, ten days before he died.
 
3.      The Depaul executive director of services recognised at inquest that there should have been more staff conversation with Igor throughout his time at the London Youth Hub.
 
4.      She also acknowledged that greater attempts should have been made by staff to engage with partner agencies regarding Igor’s care and welfare.
 
5.      Igor was only 18 years old and his father did visit him, but the hostel did not have any contact details for his family.
 
I heard evidence at inquest that Depaul conducted an internal investigation into Igor’s death. The fact of the report was not disclosed to my office in advance of the inquest as it should have been, and I did not see it until it was mentioned in evidence at the inquest.
 
However, I have read the report since.

I was told at inquest that staff were disciplined about this after Igor’s death.
 
At the time of Igor’s death, there was no national policy on when to increase welfare checks. I was told that there is now national guidance.
 
The Depaul investigation also identified that staff at the London Youth Hub had not attended self harm and suicide awareness training. I heard that training has now increased and is mandatory.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Initial referral – there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from an individual’s family at the point of referral and admission. An individual’s family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someone’s care.
 
Access to notes – the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual’s notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individual’s risk assessment and their subsequent care plan.",On 19 May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Richard ALLUM aged 36. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 November 2023.

She trained as a primary school teacher.
 
Lizzie began to suffer from anxiety and sleeping problems. Her mental health declined in 2019 causing her to become withdrawn from friends and work. In September 2022 it was agreed with her husband that their relationship was over and but they remained living in the same house by arrangement. On 3rd December 2022 there was a substantive argument. It was agreed that her husband would leave the house. The following day the couple talked. While the breakdown of the relationship was distressing it was believed that the situation had settled and decisions had been made. Lizzie appeared calm, she informed family members she would not be going to work the next day as she wanted to rest.

From March 2020 Lauren had been an in-patient, detained under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983. In January 21 Lauren was admitted to a Rehabilitation Unit, at The Priory, Dorking, as an Out-of Area patient. This placement was commissioned by Dorset CCG (as it was then – now Dorset ICB). Dorking is just over 100 miles from Bournemouth. In about mid-June 2021 Lauren’s mental health deteriorated and it was determined on 01.07.21 that Lauren needed to be transferred to a Psychiatric Intensive Care Unit to keep her safe.   ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Matter One
This is the second inquest I have heard where the delayed discharge/repatriation of an
Out-of-Area patient from an independent provider’s hospital has been a contributory factor in that patient’s death. Lauren was 20 years of age. The other inquest involved a 15 years old patient – 115 miles from home.
 
Both of these cases illustrate,
a)       Underfunding for local mental health beds.
b)       An over-reliance by the NHS on independent providers for mental health beds.
 
The Government set itself a target to eliminate inappropriate (which I infer would include delayed discharge) Out-of-Area in-patient placements in mental health services for adults by 2020-21.
 
Matter Two
The jury identified inadequate and insufficient communication between Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust, The Priory and relevant parties.
 
I heard evidence that Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust have appointed a designated Care Co-ordinator for its Out-of-Area patients. Having a single point of contact will alleviate some of the communication issues identified.
 
I heard evidence from The Priory as to some of the challenges it faces when dealing with the NHS commissioning bodies, be they Hospital Trusts or Integrated Care Boards. The Priory is just one of the several independent providers of mental health care.
1.        The Priory deals with 42 NHS separate commissioning bodies.
2.        There are multiple software programmes for record keeping for these organisations, which makes transfer and sharing of clinical information cumbersome and difficult, as direct sharing is not possible.
3.        These bodies have varying processes and requests for communication.
4.        There is no national standard process for referrals into the independent sector nor for discharge/repatriation to the ‘home team’.
 
With regard to delayed discharge/repatriation of an Out-of-Area patient I heard evidence that The Priory have devised a protocol/standing operating procedure in respect of delayed discharge, which should reduce the risks of a patient being left miles from home at all and in any event reduce the time taken to repatriate. However, it relies on the ‘home team’s’ engagement in the process. In brief, the protocol is as follows,
1.        Once it has been determined that a patient is ready for discharge/step- down/repatriation BUT no bed/placement is available that is a delayed discharge and the protocol is triggered.
2.        In week one The Priory MDT hold a professionals meeting to explore reasons for delay and together with the ‘home team’ identify SMART actions.
3.        If after 4 weeks there is limited progress The Priory MDT will request the ‘home team’ ICB to arrange a Care & Treatment Review.
4.        If there is, by then, no or little progress there should be discussions between the Priory Head of NHS Partnerships and the ‘home team’ Commissioning Managers.
5.        As a last resort: service of notice on the patient’s placement.
 
The protocol is heavily reliant on engagement from, and cooperation of, the numerous NHS commissioning bodies. The protocol requires a low threshold for the escalation of delays to the appropriate manager and/or commissioner at the ‘home service’.
 
There are over 60 independent providers for in-patient mental health services.
 
The initiative taken by The Priory is to be applauded but it is just one of many independent providers for some 42 separate NHS commissioning bodies. There is a clear danger that it will not be adopted by the other independent providers, indeed there is no reason for them to be aware of its existence. In  the premises, Out-of-Area  delayed discharge, and its detrimental effect on a patient’s mental health, will remain a matter of concern.
 
While there remains a shortage of local NHS mental beds and the Government remains committed to eliminating inappropriate Out-of-Area in-patient placements the development of protocols or standardised operating procedures to avoid delayed discharge, or limit the length of delay, is a clearly a matter for the NHS rather than the individual independent providers.","On 01.03.22 an investigation commenced into the death of Lauren Elizabeth Bridges who died on 26.02.22, aged 20 years.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
NHS England
Jack moved from Shropshire to Hampshire in the year leading up to his death. He had been under the care of the Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for many years in relation to his mental health difficulties and they held significant records. He was assessed as stable in 2019 when he moved to Hampshire and was discharged from their service. When Jack became unwell again neither the community mental health team nor the in-patient mental health team of Solent NHS Trust were able to access Jack’s records from the Midlands and a copy had to be requested. For a number of reasons this was not available prior to Jack’s death and this may have impacted the decision making ability of the staff caring for Jack.
I heard evidence that there is no systems or arrangements for the sharing of access to electronic medical records (such as SystmOne and RIO) outside of local areas and the Care and Health Information Exchange (CHIE) operating in the local area contains limited information.
 
I also received evidence that the new NHS England National Record Locator system only acts as a flag to show who holds records rather than allowing access to clinicians.
 
This fragmentation of patient records means that medical and mental health practitioners do not have quick access to relevant information about their patients. In Jack’s case he was detained under the Mental Health Act on New Years Eve and at the start of a bank holiday weekend. As such the staff of the mental health unit did not have any way to obtain his records during the out of hours period.
 
Solent NHS Trust
I am pleased to hear that since Jack’s death and the subsequent inquest Solent NHS Trust have updated their training and guidance to staff members who are escorting detained patients. Additionally they are introducing an alert system within SystmOne for patients at increased risk of absconding and/or self-harm.
 
There remain 2 areas of concern:
 
1. Handovers
I heard evidence that the staff within the secure mental health unit rely very heavily on information given at handovers at the start of a shift and they do not have time to review the patient records in detail. At the time of Jack’s death records of these handovers were not stored in the same way as other patient records and, in Jack’s case, were missing entirely. This significantly hampered the investigation and inquest.
 
I am pleased to hear that Solent NHS Trust have now changed their document storage policy in this regard and these records will now be added to and stored on SystmOne.
 
However the handover records are not currently completed within SystmOne. This gives rise to the continuing risk of this information not being correctly recorded or correctly stored. I understand that this requires a change to SystmOne which is not yet complete.",On 08 January 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jack FARRINGTON aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 July 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by November 09, 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Evidence heard from a Patient Safety Officer from the East of England Ambulance Service identified that, despite previous measures put in place, there are continuing and regular instances of non-availability of ambulances occurring in Suffolk and the wider East of England region.
 
These periods of non-availability (in this case nearly 10 hours) fall far short of the target attendance times set by the East of England Ambulance Trust itself.
 
Expert evidence from a Consultant Interventional Cardiologist, whose unit treats up to three thousand patients with serious cardiac issues such as Gina’s each year, identified that had an ambulance for Gina arrived within the target time, the drugs she could have been given by ambulance personnel, and her early transport to hospital, would on a balance of probabilities have saved her life.

He was 79 years old. He had fallen the morning before, at home, and had remained on the floor until admittance to the ED at approximately 05:32 on the 20th December 2022. He had made a first call to the East of England Ambulance Service at around 7:29 pm on the 19th December 2022. The call was allocated a C2 category which aims to have an urgent response within an 18 minute time frame. The EEAS was extremely busy that night with previously unseen levels of C2 allocations of ambulances. In addition, the hospitals in the area were queuing ambulances outside ED’s because they were unable to offload patients and then proceed to other calls. That combination meant that despite being allocated an urgent response time Mr Vincent was effectively left on the floor for a very prolonged time. Ultimately he had a cardiac arrest at home and an ambulance attended promptly. He was resuscitated but the “down time” was prolonged. He died as a result of a combination of an undiagnosed bronchopneumonia complicated by severe coronary artery disease and a long lie. On the balance of probabilities it is likely that had he been admitted at the time of the first call he would not have died at the time he did.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Mr Vincent had fallen many hours prior to making his first call to the ambulance service. There then followed a further ten hour delay, during which time he had a cardiac arrest, before he was admitted to the Emergency Department. He had been allocated an appropriate response time, expected within 18 minutes at 1929 on the 19th December 2022. For the reasons given in the circumstances above, that target was missed by an enormous margin. There is a strong possibility, even arguably a probability that another frail, elderly individual, will have the same experience. Long lie after a fall, especially in the elderly often results in a terminal kidney injury and death. Consideration should be given to review of how these types of emergency call are managed and thereafter monitored.",On 09 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John VINCENT aged 79.

The occupier of the private dwelling gave evidence that he and his wife were advised by the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust, during the course of the 999 call, to fetch a nearby community public access defibrillator from the Co-op store, 29 Doncaster Road, Carlton-in-Lindrick, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, S81 9JX.
 
The device was provided to the occupier by co-op staff. When the occupier arrived at Mackenzie’s side and opened the defibrillator pack, the audible instructions advised that the pads should be connected to the leads. On exploring the entirety of the device pack, it became apparent there were no pads, meaning the device could not be used. This delayed the use of a defibrillator, and the administration of a shock, if Mackenzie was in a shockable rhythm.
 
When the occupier later returned the device to the Co-op store, staff informed them that they knew the device was missing the pads because they had not been replaced since the device was last used.
 
I received evidence from East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust that responsibility for maintaining the defibrillator device and associated equipment, including replacement pads, rests with the “guardian” of the device, not with the with the ambulance service. The ambulance service simply has access to a list of the locations of community pubic access defibrillators and advise callers of their nearest device in a cardiac arrest scenario.
 
I understand there were other community access defibrillators very close by which the occupier could have accessed if the ambulance service had known the device in the co-op store was “offline”.
 
I understand there is no single database listing the location and status of community public access defibrillators, rather a number of charity organisations provide such a service (NDDb and the British Heart Foundation) and I am unclear how the ambulance service are to know when a listed device is non-functional.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern) Central England Co-operative
1.     The community public access defibrillator in your store was supplied to a member of the public in a non-workable condition. There appears to be either no system for replacing the pads between uses, or an unsafe system in operation.
2.     There appears to be either a training or communication issue in that staff appear to have known the device was missing vital equipment, but the device was supplied anyway.
 
The Department for Health and Social Care
 
3.     In December 2022, the Government committed to making available over £1 million for the purchase of more community public access defibrillators, in recognition of the fact that these devices have the potential to save lives. I am concerned that without a clear system for ensuring (a) the maintenance and good order of all community public access defibrillators, and (b) a system for sharing with all ambulance Trusts the current status of defibrillators i.e. when they are out of service due to missing parts/maintenance, members of the public might be directed to a device that cannot
be used, as in this case.","On 17 October 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mackenzie COOPER, aged 27.

Unfortunately her cognitive impairment meant that her behaviours put others at serious risk of harm and/or death (she is recorded as having tried to suffocate another resident with a pillow) and so her previous home had identified that they could no longer meet her needs and sought to find another appropriate placement for her due to being unable to manage her unpredictable aggression and ‘assaults’ on other vulnerable residents.   ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I am concerned following the evidence presented to the Inquest that:
 
(i)   Frome Nursing Home employs clinically trained staff who would have been well aware (or should have been well aware) of the risk of developing DVT in an immobile patient and yet:
(a)   Did not make any enquiries with the discharging hospital as to her care needs and lack of thromboprophylaxis. Despite appropriate medical/clinical knowledge the Home did not question this and/or take any active steps whatsoever to ascertain Mrs White’s needs or treatment plan;
(b)   Did not take any steps to acquire any TED stockings, or similar, to minimise the risk of a DVT;
(c)   Did not take any steps to mobile Mrs White, over and above repositioning her in bed every four hours, to minimise the risk of a DVT
(ii)  Frome Nursing Home did not have a DVT Policy in place at the time of Mrs White’s death, and no such active policy was in place at the time of the Inquest and so I am concerned that there has been no active learning and/or meaningful reflection since Mrs White’s death; meaning that practices have not changed and vulnerable residents remain at risk.
 
I am concerned that the Home did not take appropriate and reasonable steps to identify her risk and then take such steps to minimise it. The overwhelming thrust of the evidence presented indicated a poor attitude to a joined-up and cohesive response from the management and clinical teams and this resulted in a lack of clinical leadership, judgment and action being taken.
 
Mrs White lacked capacity due to her cognitive impairment and so was unable to appreciate the risks that immobility posed to her. She was entirely reliant (because of age, cognitive impairment and general infirmity) on the Home to anticipate her risks and needs in this regard.","On the 20th of October 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Irene Joy White, aged 77. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 1st of November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was ‘The deceased died of a pulmonary embolous which developed on a background of early discontinuation of thromboprophylaxis and immobility following a fall and fixation operation” with the medical cause of [REDACTED] death being given as: 
Ia) Saddle Pulmonary Embolous 
Ib) Deep Vein Thrombosis 
Ic) Immobility 
II) Fractured neck of femur (operated on in June 2022)",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 2nd January 2024.

Mr Gale was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was seen regularly by mental health professionals and was in frequent contact with mental health services. Those services were provided by Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Gale was compliant with his medication and engaged with services. He was well supported by his family and friends.
 
Mr Gale’s anxiety continued during his engagement with mental health services. Evidence was heard about what caused Mr Gale’s anxiety. One ongoing feature was his application for Universal Credit.
 
On 2 March 2023, 2 days before his death, Mr Gale was seen by an Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the inquest. The Psychiatrist considered Mr Gale’s anxiety was exacerbated by his application for Universal Credit. During Mr Gale’s appointment, the Psychiatrist called the benefits office for help but the call was not answered before the end of the consultation. Mr Gale was expecting a call from a DWP representative the next day (3 March).
 
On 3 March 2022 at approximately 11:00 am, Mr Gale spoke to the duty Registered Mental Health Nurse. He remained very anxious and his main concern was the application for Universal Credit.
 
During their evidence, the Associate Specialist Psychiatrist expressed concerns about the experience of mental health service users with DWP. These concerns were not just specific to Mr Gale.
 
Evidence was also given by the Trust’s Group Nurse Director (a Registered Mental Health Nurse) who considered that the issues identified by the Psychiatrist were national. The Director considered it important to address these issues as they were debilitating for service users.
 
The Director advised that the Trust’s Crisis Team had started a food bank 3 years ago to support service users. The Director was also aware that the DWP had been invited to the Cumbria Suicide Prevention Group.
 
I stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Gale’s death and his anxiety about his Universal Credit application. DWP was not an Interested Person in Mr Gale’s inquest and did not give evidence as the concerns raised did not come to light until the hearing.","The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms. I heard evidence that:
 
1.     The number of and length of DWP forms required to be completed can be overwhelming for someone with a mental health illness. This is perpetuated if the applicant cannot get help to complete the paperwork.
2.     There are long telephone queues to speak to a DWP advisor.
3.     Having to travel long distances for appointments can be detrimental for those with a mental health illness.","Mr Kevin Conrad GALE died on 4 March 2022 at his home address.

She had suffered a stroke in 2016 and her condition had progressively worsened due to dementia. Mrs Burcham was incapable of doing anything for herself and she relied on the staff at the Nursing Home to anticipate and meet her every need and provide her with full care, including; personal care, hoisting, transfer, nutrition etc. She also lacked capacity and could only communicate through incoherent mumbling and facial expressions, which the staff who knew her well at the home had learned to interpret.
 
The Home is a residential and nursing home which, whilst accepting patients with dementia, is not a dementia specialist service.
 
On the 14th of December 2022 the Home had organised a carol concert in the communal lounge as part of their Christmas celebrations. It was attended by residents and their families, staff and church volunteers.
 
Mrs Burcham was brought to the lounge and hoisted into a standard riser- recliner chair. As she lacked any ability to support her own posture she was wedged in with pillows and the chair legs elevated by staff (via the remote control) to prevent her from slipping out. Carers then went to assist other residents to access the lounge ahead of the concert starting.
 
The riser recliner chair that Mrs Burcham was in appeared to be a fairly standard design; an electric chair plugged in at the mains to enable the mechanism via a remote control, which is attached to the chair via a cord, with a side pocket for storage of the remote control whilst it is not in use.
 
Whilst Mrs Burcham was in the riser-recliner chair unattended, another resident of the Home has accessed the remote control for the chair. This other resident had dementia which manifested itself in a compulsion to randomly fiddle. The other resident fiddled with the remote control buttons as they were accessible, unlocked and unsupervised and, without any intention or malice (or indeed any appreciation whatsoever of what she had done, because of her own cognitive impairment) managed to elevate the chair to its full rise position and tip Mrs Burcham onto the floor. Mrs Burcham had no power of speech to call for help, nor was she able to support her own weight or break her fall. She landed on her head and sustained a severe bleed on the brain, sadly dying of her injuries ten days later.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I am concerned that these chairs are common place in care home settings where residents suffer from cognitive impairment. The risks of another resident with dementia accessing the controls of the riser-recliner chair(s) was not foreseen by the Home and so was not factored into any operative risk assessment at the time; hence no measures were in place to minimise the risk. There remains a real and immediate risk that those with a cognitive impairment that manifests itself in a compulsion to fiddle and/or press buttons, can create a risk of death to other residents in the same care facility or setting. If this particular care home group did not foresee the risk then it is likely that others
have not foreseen it either.","On the 28th of December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Evelyn Ann Burcham, aged 96.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The accounts detailing Christopher’s decline over the course of a week; from a young, fit, engaging and polite gentleman, to a man who could not speak, eat, or properly stand, were harrowing for all to hear, not least his family. These accounts were supported by CCTV footage demonstrating Christopher’s extreme vulnerability on account of his acute ill health.
 
I remain unable to comprehend how, in the face of Christopher’s clear need for urgent medical assistance, this was not facilitated for him by those charged with the responsibility for his care, at a time when Christopher was unable through illness to ask for help. This was a clear case of the most serious neglect contributing to Christopher’ tragic death.
 
1.       An inability to provide prisoners at HMP Lowdham Grange with safe clinical care
 
I heard evidence, and the jury reached findings, that there was an unsafe practice of staff conducting important healthcare and wellbeing observations via the cell door observation hatch. Observing an unwell prisoner through a hatch slightly larger than a letterbox undermines the safety of the clinical assessment.
 
Healthcare staff did not utilise the NEWS2 system of monitoring the condition of an acutely unwell prisoner, despite the Trust having adopted this recognised healthcare tool many years prior. The Forensic Directorate has continued to lag behind other areas of the Trust where NEWS2 is fully embedded and this has previously been identified as an issue linked to other deaths.
 
There was a lack of robust GP visits, despite such being mandated by the Prison Rules. When visits did take place, they were often via the cell door observation hatch and conducted as “fleeting glances” rather than robust clinical assessments. Again, this is unsafe.
 
There was a lack of effective leadership of the healthcare department to ensure that staff had created a safe plan of care for Christopher. Senior personnel were not aware of Christopher’s week-long deterioration in the segregation unit until very late in the chronology of events, nor were they aware of a dispute between the mental health and physical health teams as to the differential diagnoses that might be causing his concerning symptoms and deterioration. Despite daily lunch time meetings, there was a stark lack of professional curiosity from senior staff as to the plan of care for Christopher and what safety netting, if any, was in place.
 
2. An inability to record, retain and supply HM Coroner with material relevant to the inquest
 
The progress of this inquest, taking places years after Christopher’s death, was halted many times due to the late disclosure of material relevant to the inquest. Policies and procedures said to exist at the time were produced mid-hearing.
 
Despite the Trust having conducted their own review of the case, being provided with ample notice of the inquest hearing, and having attended multiple pre-inquest review hearings, there was an inability to identify key material and to supply that to the court in good time.
 
The ability to reflect on the care provided in advance of a prisoner’s death is dependant on the Trust’s ability to isolate the relevant evidence, and to analyse it. Without the appropriate professional curiosity to understand exactly what happened, the Trust will repeatedly miss opportunities to learn from deaths and to take action to seek to prevent future deaths.","On 06 June 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Howard SMITH. The investigation concluded at the end of an Article 2 compliant inquest, conducted before a jury, between 12 December 2022 and 19 January 2023. The conclusion of the jury was that:   Christopher Howard Smith, was a 35-year-old gentleman who was a serving prisoner at HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire. Christopher died on the 19th of May 2019, at Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, from a cardiac arrest, due to a massive Pulmonary Embolism, predisposed by Deep Vein Thrombosis. In spite of prolonged efforts to resuscitate him, Christopher passed away. He had a severe and enduring Mental Health condition known as Schizo-affective disorder which was controlled with anti-psychotic medication (Promethazine and Olanzapine).   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by September 26, 2023.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I heard evidence at inquest that Mr Bailey was a (very recently ex) smoker with a family history of ischaemic heart disease – his brother had had two cardiac stents placed in 2006 and two in 2012.
 
However, it does not appear that these two pieces of information were elicited by those assessing Mr Bailey in the emergency department of Northwick Park Hospital. I heard evidence that, if they had been, he should have been referred to the rapid access chest pain clinic.
 
Given the sequence of events, it seems unlikely that such a referral would have resulted in definitive treatment before Mr Bailey’s fatal myocardial infarction, but it could be a life saving referral for another patient in Mr Bailey’s position.","On 18 May 2023, one of my assistant coroners, Edwin Buckett, commenced an investigation into the death of Trevor Bailey aged 63 years.

During this procedure, his external iliac artery was transected, resulting in a major haemorrhage. An off-duty vascular surgeon attended and was able to place a graft to bypass the damage to the artery. Mr Barnes was transferred to Royal Berkshire Hospital that afternoon.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The focus of my concerns relates to the approach of your Trust to learning from deaths. Although Mr Barnes was not treated at the John Radcliffe Hospital, I concluded that he should have been transferred there, and that the delay in carrying out vascular surgery there contributed to his death. The Oxford Trust has been involved in this investigation almost from the start, and other Interested Persons involved in the investigation have attempted to work with your Trust to investigate the circumstances of Mr Barnes’ death.
 
I have been assisted by investigation reports and statements from the Spire Dunedin Hospital, and Royal Berkshire Hospital. This, I am afraid, sits in stark contrast to the response and approach by the Oxford Trust.
 
The Oxford Trust has carried out no investigation. They did not co-operate with the offer to conduct a joint investigation with Royal Berkshire Hospital.
 
There is no recorded morbidity and mortality meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.
 
There is no recorded MDT meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.
 
There is no evidence of proposed changes beyond evidence in court during the inquest that “we are looking into this”. Whilst I accept entirely that a knee-jerk response, even following a tragic death, is not appropriate, it is now some 18 months since Mr Barnes’ death.
 
Evidence from RBH and Spire Dunedin was consistent, namely that attempts to liaise with your trust and learn from this event jointly have been universally ignored.
 
It was also difficult for my office to obtain evidence for the inquest. We were provided with a joint statement, from three consultant vascular surgeons (only two of whom were clinically involved). It transpired that this statement was written by a clinical governance manager, and each of the witnesses who gave evidence was careful to tell the court that they did not agree with the wording of that statement. We subsequently received a statement from the consultant vascular surgeon in this case on the 29th of September, and from the clinical lead of vascular surgery some 5 days before the inquest started. We were also informed 11 days before the inquest started that the key vascular surgery witness would be on holiday abroad. This witness was summonsed in May 2023. He ultimately gave evidence by video link, but this was difficult technically, and arrangements would have been made for him to attend in person, had we been made aware of this holiday arrangement, even aside from the fact that he had been formally summonsed.","I have on occasion referred to the deceased as Barney. This is in order to reflect the family’s wishes.   I conducted an inquest into the death of Francis Osborne Barnes, which concluded on 19th October 2023.

She presented to Coventry GP Walk-in Centre (operated by Virgin Care) at 2pm on 16 January 2017 with her parents, having suffered from fever and vomiting that morning. A receptionist took down details of her illness and recorded that Vanessa looked ‘pale’. The information recorded did not meet the ‘red or yellow flag’ conditions which would have prompted prioritisation of her care.   ","During the course of these inquests the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Miss Ferkova’s death were as set out in the attached Prevention of Future Death Reports which I addressed to NHS England and the Care Quality Commission (CQC).
 
I did not write to Virgin Care at that time, as they were to undertake a review as to whether ‘initial’ clinical observations should be introduced by their service. This review concluded that ‘…there is not evidence to support such an intervention currently…’
 
I was provided with responses from NHS England and the CQC (also attached) which demonstrated an intention to introduce new standards for facilities, such as the Coventry Walk-in Centre (which will be called Urgent Treatment Centres (UTC)). One such standard will include clinical assessment within 15 minutes of attending a UTC.
 
NHS England set out that all UTCs will be expected to have a plan in place by March 2019 and will be operational by 2019. The CQC set out a change to their inspection framework which would include a recommendation for patients to receive a clinical assessment within 15 minutes. This was stated to ‘go live’ from 1 April 2018.
 
However, in response to this issue Virgin Care, through its representative, set out as follows:
 
“The onus is for the commissioners (the relevant CCG) , rather than the providers (eg Virgin Care), to take (sic) ensure that the appropriate service is being commissioned. We understand that the local commissioners are reviewing the provision of urgent care services in the community. We trust that such a review will include the revised NHS
England guidance.”
 
1.  I am concerned that this standard is being introduced to address clinical risks but Virgin Care do not intend to change their service to address this risk but are instead awaiting a change in their commissioning arrangements. I am concerned that future deaths could arise in this circumstance.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Mrs Daniel’s death are related to the initial assessment/registration/non-clinical ‘triage’ process operated by Virgin Care.
 
2.  I am concerned that some information provided by Mrs Daniel’s family was not
transcribed by the reception team, meaning that it was not available in written form to the clinical team as part of the initial ‘paper’ triage process and at the later formal consultation.
 
3.  Related to this, I am also concerned that an important part of the medical records (the handwritten form completed by patients/families on registration) is destroyed, rather than added to the notes. The fact that information provided directly by patients/families is not available to clinicians is one issue that arises, another is that review of incidents, such as Mrs Daniel’s death is hampered where ‘primary evidence’ is unavailable.
 
4.  My final specific concern relates to the process whereby patients/families are asked to let the reception team know if the patient is deteriorating, or if they are concerned that earlier prompt review is required. I heard evidence that such concerns were raised but no action was taken. This seemingly runs counter to Virgin Care’s own ‘flagging’ system.
 
My overarching concern is that the current process of initial
assessment/registration/non-clinical ‘triage’ and yellow/red flags is unsafe. Future deaths may result, prior to the planned compulsory introduction of clinical assessment in 2019, if action is not taken either by Virgin Care directly, or by the CCG.",,,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 20 August 2018.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Whilst the jury did not make any finding of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in this case, much evidence was heard about the training in identification of the signs and symptoms. National training of police officers on the identification of ABD is focused on a triad of warning flags being, hot to touch, exhibiting constant or near constant activity and extreme agitation or aggression. Some evidence identified that Carl Fullalove did not exhibit these triad symptoms but did exhibit other nuanced symptoms in the long list delivered in training. It was evident that his symptoms were not recognised as ABD due to drug intoxication, and that the consequential risks associated with prone restraint were not therefore considered. Prone restraint ultimately led to his death. There were six experts providing evidence to the inquest two of whom identified that Carl would not have died had he been recognised as unwell at the point of arrest and assessed by a health care practitioner. Such attention would have provided a calming intervention for his heart rate and breathing prior to being placed in prone restraint, which exerted additional pressure on his ability to breath freely.
 
A research paper before the inquest, namely ‘Consensus on Acute Behavioural Disturbance in the UK, September 2023 recommends that the focus remain on the triad of warning signs. ABD is clearly difficult to distinguish from drug intoxication by a non-medical practitioner. The rigidity of the training with focus on specific symptoms can cause police officers to miss other signs. The Superintendent, and head of ‘Protecting Vulnerable People’ for Cheshire accepted that with hindsight the use of prone restraint was inadvisable in this case.
 
Significant training on ABD had been delivered by Cheshire Constabulary through the College of Policing Personal Safety Training package module, the key to which was to identify an underlying medical condition to refer to a health care practitioner. That may be a lot to expect of police officers in a dynamic fast paced setting. The use of the term ABD may be a distraction.
 
The effect of stimulant drugs and the need for calming de-escalation in an upright position, rather than prone restraint, had not been noted in either the training material or the research paper presented to the Court. This is on the background of recognising from College of Policing guidance that a high percentage of deaths in prone restraint are in drug related cases.
 
The First Aid Learning Programme (FALP) will be in place within Forces by April 2024 and includes amongst other things positional asphyxia, unconscious and not breathing, and ABD but does not mention training in calming intervention that on balance of probabilities may have led to a different outcome in this case.",On 04 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carl FULLALOVE aged 29.

None of the group had previous experience of coasteering. Mr Farrell was not a confident swimmer. The group was led by a single  experienced  freelance coasteering guide, [REDACTED], working for Land and Wave, a local outdoor activities provider.
 
Hedbury Quarry is a remote location off the South West Coast Path. It is approximately a 20 minute walk from the nearest carpark. It is known that there is no phone signal along this particular stretch of the coastline.
 
The guide was equipped with safety items, including a floating rope. In a “safety bag”, which was left in a central location on the coasteering route, was further safety equipment, including a VHF radio.
 
The sea state on 26th May 2019 was challenging at the start of the session and this became worse as the session progressed.
 
At the start of the session the coasteering group were asked to jump into the water from a sea ledge, assisted by the coasteering guide. They were instructed to swim away from the rocks and form a safety raft, before swimming in a westerly direction. During the swim, Mr Farrell became breathless and exhausted. The guide stayed with Mr Farrell to encourage and support him and subsequently made the decision to lead Mr Farrell to the shore with a view to getting him out of the water and cancelling the session. The rest of the group were instructed to form a safety raft and remain in the sea.
 
The guide used a length of “floating rope” to tow Mr Farrell to a sea ledge from which they would both be able to leave the coastline. However, once Mr Farrell had managed to climb onto the ledge with the guide, both were swept back into the sea by a large wave. It is likely that, at this point, Mr Farrell inhaled sufficient sea water to begin the process of drowning. Minutes later he became unresponsive in the sea.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1.     During the inquest evidence was heard that:

On being woken from the anaesthetic it was immediately apparent that Tracy had sustained serious brain injury. She died in hospital on the 19th of November 2016.

It appears that only during the course of Inquest proceedings did the issue relating to the lost referral become known to the Health Board. Even once it became known to them in 2022 there was still no investigation undertaken. It is not understood at all which incidents that occur are to be investigated. I have issued a number of Prevention of Future Death Reports relating to investigations and governance and yet these concerns continue. I am not in any way satisfied that improvements have occurred.
 
b.  Given that no investigation was conducted to understand how the issue may have occurred there has been no learning, change or improvement to ensure it is not repeated. I have been provided with no assurances in this regard.
 
c.  There was no evidence that any audits had taken place to review whether any other patients’ referrals had become ‘lost’.
 
d.  Matters relating to the ERCP which did not take place were identified by the Medical Examiners in their report dated 4 days after the deceased’s death. There was no evidence as to whether the Health Board had been made aware of the concerns therein and if so, what action they had undertaken as a result.",On 3 March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jennifer Lydia Campbell (DOB 612/6/48) who died on 24 February 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 October 2023. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 19 December 2023. I, Kate Robertson, the Coroner, may extend the period.

By the 31st most of his skin was red so he presented to the North Middlesex Hospital A&E where he was admitted by the medical team. He also had neutropenia and lymphadenopathy.The admitting doctor prescribed tazocin, a rare side effect of which is Stephens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) / Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN.) The North Middlesex outsources dermatology. Mr. Carr first saw a dermatologist 3 days after admission at which point there was no sign of SJS / TEN. Nevertheless skin biopsy – something every consultant dermatologist can do – was deemed necessary but the attendant dermatologist, who could have done this, did not becaue the company’s process is to ask a plastic surgeon to biopsy. It took until the 8th for the biopsy to be taken. There was no dermatological oversight of Mr Carr’s skin in the intervening
time. The biopsy found evidence of drug reaction consistent with SJS. An optimum dermatology service was described by our expert as patients being seen by a consultant dermatologist and biopsied if required within 24 hours of presentation, and then watched like a hawk on a daily basis. Had this happened the emergence of SJS may have been recognised and prompted withdrawal of the culprit medication. That this level of dermatological support was not available denied Mr. Carr ‘a role of the dice’ – a chance of survival.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She presented with a headache and vomiting which had started two days previously. She was prescribed antibiotics for a suspected infection. It is probable that the symptoms were due to a subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a burst aneurysm. A hospital referral at this point would probably have identified the subarachnoid haemorrhage and allowed preventative treatment to reduce the risk of her developing severe vasospasm. On 2nd April 2023 an ambulance was called as she was feeling unwell. The ambulance crew did not recognise that her behaviour was inconsistent with her usual presentation. She was taken to Tameside General Hospital where there was a prolonged wait to be seen. A CT scan undertaken showed evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage that had occurred previously around 28th March 2023. The scan was incorrectly reported as being clear. At Tameside General Hospital her consciousness levels were reduced, and she was agitated. She had probably developed a severe vasospasm from the subarachnoid haemorrhage. Treatment options at this point are extremely limited. An MRI scan on 5th April 2023 showed multi territorial infarctions and significant narrowing of all the intracranial vessels. On the balance of probabilities, the neurological situation was probably irreversible on her admission to Tameside General Hospital. She was transferred to Salford Royal Hospital where attempts to treat her were unsuccessful.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1.     The concerns within the hospital and non-compliance with the LRCP protocol has been addressed by way of an investigation & action plan.
 
2.     The nurse at the practice told the Inquest, the procedure for practice staff calling 999 (not leaving it to the patient) in the event of a patient with chest pain and other life threatening conditions applied only to reception staff and not to nursing staff. This led to inconsistency and in this case an avoidable delay in summoning urgent medical assistance and needs reviewing/all staff working in/working on behalf of the practice need to be aware of the procedure to be followed, consideration must be given as to whether it is appropriate to have different standards for qualified nursing and administrative/non qualified nursing staff. The awareness of Dissecting Aortic Aneurysm and the rapidity at which the condition can become catastrophic/fatal also needs raising within the practice.
 
The nurse within the practice who spoke with Wayne on the date of his death on behalf of the practice , did not escalate to a doctor, did not call 999, she did not inform the NOK of her concerns, she did not call back to see if Wayne had called for an ambulance/attended hospital and she did not alert the hospital of her suspicions
i.e. differential diagnoses including; PE, cardiac related problem or aortic aneurysm. The GP to whom this regulation 28 (Prevention of Future death) report is addressed informed the court (in a witness statement) no action had been taken within the practice since these events.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by December 14, 2023.

He was looked after at home by his wife. Following his admission to hospital he had to be placed urgently in a nursing home, as he was not safe to remain at home. A place was found for him at Kings Park Nursing Home. On 23rd May 2022 he was pushed by another resident who lacked capacity due to dementia. He fell as a consequence of the push and was admitted to the hospital where a fracture to the neck of femur was found. The other resident had a history of aggressive behaviour to others not known to the manager of Kings Park. On the balance of probabilities had that history been known the home would not have accepted that resident. Mr Davenport was operated on. Post-operatively he did not regain mobility and he declined nutritionally. This was probably as a consequence of the impact of the fall, fracture and operation on his cognition. He remained in an acute hospital setting after he was medically fit for discharge as a suitable care placement needed to be found for him. He continued to decline in the acute setting which was a difficult setting for him given his severe dementia. He was moved on to end of life care whilst awaiting discharge.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1.   The inquest heard evidence that the acute hospital setting was difficult for Mr Davenport due to his dementia and created risks to his health once he was medically optimised. He had to remain there due to a lack of suitable care/nursing beds. This meant that he was in an unsuitable care setting and that a bed that could have been utilised for an acute patient was not available;
 
2.  The inquest was told that resident who pushed Mr Davenport was not suitable for placement at the care home where the incident happened. The care home where previous incidents had occurred was out of area. The inquest was told that lack of information sharing between two GM local authorities, the care homes involved and GMP meant that the safeguarding issue was not recognised. It was unclear if this was due to an effective information sharing protocol not existing between local authorities/care homes/GMP in Greater Manchester or it not being adhered to. However, the impact was that the risk of harm was not understood, and staff and residents were put at risk.",On 29th September 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Terence Davenport.

Ms Twinn had a congenital heart defect which resulted in a further condition, Eisenmenger syndrome which adversely affected her respiratory output. Ms Twinn was also assessed to be affected by a severe learning disability.
 
On 15th December Ms Twinn became unwell with symptoms of; a productive cough with yellow sputum, sickness and diarrhoea. Her family took Ms Twinn to the emergency department of Newham General Hospital.
 
An initial rapid assessment identified low oxygen saturations at 61% she was treated with oxygen.
 
Clinical observations were taken and the patient was monitored, blood tests could not be taken as Ms Twinn had a significant phobia of needles. Her learning disability meant that she could not be persuaded to voluntarily provide a blood sample. Similarly, any assessment of potential confusion was made more difficult due to her non-verbal status.
 
It was decided that a blood sample or 1/V therapy could only be administered if the patient was sedated. Ms Twinn’s complex lung and heart problems meant sedation would carry high risk and was therefore discounted.
 
Ms Twinn had continuous monitoring of oxygen levels, blood pressure and heart rate. A chest x-ray was undertaken that was interpreted by the emergency team as inconclusive of infection despite that, based on history, chest auscultation and a raised temperature, a working diagnosis of bilateral pneumonia was arrived at.
 
A senior doctor took over care of the patient. Oxygen requirement was titrated down from high flow oxygen mask to low flow nasal cannula. Achieving saturations 75% at rest without oxygen, this was patients baseline level from medical notes.
 
Ms Twinn was discharged late in the evening on oral antibiotics, she was found deceased the following morning when her family tried to rouse her from sleep.
 
The Trust now accepts that the more appropriate course would have been to admit Ms Twinn for observation, monitoring of oxygen levels and providing remedial oxygen therapy if a de-saturation occurred.
 
The inquest took expert evidence into account in determining that an admission into hospital would not have, on the balance of probability, resulted in Ms Twinn’s death being avoided.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1.    Ms Twinn’s disability played a role in the provision of sub-optimal care, reasonable adjustment was not made for; her inability to communicate clearly and her impaired respiratory function when arriving at clinical decisions.
2.    Neither the trust decision to discharge Ms Twinn and not admit for continued monitoring of oxygen levels and remedial oxygen therapy, nor clear safety-netting advice to carers was recorded in the clinical record.
 
3.    Ms Twinn’s treatment did not involve any specialised learning disability nursing inp1 to facilitate clear communication with Ms Twinn.
 
4.    A radiological report of the chest x-ray taken on 15th December 2023 was not reported until 25th December 2023.","On 16 December 2022 this Court commenced an investigation into the death of Claire Twin aged 47.

I understand that concerns were raised with the General Dental Council (GDC) in relation to his dental work and fitness to practise as a dentist, and that such concerns were being investigated.
 
His case was referred to the Interim Orders Committee by the Registrar of the GDC on 4 August 2022. This led to a initial hearing taking place on 13th September 2022. The IOC decision was that interim conditions be placed on Mr Lall’s ability to practise for a period of 18 months, and a 7 page report being published on the GDC website. Within that report the complaints/concerns regarding Mr Lall’s working practices were set out in detail.
 
There was evidence provided by the Family that Mr Lall’s mental health, affected by the GDC investigation in the first instance, then deteriorated after the detail of the complaints/concerns of his work practices entered the public domain via the GDC Website.
 
In November 2022 Mr Lall was formally dismissed from his employment. In December 2022 he approached his GP reporting anxiety and depression with fleeting thoughts of suicide since the loss of his job and the fitness to practice enquiries.
 
On Friday 12th May and again on Monday 15th May 2023, Mr Lall received email notifications from his legal team regarding an upcoming meeting with the said team and the GDC scheduled for 18th May 2023. [REDACTED]. He died of suspension.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. ha
 
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Whilst it is accepted that the public should have knowledge of concerns raised with regards to a registered dental practitioner, my concern is regarding the level of detail placed on the GDC website in respect of those concerns, particularly when a case is at a stage where the proceedings have not been concluded and the issues not yet determined one way or another. In this case the report ran to 7 pages and set out in detail the allegations made under the ‘background section’ and then further detail of the allegations by way of documenting the submissions made by the Counsel acting on behalf of the GDC.
 
Whilst I accept that the report states in its preamble that “It is not the role of the IOC to make findings of fact in relation to any charge” the report detailed significant allegations, (which Mr Lall contested) which were undetermined by the GDC at that time. The report was then made available to the public via the GDC website.
 
Given that this was an interim order only, my concern is whether the the level of detail provided to the public at that stage of proceedings, was necessary or required. The family gave evidence at the inquest of Mr Lall that he was “an extremely private individual so the impact this had on his mental health was tremendous.” By putting detailed allegations into the public domain via the GDC website, at a stage before any final determination has taken place, I am concerned that others going through a similar process may also suffer a detrimental effect to their mental health. Consequently, in my view, there exists a risk that future deaths will occur.",On 18 May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barry Anthony LALL. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest which was held on 14th August 2023 . ,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you,the General Dental Council, have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Wednesday 11th October 2023.

He died at 06.30am on 31 March 2020 at Airedale General Hospital. He had a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. He had admissions at Bradford Royal Infirmary between 15 November and 04 December 2019 and 14 December and 14 January 2020. He suffered from confusion, cognitive and memory problems and lithium toxicity. He was discharged from Bradford Royal Infirmary to Norman Lodge Care Home. This resulted in a change of medical practice from Shipley to Low Moor Medical Centre. Concurrently his established Community Mental Health Care Coordinator changed – he did not have one on discharge from hospital. The new one was allocated on 24 January and was able to first meet with John on 05 March. John required a number of prescribed medications for his condition, including, crucially, lithium citrate. This was clearly referenced in the discharge letter and the Norman House care plan. Lithium was dispensed and administered between 15 and 24 January per his prescription. It was not supplied with the next 28 days medication. On 20-21 January a decision was made by GPs that blood tests were required before the prescription for lithium could resume. These confirmed by 04 February that John`s lithium was below therapeutic levels. For the purposes of the next prescription period, commencing from 17 February, however, lithium was not included. There had been GP oversight of this but there was a failure to recognise and act on the omission. John`s mental health declined critically from 03 march 2023. Advanced Nurse Practitioners attended Norman House 2-3 time per week. On 04 March, for the first time, an Advanced Nurse Practitioner examined John. She said she would prescribe lithium. It was dispensed and administered on 05 March. Therefore John did not receive lithium between 24 January and 05 March.  By the time it was resumed his condition was so severe that he required to be detained under Section 4 of the Mental Health Act 1983, in the early hours of 06 March 2020. He was admitted to the Bracken and then Fern wards of Airedale Centre for Mental Health. While admitted, albeit there were no other reported cases among staff or residents, he contracted Covid 19. This required his admission to Airedale General Hospital on 27 March 2020, where he subsequently died. He remained detained under section at the time of his death. James had been in a dependent position while at Norman House. Lithium could have resumed no later than 04 February and should have resumed no later than 17 February 2020, and it did not. There was a gross failure to provide basic medical attention insofar as: there was reference to lithium on the discharge summary; Johns’s case required specific attention; there was obvious evidence on system 1 available to be seen; John`s needs as a new patient should have been carefully considered; lithium prescribing, dispensing and administration should attract particular care and attention; there was an inherent importance in not delaying or interrupting lithium; there had been numerous requests and reminders from the care home about the provision of lithium; there was a material delay during which nothing was done by the GPs` surgery; there was failure to identify that delay; that failure led to the precise consequence that the lithium was intended to avoid. As a result of this gross failure, John required to be detained and admitted to Airedale Centre for Mental Health. The omission of the lithium contributed to his condition more than other factors. John contracted Covid 19 while admitted at Airedale Centre for Mental Health, most likely in the Fern Ward, possibly from a member of staff. While it is possible that he was at a greater risk of infection while in the Fern Ward than he would have been at Norman House, or any other environment at that time, it cannot be so concluded on a balance of probabilities. Therefore it cannot be concluded, on a balance of probabilities, that his death from Covid 19 was caused by his being detained under section, albeit the detention was preventable.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Firstly, it has to be recorded that the GP who gave evidence for Low Moor Medical Centre was a conspicuously honest witness and clearly exceptionally caring. He had been devastated by what had occurred in this case. But the fact remains, secondly, that there had been a gross failure to provide basic medical attention in relation to lithium prescribing and dispensing that resulted in John being sectioned.

The medical cause of death is [REDACTED] Asphyxia","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
(1)  The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner’s service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased’s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be’ likely end of July/August time’. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the ‘end of September/beginning of October’ and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased’s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author’s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due ‘end of September/beginning of October’. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.
 
(2)  The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.
 
(3)  If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah’s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.
 
(4)  I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths.
 
(5)  I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust’s response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report.",,In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6th of December 2023.

He was fit and ready for discharge and was awaiting a placement in a suitable care facility. Whilst in the acute hospital setting, he deteriorated rapidly. His nutritional requirements were not fully met and his swallow deteriorated, which led to further weight loss and ultimately to him developing aspiration pneumonia. Whilst an in-patient he contracted covid 19 which impacted his overall health further. He continued to deteriorate and died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 14th March 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The inquest heard evidence that if a suitable emergency social care placement had been available then Mr Hall would not have been admitted to hospital. However, there was no alternative as one could not be found and he was unsafe in the community. His stay in the acute setting led to a rapid deterioration. He had to continue to stay in hospital because a suitable social care placement could not be found for him. The evidence was that had he been in a suitable social care setting his needs would have been met in a more appropriate way.
 
The evidence was that these difficulties in finding a placement were as a result of issues in availability of social care within Stockport.",On 16th March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Hall. The investigation concluded on the 2nd August 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of poor swallow which developed whilst an inpatient where admission had been due to a shortage of a suitable community placement and discharge was delayed due to a shortage of a suitable social care placement. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7th December 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1.       Alex was not referred by school to NHS mental health services as a result of their experience that if Alex was in receipt of any other support he would not be accepted onto the waiting list (which would be in excess of 10 months to be seen).
2.       The school chose to provide Alex with school procured psychology support however the process of allocation of provision was not clear.
The school did not have a clear communication process with the provider of support to either refer the student into services or to receive outputs from those services once the student completed their sessions",On 21 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alex Dews born on 7 November 2008. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was:   ,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action. I would ask that your responses specifically consider the following:-
 
Department of Health and Social Care
Part of the challenge for the school was the decision about whether to obtain quick support for Alex through their counselling provision or whether to place Alex on a long waiting list for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services. They were not able to offer both as he would be removed from NHS services if he was receiving other service.
The provision of services for children and young people experiencing mental health difficulties carries long waiting lists and mitigation cannot be implemented where they will be removed from the waiting list for having that in place.
 
Department of Education
 
The provision of support services in school is not clear and consistent. The school in Alex’s case had to put in place their own provision as the Local procurement was delayed. In any event there is a lack of clarity around what should be in place in school in terms of counselling for those who may be transgender or questioning their identity or whether this is solely a role for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services.
 
Outwood Academy
 
The school did not have clear objective referral documentation in place for someone in Alex’s position which would assist with consistency of decision making. The school also did not have clear guidance from the psychology provider about what concerns may have been raised during counselling or what steps the school could take to support Alex following his sessions. There was reference to re referral but again there was no detail around this and the school did not enquire.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 December 2023.

·      Notwithstanding that I determined that it could not be established this fatal house fire was contributed to by Kiran’s eating disorder and how it was managed and responded to, I was satisfied that I have a duty to write this report.
 
·      At the time of her death, Kiran lived alone her flat with support from adult social care. A support worker assisted her with tasks such as ordering prescriptions, booking taxis, medical appointments, for example.
·      Although Kiran was said to have maintained a chronic low weight for some time, evidence before the inquest suggested that in the weeks prior to her death she lost significant weight, and could take steps to avoid accurate recording of her weight, such as on two occasions when she refused to remove her boots prior to being weighed. Her BMI was 14, and would reduce further. She was said to have been “presenting as not eating, and with an increased level of confusion” and no longer willing to have prescribed ensure drinks, something she had previously agreed to.
 
·      The quality of assistance she received from professionals varied. A support worker was proactive in seeking to provide Kiran with the help she needed, By contrast, during an inadequate mental health assessment the extent of her eating disorder and a declining weight was not considered to the degree clearly required.
 
·      This inquest was held some time after Kiran’s death, the inquest having been necessarily adjourned on previous occasions for a range of reasons.
 
·      The court heard how, at the time Kiran died, in terms of managing and treating an eating disorder the relevant guidance was what is often referred to as the MARSIPAN guidance. Some time later, from around May 2022, the Royal   College of Psychiatrists replaced that guidance with their up-dated Guidance on Recognising and Managing Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders, sometimes known as the MEED guidance.
 
·      The court received evidence from a witness who  at the time of Kiran’s death  had been Deputy Head of Adult Social Care and in her witness statement, she explained how it was part of her role to provide some level of oversight, and to identify any gap in services and address these. However, no significant internal investigation into Kiran’s death had taken place since, and no changes have  been made in response to her death.
 
·      She confirmed that at the time of Kiran’s death, Adult Social Care staff had not received training on how to recognise indicators of concern in relation to eating disorders.
 
·      A support worker explained how what knowledge he had about eating disorders he had accumulated from his experience of dealing with service users allocated  to him previously.
 
·      Two approved mental health practitioners [AHMPs] employed by Blackpool Council confirmed this also applied to AMHPs, with training on eating disorders limited to whether they happened to choose an eating disorder module as part of their annual refresher training.
 
·      There had been little if any awareness of the MARSIPAN guidance therefore around the time of Kiran’s death.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In   the circumstances it is my statutory duty to send the report:
 
The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows.
 
Eating disorders are increasingly prevalent. An eating disorder is a mental disorder and with a known high risk of mortality.
 
Many vulnerable people live in the community with support from adult social care, but who may not have access to specialist eating disorder services, perhaps due to a lack of availability or because they are reluctant to engage with specialist services.
 
As part of their illness, they may be reluctant to discuss their condition with family members, friends, or attend their GP surgery for monitoring of their weight.
 
It is important that adult social care staff, should they become aware of concerning signs of a previously unknown eating disorder problem, or identify a possible deterioration in the condition of a service user previously diagnosed with an eating disorder, take action within their range of powers to raise such concerns with the appropriate professionals, and possibly family members.
 
I have a concern that in the absence of the tools, training and access to the relevant guidance, well – meaning adult social care staff may not recognise when a situation arises and the service user will go without necessary and often very urgent, medical assessment and treatment, and with fatal consequences.
 
I do not seek to be prescriptive about what should now happen, and that is not the purpose of this report. I simply raise the concern.","The death of Kirandip Bharaj [known to her family as Kiran] on 14th September 2019 was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest on 30th September 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1.       Junior staff not knowing when to escalate concerns
2.       Unclear guidance in the handbook relating to chicken pox and reinfection and the need for aggressive antibiotic treatment if reinfection occurs soon after the initial infection
3.       Confirmation bias affecting clinical reviews
4.       Lack of proper assessment of existing skin lesions in chicken pox even where identified by parents
5.       Lack of knowledge of the risk of secondary complications from recent chicken pox infection in the emergency department
6.       Insufficient weight on GP referral when not through the identified route of referral (ie presentation straight to A&E which amounts to 25% of referrals). I heard evidence that an IT system is in development to resolve this however engagement of NHS Digital and the Commissioners is required to progress.

At the time of his death he was under investigation by the Police, allegations having been made against him by his ex-partner but prior to these allegations being made, Mr Condron had reported to the police that he was the victim of domestic abuse by that same partner. Mr Condron had been interviewed by the police on three separate occasions in relation to two different allegations. On the 23rd October 2017 the decision was made to take no further action in relation to the most serious of those allegations. Mr Condron had not been informed of that decision which exacerbated the extreme anxiety and stress he was experiencing at the time of his death.","During the course of the inquest, evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Mrs Fordham was placed on 1:1 nursing care in order to, amongst other things, mitigate the risk of further falls.
 
Those caring for Mrs Fordham failed to conduct a falls risk assessment, introduce a falls care plan, or conduct an enhanced care assessment when indicated, these successive failings resulted in removal of 1:1 care and then an unwitnessed fall on 25th November 2022. Mrs Fordham sustained a broken neck of femur and underwent a surgical repair. Post surgically, she was transferred to a step-down care centre where she died on 1st January 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1.     The poor quality of recording clinical records impeded the Trust’s governance processes, in that the author of a serious incident investigation was unable to rely on clear evidence to understand why essential actions were not carried out in Ms Fordham’s care.
 
2.     The Trust failed to complete a falls risk assessment of Ms Fordham.
 
3.      The consequence of (2) was that no falls care plan was completed.
 
4.     The fact that the failures at (2) & (3) were not detected and remediated by successive clinical staff members suggests that they did not read essential parts of the clinical record when providing care. The cumulative failings, on the part of multiple healthcare professionals suggests a culture of indifference inimical to the provision of safe and effective practice.
 
5.      The Trust has not considered any step to resolve individual failings in care through disciplinary or regulatory channels.",On 2nd January 2023 this Court commenced an investigation into the death of Iris Elaine Fordham aged 95 years.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust
1. The Trust’s Rapid Tranquilisation policy has not been sufficiently embedded through learning and development to ensure that all staff have a good working knowledge of the requirements for safely monitoring patients following the use of sedative medications
I heard evidence that ward staff had all received training on the policy as part of their initial induction, but all staff in this case had consistently failed to follow the policy, including senior ward leaders and medical staff, who informed the court that they were simply not aware of the necessary safeguards to monitor a patient’s consciousness level after administering tranquilisation medications, or how to do so when the patient was thought to be sleeping.","On 05 January 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Michelle Louise WHITEHEAD, aged 45.

Jessica and the coach driver died in the incident. ,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
This was a school commuter coach travelling on a motorway. It was constructed after 2001 and will have had seat belts fitted. Review of CCTV does not show the seatbelts were being used.
 
This coach had secondary school children on board. Some of the pupils those below 14 years of age would be expected to wear seatbelts under driver supervision.
 
The driver did not appear to be wearing a seat belt
 
A distinction should be drawn between school buses in built-up areas and school commuter coaches travelling a distance using A roads and the motorway network – with regard to the availability and use of seatbelts.
 
I take judicial notice that using seat belts can prevent some injury altogether, make inevitable injury less serve and reduce the risk of fatal injury.
 
1.     What advice does government wither through the Department of Transport, or the Department of Education give to schools and colleges when contracting for school bus commuter contracts – about the use of seatbelts?
What public information campaigns are being run about the additional road safety provided by the use of seatbelts?",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by November 30, 2023.

He had made multiple previous suicide attempts, including a very serious previous suicide attempt of hanging.  He had previously been arrested in December 2020 and assessed by Liaison & Diversion services whilst in Police custody. After he was remanded in custody, he was placed on an ACCT twice in prison. After his release from prison on 14th February 2021, he was referred to the community Mental Health Crisis service by his GP and also had another very recent suicide attempt in the form of an overdose of anti- depressants about a week before he was again arrested on 17th March 2021. In Police custody, he was seen by a Custodial Nurse Practitioner (CNP) who had very limited training in Mental Health and the recognition of the risk of suicide. The CNP was working alone and not alongside a doctor. The CNP assessed Jack’s risk as low. The CNP also did not refer him to Liaison & Diversion services, which the jury found that probably contributed to Jack’s death. A Forensic Medical Examiner in Police custody subsequently
assessed Jack’s risk as high. Jack was again remanded in custody. Despite Jack’s significant risk history as well as other significant risk factors, such as being young, withdrawing from alcohol and early days in custody, no ACCT was opened by prison or healthcare staff, who were overly reassured by Jack’s presentation.  An agency healthcare member of staff had no training in the ACCT process. The jury found that the failure to open an ACCT by prison and healthcare staff probably contributed to Jack’s death and that, on the balance of probability, the risk of suicide was not adequately identified for Jack. These findings by the jury were based on the over-emphasis by prison and healthcare staff on Jack’s presentation against clear and evidenced previous suicide and self-harm risks and attempts, which were available to relevant police, prison and healthcare staff. The Court heard evidence that 65% of primary care healthcare staff in prison are agency staff. The Home Office circular from 2003 relating to the use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners refers working alongside doctors and being specifically trained for their role. However, the Circular makes no mention of assessing the risk of suicide or self-harm in its Annex which lists competencies.","During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.       The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency.
 
2.       The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process. This places residents in prison at risk of death, given the high level of usage of agency healthcare staff in prison.","An investigation was commenced into the death of Jack Peter Zarrop, aged 23. The investigation concluded on 29 September 2023. The conclusion of the jury in the inquest was:
 
Suicide.
We, the jury, find the:
1. Failure to remove the bedsheet and close the hatch allowing Jack to create a ligature point
2. Failure to refer to Liaison and Diversion services in Central and North-West London and the failure to open an ACCT whilst in prison custody, either of which would have triggered a more thorough risk assessment
3. The difficulties accessing relevant and important information relevant to J. Zarrop’s history, both medical and custodial were the main contributing factors to the death of J. Zarrop.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27th November 2023.

He applied for indefinite leave to remain in 2004 but this was rejected in the same year.
2.        He had a history of severe mental health issues.
3.        Mr Santos was remanded to HMP Highdown on 29 October 2019, being transferred to HMP Belmarsh on 26 November 2019. On 6 May 2020, Mr Santos was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and was due to be released on 27 October 2020.
4.        On 5 October 2020, the Immigration Service served an IS91 notice of a decision to detain on Mr Santos. This meant he would not be released from prison at the end of his sentence whilst his deportation was considered. A Stage 1 letter had been served on 28 December 2018 but a Stage 2 letter had not been served. There was also an outstanding appeal in the First-tier immigration Tribunal.
5.        Mr Santos wrote a letter on a bail form outlining his concerns about returning to Brazil, referring to his sexuality and his health. This was sent by the prison to a charity assisting immigration detainees on 29 October 2020.
6.        In the early hours of 2 November 2020, the night officer found Mr Santos hanging in his cell during a routine check. Staff tried to resuscitate him. Ambulance staff arrived. Mr Santos was declared dead at 3.30am.
 
In summary, the jury found as follows:
 
·       That Mr Santos’ understanding of his immigration position at the conclusion of his custodial sentence made a material contribution to his death.
·       There was a failure to notify Mr Santos of the incoming IS91 form and its significance.
·       The central issue was communication between Mr Santos and the various agencies involved with him. By 16 October 2020 Mr Santos understood he would be detained at the end of his sentence but was confident his bail application would lead to resolution. However in the days prior to his death he told a fellow prisoner he believed he was to be placed in immigration detention and deported within days.
·       Confusion amongst the agencies involved in communicating with Mr Santos is likely to have played a vital role in his change of understanding but it was difficult to pinpoint the role that information passed to Mr Santos played in changing his understanding of his position. There were no adequate notes of a meeting on 22 October 2020 with Mr Santos and his prison and community offender managers. However it was clear that his view of his circumstances changed and he decided to end his life and deliberately did not clearly communicate his intent to those around him.","During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.
 
I have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1.      Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as “causative matters” in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases.
Timing of IS91 notification.
 
2.      The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage.
Signposting legal advice about immigration matters
 
3.      Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.
4.      I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.
5.      In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.
Communication between agencies
 
6.      Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.
7.      I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.
 
Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.
 
8.      I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos’ case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos’ case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.
9.      I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.
The SSHD Internal report
 
10.    The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos’ case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.
11.    The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos’ case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.
12.    This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been.","1.      The death of Manoel Messias Santos (“Mr Santos”) was reported to the coroner by HMP Belmarsh on the date of his death, 2 November 2020.                                                                                      .
2.      A forensic post-mortem was conducted on 5 November 2020. The medical cause of death of MS was 1a: Hanging
3.      On 24 February 2021 an Inquest was opened into the death of Mr Santos and an Article 2 Inquest was heard between 11 September 2023 and 25 September 2023 with a jury. The jury concluded with a narrative conclusion incorporating a conclusion of suicide.
4.      I considered Prevention of Future Death (“PFD”) evidence (written and oral) on 27 September 2023.","Action should be taken by The Secretary of State for the Home Department, HMP Belmarsh, His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service, the Ministry of Justice and Practice Plus Group:

2.      Consideration as to how to ensure there is effective signposting and facilitating of access to legal advice for FNOs. (HMP Belmarsh, HMPPS, MOJ)
3.      Consideration as to how to ensure more effective communication/information exchange between the SSHD and the prison and Healthcare. (HMP Belmarsh, HMPPS, MOJ, SSHD, Practice Plus)
4.      Consideration to be given as to why the Internal report dated February 2021 was not disseminated/placed on the Home Office file and to ensure this does not occur again. (SSHD)

She had a complex medical history with both physical and mental health problems. Post mortem results revealed she had died as the result of heart disease and that she had a combination of drugs in her system suggestive of excessive use, or overdose. Together these may have caused toxicity but none were at levels which individually would have caused fatality. It is not possible to ascertain her state of mind shortly prior to her death, but when seen by her GP on 01/03/2023 no particular concerns had been noted.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1.       The evidence given on behalf of the Birmingham & Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust was that in addition to this present case, where the deceased’s risk assessment was not updated between November 2021 and her death in March 2023 despite circumstances which I was told ought to have triggered an update, there were a further number of cases within the Trust in which Root Cause Analysis reports had been produced, where it had also been found that risk assessments were not being completed in line with expectations; further, that it was not clear why this was happening.
 
2.       If risk assessments are not being properly completed or updated, then there is an obvious risk of deaths occurring in the future, as a result of insufficient recording of risk. The fact that risk-relevant information may be recorded in the body of clinical notes is not reassuring, because a risk assessment or risk summary ought to capture the most salient risk information so that a professional looking quickly can absorb it; this is all the more important where professionals are under time pressure.
 
3.       The evidence given to me was that a ‘task and finish group’ has been set up to address the issue, which expects to have concluded by early next year, i.e. 2024, and that this group will be addressing matters as they are found rather than waiting until the final stage of its existence early next year. The evidence was that this group is at an early stage, with meetings considering the terms of reference and also, recently, the most appropriate persons to contribute to the group.
 
4.       In the circumstances I am concerned that currently there is an extant issue within the Trust about the completion of risk assessments being, on a number of occasions, unsatisfactory. The task and finish group is at an early stage and I do not know what it is going to do, or when. I therefore cannot be reassured that the issues around risk recording which that group is going to examine have, at this point in time, been addressed. It seems to me that they continue to exist, because there has been no evidence to tell me otherwise.
 
5.       In my opinion action needs to be taken to prevent the occurrence or continuance of the issue within the trust around the insufficient recording or updating of risk assessments, or to eliminate or reduce the risk of death created by such circumstances.","On 16 May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Paula LENIHAN.

Diagnostic tests suggested an obstructed biliary system, an ultrasound scan showed a dilated common bile duct (CBD).
 
Further imaging occurred on 2/4, a CT abdomen with findings suggestive of CBD stricture and possible malignancy. A MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography) provided a corroborative result on 4/4.
 
On 11/4 an ERCP (Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography) was undertaken and an unsuccessful attempt to insert a stent into the CBD was undertaken. A stent was inserted in the pancreatic duct.
 
A CT scan 13/4 on showed a duodenal perforation by displaced biliary stent with retroperitoneal gas/fluid.
 
A number of factors; the patient’s deterioration, an attempt at drainage through interventional radiology, and discussion regarding which hospital site should be utilised, led to delays in transferring the patient to another hospital for a laparotomy and washout which occurred on 16/4.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the
circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
–   Evidence was heard that at the time of the inquest radiologists do not have access to patient’ medical notes and base their reporting on a summary document submitted by the department requiring imaging. The summary document in Mr MORETON’s case was seen to be deficient in that it omitted his symptom of fever. It was heard in evidence a radiologist would need to telephone the department in question or go there to inspect the notes. Their awareness of a patient’s condition is based on a telephone call referral followed by a summary document which can be at odds with each.
–  It is of concern that the use of telephone referral system and summary could contain errors and the radiologist must rely on this information, with no quick way to inspect a patient’s notes.
–   The evidence also dealt with radiologists working in 2 hour triage shifts in a hectic environment where those clinicians receiving the referral seldom were the clinicians who carried out the imaging. The inference was the arrangement was susceptible to error.
–  Over the course of the inquest evidence was heard on a number of issues where information passed to and from clinicians involved in Mr MORETON’s care was inaccurate and misleading.
–  Assumptions were made that, Mr MORETON was improving clinically when a surgical opinion was sought, this was incorrect.
–   It was assumed Mr MORETON would be referred for a surgical opinion by ED department clinicians, when in fact none took place.
–  Clinicians in Newcastle Upon Tyne when asked for advice were under the impression treatment was working as it was mentioned his discharge from hospital was comptemplated
– this was not the case.
–   Overall I am concerned by the poor and misleading communications between clinicians, departments and Hospital Trusts on matters of vital importance to patient care.",On 5th April 2023 an inquest was opened into the death of Brian David MORETON.

In 2020 Mr Brooks’s health declined and he had multiple admissions to hospital. In August 2020 he was admitted to the Exmouth Community Hospital. Due to his diabetes insipidus Mr Brooks required monitoring of his blood sodium to ensure that he was maintaining the correct balance of fluid intake to remain stable. On admission his blood sodium was low, and he was on a restricted fluid intake; during his admission his condition improved, and he was moved from a restricted fluid intake to a daily target level of fluid intake of 2.5 to 3L per day. On 25 September 2020 Mr Brooks was discharged to the Barton Place Nursing Home. The discharge summary did not clearly set out Mr Brooks’s fluid requirements and the nursing home staff believed Mr Brooks was to be restricted to no more than 2.5 -3L per day rather than that figure being a target to aim for; the nursing home were advised it was a target on 9 October 2020 after Mr Brooks became unwell; the target level of 2.5 to 3L was not achieved during his stay in the nursing home. On 18 October 2020 Mr Brooks’ health deteriorated and was admitted to hospital where despite treatment he sadly died on 12 November 2020.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(1) During his evidence the consultant physician with the responsibility for the care and treatment of Mr Brooks acknowledged that the discharge summary was ambiguous and did not make it clear that the 2.5 – 3L was a target fluid intake; he agreed that it could be interpreted that Mr Brooks should be restricted to no more than 2.5 to 3L of fluid a day. As a consequence, the nursing home staff were unaware of the needs of Mr Brooks. The target fluid intake was not met in the period that Mr Brooks was in the nursing home, which contributed to his death.",On 10 November 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of Geoffrey Robin Brooks.

This was effective in controlling his mental health difficulties. Patients taking clozapine require close monitoring of their physical health due to the risks associated with the medication and attend a 4-weekly clinic. Blood samples are taken at these clinics to monitor white blood cell counts.   ,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1 The abnormal triglyceride levels in Mr Daniel’s blood, whilst reported by the lab, were not escalated by telephone as this was not required by the hospital procedure at the time.
 
I am pleased to note that Hampshire Hospitals Trust have updated their procedures to include telephone escalation of raised triglyceride levels.
 
However the RCA report indicated that the findings in this case should be shared with the Royal College of Pathologists with a request that raised triglyceride levels be added to the RCPath guidelines for telephone action. In information received after the inquest the Hampshire Hospitals Trust advised that they could not tell me whether or not this action has been undertaken.
 
2.  The RCA report identifed that the format of discharge summaries provided to GPs by the ED department needed to be reviewed to ensure that actions to be undertaken by GPs were clearly identified. The results of this were to be audited.
 
Following the inquest I was provided with an audit report. This report dated 13/9/21 revealed that the computer system could not be altered as had been hoped and therefore a change of practice was introduced instead. This required clinicians to document actions in a free text section with appropriate flagging for GPs.  20 cases were audited and only half met the standardised national guidance and 8 lacked a clear diagnosis & details of what was expected from GPs.
 
Hamsphire Hospital Trust have informed me that further actions are being taken to address these deficiencies. However as it is now a year since the RCA report was prepared and over 2 years since Mr Daniel’s death I am concerned that this action is not being taken swiftly given the risks to patients.
 
3.  In relation to the blood tests required under the clozapine guidelines I was informed that Southern Health take the monthly blood tests and run these in the clozapine clinic. However the blood tests required of the annual physical health checks are not taken by the Southern Health staff but rather patients are required to attend phlebotomy services elsewhere for the blood to be taken.
 
I heard evidence during the inquest that Mr Daniels had missed some of these blood test appointments which meant his full tests were not carried out when expected. Clozapine is prescribed only to patients suffering from an enduring mental health condition for whom other medication has not been effective which indicates that they may be at risk of having difficulty managing appointments.","On 08 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sebastian Harry DANIELS aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 01 September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:   On the 4th July 2021 Sebastian Harry Daniels died at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester. He died as a result of a hypertriglyceridemia caused by his diabetes, obesity and medication that he required to control his enduring mental health condition. This condition was identified during a blood test on the 30th April 2021 but the result was passed on in a manner which did not trigger a medical review.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by November 17, 2023.

He was found dead in his cell at HMP Pentonville on the morning of 21 November 2021.

However, the prison officer did not then seek medical attention for Mr Singh and the cell door remained locked shut for the rest of the night.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
There are many issues about which I would have made a prevention of future deaths report, had I not been told that systems have been radically overhauled since Mr Singh’s death.
 
I heard that the environment in which he was not assessed as he should have been upon entry and re-entry to prison, and in which he was never seen medically as a whole person, has completely changed.
 
The prison officer who did not seek medical attention for Mr Singh was investigated and found guilty of gross misconduct.
 
However, some points remain outstanding.
 
1.  The completion of the cell sharing risk assessment was described by the extremely experienced nurse who completed it, as careless.
 
2.  Though I was told that training for prison staff in how to deal with fits is to be given at HMP Pentonville in October 2023, I heard that there is only a hope that prisoners will also receive some guidance in what to do if their cellmate suffers a fit. Apparently, this has already been implemented in HMP Brixton.
 
3.  Whilst the fact that not all prison officers receive ongoing first aid training is a national resourcing issue, the level of first aid understanding of some prison officers at HMP Pentonville seemed surprisingly low.","On 30 November 2021, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Amarjit Singh, aged 41 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
HMP Aylesbury transitioned from a High Security Young Offenders Institution (a role it had undertaken for many years) into a Category C Training Prison after the time in which Haik Nikolyan had been an inmate. This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs.
 
Staffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time.
 
Healthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today.
 
Following the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward.
 
I was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward.
 
Some three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers.
 
Although initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work.
 
The evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution.
 
The indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majesty’s Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury.",On 15 March 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Haik Patrick NIKOLYAN aged 21. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 July 2023.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10th October 2023.

However, by that point Riya’s condition was irretrievable, and she died five days later.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Riya’s mother took her to hospital a full day before Riya’s fatal collapse, because she believed that Riya was very sick. Unfortunately, the junior doctor who examined and assessed Riya failed to appreciate the severity of her condition. Instead of giving her intravenous antibiotics and admitting her to hospital, he diagnosed a virus and discharged her with advice to take over the counter painkillers and a sheet describing the management of sore throats.
 
I intend to make a PFD report to the medical director of Northwick Park Hospital about the diagnosis and treatment of Riya’s condition. However, I am writing to you both because it seems to me that there is a fundamental issue regarding the lack of appropriate diagnosis and treatment that is apparent locally but relevant nationally.
 
When Riya’s mother took her to hospital, she did so because it seemed to her that this illness was qualitatively very different from any other that Riya had suffered in her nine years. In short, Riya’s mum was convinced that Riya was extremely ill, she articulated clearly and at every stage in hospital why she thought that Riya was extremely ill, and she even questioned the doctor about whether this could be a group A streptococcal infection. (There was a well publicised outbreak at the time and the hospital had actually received an alert about this.)
 
I heard at inquest that, even in the middle of the night, there was a consultant available to give a second opinion if this had been requested by medical personnel. However, no thought was given to seeking a second opinion. I think it highly likely that if it had been open to Riya’s family to seek a second opinion at that point, they would have done so without hesitation.
 
One of the reasons that coroners are local to an area is because this makes them better placed to recognise any local trends.","On 30 December 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Riya Hirani, aged 9 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday. I made a narrative determination, a copy of which I attach.   ","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13 November 2023.

Eclipse Morrison died from Perinatal Asphyxia. Her mother had been diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) after a blood test at 21 + 4 weeks. The mother’s blood glucose levels remained high throughout the pregnancy with the insulin dose being increased at each diabetic review.
Serial growth ultrasound scans identified that Eclipse’s growth was above the 95th customised centile and at the last scan at 37 + 3 weeks showed increased growth velocity. The mother went into spontaneous labour at 38 + 1 weeks and there was a shoulder dystocia during which there was a fracture of the humerus.
Eclipse weighed 5,800g at birth and showed no signs of life. Her Apgar scores were zero at 1, 5 and 10 minutes.

Ms Kerr was not seen by a surgeon or clinician prior to the 19 November 2019. Evidence revealed that Ms Kerr underwent a limited assessment prior to the procedures. The evidence is that Ms Kerr was provided with limited information regarding the risks and mortality  rate associated  with the procedures.  The fat  was collected and processed  before it was injected into her buttocks; a liposuction procedure and a Brazilian Buttock Lift procedure. During surgery Ms Kerr became unwell. Her condition deteriorated and she was declared dead. There is limited documentary evidence as to the procedures performed. Expert evidence was heard that certain techniques used during the Brazilian Buttock Lift procedure increased the risk of fat embolus occurring, namely the choice of access incision for the augmentation cannula and the decision to inject fat into the superficial muscle.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

I understand from the evidence heard that due to the high mortality associated with this procedure a voluntary moratorium on the practice of this procedure has been introduced in the UK. Recommendations for safer practices have emerged that recommend significant changes to practice.
2.    I am concerned that patients travelling to Turkey for this procedure are not being made aware of the risks and the high mortality rate associated with this surgery
3.    I am also concerned that patients are travelling abroad where there are no or limited controls with regard to such surgery taking place. Evidence was heard there Ms Kerr was  not seen by a surgeon before the date of the procedure. There was limited psychological and physical assessment prior to the procedure proceeding.
4.    I appreciate the UK Government has no control over what happens abroad.

Background
·       I heard evidence that when Ms GARLAND was on the Cardiac High Dependency Unit ‘HDU’ (part of the Intensive Care Unit) she was receiving intravenous antibiotics
·       When she then transferred from HDU to the Cardiac Ward there was a transcription error, and these antibiotics were accidentally omitted from the list of medications that she should be given on the new ward
·       As a result Ms GARLAND’s antibiotics were discontinued accidentally
·       I heard (and accepted) evidence that it would have been reasonable to discontinue antibiotics in any event at the time of Ms GARLAND’s transfer
·       Notwithstanding that fact, I remain deeply concerned by the circumstances in which the error took place
My concerns
 
·       I heard evidence from an ICU Consultant (who I found to be both a reliable and an impressive witness), who told me, among other things, that:
–        “… Transcription errors have always been a problem…” the ideal way to get rid of them would be to have a system [in the rest of the hospital] that speaks to ours
–        The ICU retains lists of its patients’ medication on a computerised/electronic system
–        The rest of the wards in the hospital do not operate the same system
–        The available systems do not speak to each other (to put it in somewhat colloquial terms)
–        Efforts to address that problem have proved fruitless
–        As a result, every time an inpatient moves from ICU to another department in the hospital, an appropriately qualified member of staff has to physically transcribe that patient’s medication list
–        With (for instance) 10 patients moving per day, 15-20 medications per patient, and multiple elements for each medication (name; dose; timing; indication; start date; signature etc.), “at a conservative estimate 1,500 to 2,000 elements [are transcribed] daily”
(Coroner’s comment: for obvious reasons this creates enormous potential for human error)
–        There are a limited number of people who can prescribe (and are therefore
able to perform this task); in critical care they are the same people who are responsible for providing care
–        “We really need a second check… funding for more pharmacists… as a Trust we’ve fallen short of ICU national standards for years in terms of the number of pharmacists per bed and medicines reconciliation”
–        “I spoke to the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer – he has submitted 5 proposals in the last 7 years to try to get the deficit funded… [without success]”
 
In summary, my view is that the circumstances currently in place create a very real (and known) risk that transcription errors will continue to occur. This in turn endangers patients, and creates a risk that people will die in the future as a result of such errors.
 
It is, sadly, very easy to envisage circumstances in which a patient might not receive essential medication at all, might receive the wrong dose of the medication they need, or might receive the wrong medication altogether, because of a transcription error.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.","On 31 October 2022 an investigation commenced into the death of Ms Cherry Lynne GARLAND, aged 77.

On 1st March 2023 he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham with suspected biliary sepsis/ascending cholangitis due to an obstructing bile gall stone as well as a bilateral basal consolidation which was revealed by a chest x ray.   Whilst in the ED, he was initially prescribed Tazocin for treatment of the sepsis but was then given a dose of Gentamicin which is in fact contraindicated in patients suffering from Myasthenia Gravis. He was not prescribed his normal Pyridostigmine.   On 2nd March he was transferred to a Liver ward for further treatment and arrangements were made for him to undergo an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Procedure (‘ERCP’) which could not be done until 3rd March.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1.       During the course of the inquest I heard evidence from the author of a Serious Investigation Report commissioned by the Trust (University Hospitals Birmingham) that the errors with regard to medication were, in part, due to a lack of awareness on the part of clinicians within the Trust as to the seriousness of Myasthenia Gravis as well as the interaction between Gentamicin and this condition.
2.       I also heard evidence from the author of the SI report about a comprehensive action plan that is being put in place to raise awareness within the Trust including the development and issue of a Trust wide patient safety notice in relation to Antibiotic Prescribing in patients with Myasthenia Gravis.
3.       However, given the apparent lack of awareness about Myasthenia Gravis amongst clinicians within UHB, a large hospital trust in a significant metropolitan area, I am concerned that there is a risk that a similar lack of awareness could persist amongst clinicians in other areas of the country and that consideration should be given to raising awareness more widely.",On 13 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Graham Thomas John SMITH.

The deceased was aged 42 at the time of her death on 16 May 2021. She had a past medical history of mixed schitzotypal and emotionally unstable personality disorder with traits of Asperger’s syndrome. She had mobility difficulties and required a bariatric bed due to concerns regarding skin integrity. She lived at home with her brother who cared for her. Lynsey Smalley was known to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) since 2005 and had a Care Coordinator who was a Community Psychiatric nurse. She was also open to a Psychiatrist and an Occupational therapist. On 6 April 2021 the CMHT were contacted by Lynsey’s brother who was concerned that Lynsey was acting strangely. A second call was made by her brother with concerns that Lynsey had relapsed and was displaying signs of paranoia, auditory and olfactory hallucinations, irritability, poor sleep and isolating herself in a particular room. A further call was made with reported concerns that Lynsey was lighting candles, had not used her prescribed oxygen and had not been eating, drinking, or sleeping for the past 4 days. It was indicated that there were only certain professionals Lynsey would agree to see but that she had agreed to see the care coordinator the following day. The GP prescribed medication and Lynsey’s brother was advised to contact Police if the situation became difficult. There was a total of 4 calls made by Lynsey’s brother to the out of hours crisis team. In addition, Lynsey’s brother contacted the emergency services for assistance. Police officers attended and a CID16 was completed and sent to the CMHT the following morning. By 9.10am on that same morning the CMHT reviewed the out of hours report. The care coordinator arrived at L’s home at 10.30am. Lynsey was reluctant to engage, and her brother reported concerns including that Lynsey had not slept for several nights, was not eating or drinking. He reported the incident overnight where Police had attended. The Care coordinator returned to the office and discussed with a psychiatrist, who agreed to visit that same day and the Advanced MH practitioner to assess and consider admission. After approximately 10 minutes of the care coordinator leaving Lynsey ignited a fire in the property. Emergency services were contacted. Lynsey was taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor where she remained until she passed away on 16th May 2021.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows
a.       The Health Board provided 3 investigation reports into the death, two of which contained conflicting evidence. One responded to Lynsey’s brother’s complaint. It is clear that there was no strategic plan or collaboration in governance processes. Furthermore, there were a number of proposed actions which took nearly two years to identify and complete. The time it took to identify and complete actions, together with governance processes are matters which I have raised previously with the Health Board in previous Prevention of future Death Reports. If there are such disjointed patient safety and governance processes learning will not be effective and deaths will continue to occur or will occur into the future.
 
A number of individuals and organisations are involved in the care of those under mental health teams or at times have contact with patients e.g. CMHT, Home Treatment Teams, Psychiatrists, Occupational therapists, Care Coordinators, out of hours crisis service (local authority based in Gwynedd), Police, Ambulance Service etc. As medical records remain paper based not all individuals or organisations who need to understand a patient’s circumstances/care/treatment are privy to all aspects of care/treatment. In addition, where a CMHT patient is receiving in-patient mental heath treatment the paper notes are transferred to the hospital setting. There is a risk that notes will become lost in full / in part. Having medical records electronically will not only allow full access to all notes to those who require which will inform future care/treatment but will also ensure effective continuity of care, without the risk of missing or lost notes. I have previously issued a Prevention of Future Deaths Report on this point, a copy of which was also sent to [REDACTED] , Health Minister.",On 18 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lynsey Sarah Smalley (DOB 6/3/79) who died on 16 May 2021.

On 7th December 2022 she consented to undergo a renal biopsy to harvest sample material in furtherance of the research programme. The procedure was completed after two attempts to take tissue.
 
A week later Mrs Choudhury was admitted into hospital with abdominal pain, haematuria, rapidly worsening acute kidney injury and a positive for gram negative rods in blood cultures.
 
Following diagnostic testing and imaging, Mrs Choudhury was admitted for treatment of a queried diagnosis of pyelonephritis and was administered enoxaparin for VTE risk.
 
Mrs Choudhury was not adequately monitored whilst an inpatient. She died following a cardiac arrest in hospital on 17th December 2022. The cardiac arrest was caused by hypovolaemia which, in turn was caused by a undiagnosed renal haemorrhage the result of the renal biopsy 7 days earlier. The haemorrhage was exacerbated by contraindicated VTE prophylaxis.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

2.     The clinical decision to administer VTE prophylaxis in the form of low molecular weight heparin on admission to a patient with a patent bleed, evidenced by haematuria.

Mr Jones arrived at Ysbyty Gwynedd at 21.33hrs on the 27th June 2021. He was admitted to the Emergency Department’s Red Zone at 22.34hrs and was observed by nursing staff throughout the night.
 
Mr Jones was first seen by a Doctor at 6.18am with the assessment recorded at 07.22am. X-rays were performed and at 7.43am, the suspicion of a small bowel obstruction was confirmed, with evidence of dilated small bowel loops on abdominal Xray. Mr Jones was then referred to the surgical senior house officer who reviewed the X-rays and agreed to further assessment. A decision to perform explorative surgery was made at 12.45pm and Mr Jones was taken to the anaesthetic room in preparation for surgery at 3.20pm.
Between his arrival at the hospital and being taken to the anaesthetic room in preparation for explorative surgery, Mr Jones experienced the following delays:
–          Approximately 10 hours to be seen by a Doctor in the Emergency Department – He was triaged at 22.15hrs on the 27th June 2021 and assigned to triage category 2. The evidence was that the aim is for a Dr to see triage category 2 patients within 10 minutes but the wait for Mr Jones from the point of triage to seeing a Dr was 8.5 hours.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN]
(1)    Continued pressures within the Accident and Emergency department at Ysbyty Gwynedd will result in:
(a)    Doctors not having the capacity to review patients in line with the “aim” e.g within 10 minutes for triage category 2 patients.
(b)    Missed opportunities that may prove fatal
 
(2)    Current staffing levels being insufficient to meet demand and safely care for patients

Talia was prescribed Fluoxetine by her general practitioner on 22 December 2021 for anxiety.

·      This inquest was about a man who, aged 90, died whilst waiting to be seen by  a medical professional in hospital. He did not simply arrive at hospital,  but   had been assessed and then sent there by his GP, who felt, rightly as it turned out, that Derek may have developed an obstruction. He was anticipating   Derek would be seen quickly.
 
·      He arrived at the Emergency Department, and handed in some paperwork at reception and understandably expected he would not have to wait long to be assessed by doctors who he knew were expecting him.
 
·      No-one called for him for almost two hours by which time he had died.
 
·      It is correct to say that once a post mortem examination was performed, it was clear that even if he had been assessed immediately upon arrival at hospital his condition was such that surgical intervention was not a realistic possibility and the condition was going to prove terminal.
 
·      At the time Derek arrived, as the Hospital Trust’s own internal review of this death explained, such were the pressures on the hospital Trust posed by patient numbers that it was operating at OPEL [Operations Pressure Escalation Level] 4. This is a method used by the NHS to measure the stress, demands, and pressure a hospital is under. OPEL 4 represents the highest level, when a hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient
safety is at risk”.","During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
·      Concern 1 – that the medical professionals who work in a hospital emergency department are routinely expected to do so when the OPEL 4 applies, a recognition they are performing their roles when the hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient safety is at risk”. Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.
 
·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for. There is a clear risk that puts patients at risk and it would be remiss of me not to raise it.
 
·      Concern 3 – Finally, it is relevant to point out that Derek had not moved for    some time before a medical professional called for Derek.  I  formed the  view that there had been a reluctance on his Friend’s part to request assistance due   to the pressures staff were clearly under, but also because he had already  handed in Derek’s paperwork and was expecting some assistance imminently which did not arrive. I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures.","The death of Harold Derek PEDLEY Otherwise known as Derek PEDLEY on 21.12.22 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th August 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

Ms Levy had severely oedematous lower limbs, the skin on her legs and feet had extensive cellulitis which had caused chronic ulceration, discoloration and a tree-bark texture. Her toenails were long, infected and discoloured.
 
The deceased had extensive uterine fibroids that had progressed to the stage that they impeded her mobility and continence.
 
Ms Levy had clinical signs of sepsis and a stage two acute kidney injury.
 
The patient was admitted to hospital by ambulance and underwent surgical debridement of dead ulcerated skin and tissue, following surgery she succumbed to infection despite maximal medical support and died on 14th December 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1.       Since 2020 Ms Levy had been provided with domiciliary care commissioned by the local authority. At the time of her death twice daily visits were undertaken. Ms Levy was utilising state funded domiciliary care visits to deliver fast food to her home, no personal care was being provided. Carers had escalated to the local authority Ms Levy’s reluctance to accept personal care and raised safeguarding reports regarding Ms Levy’s living conditions.
 
2.       In the two months prior to her final admission into hospital Ms Levy was being regularly assessed by district nurses, the community matron and her GP. Despite the obvious nature of her deteriorating health, no meaningful steps were taken to escalate the care she received to mitigate the risks of her self-neglect.
 
3.       The inquest heard that as Ms Levy was believed to have capacity throughout this period, and consequently it was determined that there were on practical steps that could have been taken to improve the provision of care to her.
 
4.       No formal Mental Capacity Act assessment was ever undertaken or considered.","On 15th December 2022, this Court commenced an investigation into the death of Donna Levy aged 51 years .

He was arrested and interviewed under caution at the end of May 2022, following which he was bailed. That bail was converted to RUI (released under investigation) in August 2022. He attended voluntarily a further interview on 5 November 2022.
 
On 23 January 2023, the CPS authorised that he be charged. This led to the generation of a PCR (Postal Charge Requisition) which was posted to him on 16 February 2023. This did not arrive at Mr Leger’s address until after his death. However, Mr Leger learnt of the charge via his solicitor on the morning of 20 February 2023. Sometime between 7:30pm and 10:30pm on 20 February 2023, he took his own life.
 
He had previously attempted to take his own life on 23 March 2022, after he had learnt of the allegation made against him. The investigating officer (OIC) was aware of this as Mr Leger had disclosed it when asked questions regarding his mental health and welfare at the times of the two interviews he attended. Although he had indicated at the times of the interviews that he had no concerns regarding his mental health/welfare, he also stated on 5 November 2022 that his mental health had suffered since the alleged incident.
 
This was the last date that any assessment was made of his mental health. By the time that he was sent the PCR (charging him with an offence that carried a maximum life sentence), he had been “RUI’d” for almost 6 months and it was more than 3 months since there had last been any formal assessment by the police of his mental health and risk of suicide or self-harm.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I received evidence, in particular from the investigating officer (OIC), who dealt with the investigation into the allegation against Mr Leger, and from an investigator from the Metropolitan Police’s Directorate of Professional Standards (DPS), who conducted an investigation on behalf of the IOPC into the way in which the criminal investigation was undertaken, in particular the consideration of Mr Leger’s welfare and support offered to

Her case was inappropriately screened as routine and the referral was triaged 8 weeks later. Allison was not communicated with at this time, but her mother shared a full account of concerns with the triage psychologist. Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face. They determined the case to be low risk and placed it in the green zone. The concerns shared with the service should have resulted in a more urgent face to face assessment. The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison’s mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison’s worrying presentation.
There was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan. A decision was made to discharge Allison from the mental health team, with no multi-disciplinary review or liaison with the referrer. Allison continued to receive counselling provided at her school, but this concluded at the end of term, on the 15 July 2022. On the 18 July 2022 Allison was found suspended in her bedroom. The failure to provide basic mental health care to Allison contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
 
The Inquest identified multiple failings in the care provided to Allison. The failings occurred within a children and adolescent mental health service which was significantly under resourced.
 
The Inquest heard evidence that the under resourcing of CAMHS services is not confined to this local Trust but is a matter of National concern.
 
The under resourcing of CAMHS services contributed to delays in Allison being assessed by the mental health team. The delay between triage to assessment was 9 months. The Inquest heard evidence that this delay is not unusual within CAMHS teams across the country.
 
There was very little evidence of any consultant psychiatrist leadership within the CAMHS team. The Inquest heard of the difficulties in recruiting suitably qualified psychiatrists to CAMHS teams.
 
The Inquest heard that funding for CAMHS teams within the allocation of funding for general mental health is poor.
 
The Inquest heard that the number of children presenting to CAMHS teams is increasing significantly. The number of referrals of children to the local CAMHS team in the early 2010s was between 10 – 12 per week.  The current number of referrals is in the region of 140 patients per week.
 
There is a concern that ongoing under resourcing of CAMHS services (whilst demand continues to increase), will result in future similar deaths.","On 3 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Allison Vivian Jacome Aules. Allison was 12 years old when she passed away on the 19th July 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 17th August 2023.

On 6 November 2022, Audrey was admitted to RCHT with abdominal pain secondary to femoral hernia obstruction. The apixaban was suspended pending surgery. Audrey underwent surgery for femoral hernia repair, that same day, 6 November 2022. The operation was uneventful.
 
On 9 November 2022 the eldercare consultant reviewed Audrey. The review notes were handwritten on paper medical notes. The eldercare consultant recommended that the surgical team restart Apixaban as soon as safe post operatively.
 
The court heard evidence that the NICE guidance on this subject states
 
Stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation; Post procedure with immediate and complete haemostasis NOACs can generally be resumed 6–8 h after the end of the intervention. Some surgical interventions carry increased bleeding risk in which case resume anticoagulation 48–72 h post procedure but at the earliest opportunity
 
The apixaban was not restarted.
 
On 11 November 2022 Audrey had a severe stroke secondary to AF. Audrey died as a result of this complication four days later.
 
The court found that whether and when to re-start the apixaban was a decision for the surgical team. The court heard that on the consultant surgeon’s ward round his junior doctor colleague was briefing him, this included reference to the eldercare review paper notes. The junior doctor went through a number of aspects regarding care and treatment but did not refer to the recommendation to re-start apixaban. As a result, the consultant surgeon did not consider whether or not to re-start the apixaban.
 
The court heard that the eldercare team use paper medical notes whilst the surgical team use a digital system, known as NerveCentre. The consultant surgeon stated that the digital system is easier for the surgical team to read because the consultant surgeons can look at the detail on their phone or iPad. The consultant surgeon considered that the different recording platforms contributed to the error of omission in Audrey’s case.
 
Where an ‘important clinical note’ has been handwritten in the handwritten record there is facility for highlighting this on the ‘ward round’ function on Nerve centre. There was no alert that clinical notes had been handwritten in the written notes following the review by the eldercare consultant on 9th November.
 
The court found that apixaban was prescribed on admission and correctly suspended due to bleeding risk in light of pending surgery. There is no evidence of review of this suspension in either medicines reconciliation (10th November) or in the medical records. The court heard that there is no automatic flag on the Electronic Prescribing Medication Administration (EPMA) requiring review of the ongoing suspension of prescribed medication.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The cause of death was hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, caused by a cardiac arrest, which itself was caused by a cardiac.   ","During the course of the inquest it transpired that there had previously been a scheme undertaken by Wetherspoons allowing staff to undertake additional training including CPR training. The evidence that was heard from a Consultant Intensivist was that the sooner that CPR can be commenced the greater chance that a person is able to survive a cardiac arrest, with minimal if no long lasting disabilities. The inquest concluded that the EMD should have directed staff at the Lord Cradoc to commence CPR and it is understood that compulsory training has been given to all Wetherspoons staff to enable them to comply with EMD instructions. This compulsory training dod not extend to CPR training.
 
It is not the purpose of this report to compel your organisation to provide CPR training to its staff but to make such training available to staff who express an interest. It is recognised that such situations are stressful situations and that it would be unfair to impose compulsory CPR training to staff, however as with all organisations some individuals would welcome the opportunity to benefit from such training. No failings were found against the staff who attended to Christopher that evening and they ought to be commended for their actions.
 
I am concerned that in such cases bar staff at pubs will invariably find themselves in situations where the administering of emergency CPR treatment ought to be administered. The time taken between the beginning of an emergency call and an instruction to commence CPR may deprive a patient of a favourable outcome. Whilst Wetherspoons staff have been trained to comply with EMD instructions there are occasions such as this case where staff could implement CPR of their own accord before being instructed to do so by EMD’s. The training would not only teach staff the correct techniques but educate them of the situations in which CPR should be used.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
1.       In a pub environment there is a greater chance for the public to sustain injuries that requires emergency treatment
2.       Ordinary bystanders’ ability to administer emergency treatment may be hindered by their own consumption of alcohol
3.       Whilst the primary responsibility of staff is to comply with EMD directions they are deprived of the opportunity to provide lifesaving treatment in circumstances that warrant it if that training is not offered
4.       Staff would not know the circumstances that warrant it without the benefit of CPR training.",On the 11th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher James Locke.

He had owned his plane, a Cap- 10-B since 2014. He had a current and valid private pilot’s licence which permitted him to fly under Visual Flight Rules (“VFR”). Mr Mann did not possess the skills, experience of ability to fly in cloud; he could only fly in clear skies as he was unable to “instrument fly” and could only fly by reference to what he could see out of the window.
 
His passenger on the day, Mrs Costa, had no flying experience and did not possess a pilot’s licence. She had no active part in the events that unfolded.
 
On 12th August 2021 at 08:04 Mr Mann took off from Watchford Farm, Yarcombe near Taunton, Somerset with Mrs Costa on a planned pleasure trip for the day to the Isle of Sicily. There was no evidence that Mr Mann had used recognised aviation sources to check the weather prior to departure, instead obtaining weather information from news weather-based apps.
 
At around 09:10 the weather conditions deteriorated and so Mr Mann turned back. At around 10:10 found himself at an altitude of 7,500ft flying above cloud, He was not qualified to fly through cloud. He contacted the Distress and Diversion Cell (“D&D Cell”) on the emergency frequency for assistance.
 
Mr Mann began to descend to a lower altitude but he appears to have become spatially disorientated due to the extreme stress of flying in the weather conditions in which he found himself and when he emerged from cloud, the ground was not where he expected it to be. The plane collided with a large oak tree at Lower Colley Farm, Buckland St Mary near Chard, Somerset and was destroyed on impact with both the pilot and passenger being thrown from the wreckage and suffering catastrophic injuries that were incompatible with life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The D&D cell did not request or receive any critical information about
(i)   the pilot’s capabilities (i.e that he could not instrument fly and/or fly in cloud);
(ii)   the plane’s capabilities (i.e. that it was not equipped to allow the pilot to instrument fly)
(iii)   the weather conditions at the selected diversion aerodrome (to ensure that the weather was more favourable to the conditions at the home aerodrome).

The fire was found to have been caused by a faulty lithium ion e-bike battery which was charging at the time.
 
The e-bike from which the battery came, which was owned by another occupant of the flat, had been heavily modified, notably including a retro- fitted additional battery cage and motor.
 
I found on the evidence, which included that of a London Fire Brigade Fire Investigation Officer (whose evidence was in turn informed by input from the Chief Scientific Adviser at the Fire Science Department, who had examined the e-bike and remains of the charger\battery), that the fire started with a faulty lithium ion battery, probably a battery and charger which did not match and carried different voltage ratings, leading to thermal runaway and catastrophic failure of the lithium ion battery.
 
Despite attempts by occupants of the flat to prevent the fire’s escalation, this was not possible and the flat quickly filled with toxic smoke necessitating its evacuation. Sadly, Mr Rahman did not successfully evacuate before he was overcome by the smoke, causing his death.","During the course of the investigation, including the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

I have received evidence, in particular from the London Fire Brigade’s Fire Investigation Team:
 
·       That Mr Rahman’s death is the ninth nationally in approximately one year, in six fires attributed to faulty lithium ion batteries.

I was told by [REDACTED], from whom I heard evidence, that the most risky transition was from standing to sitting and that during this transfer the Deceased, due to her visual impairment, would often miss the seat and fall. It was “part of her” which I took to mean an inherent and constant risk.  [REDACTED], the care home manager, candidly accepted that “we all knew you had to watch Doris when she sits down”.
 
On 6th Mrs Urch was in the lounge of Globe House when she became distressed, lost her balance and fell.
 
It is clear that Ms Urch was not being supervised or assisted by the only carer present,  [REDACTED] , who was “sitting…with the other residents”.  [REDACTED] acknowledged that this was a mistake.
 
She was taken to Hospital where a CT scan evinced a large acute left frontal intracranial haemorrhage with extensive longstanding cerebral atrophy. It was decided that surgical intervention was not in her best interests and the focus shifted to palliative care.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1)  The Question and Answer tickbox form for Risk Assessment seemed to me to leave much to be desired. It was excessively binary and meant that those who filled it in did not need to “engage” with the particular patient.
 
(2)  The Risk Assessment did not make no recommendations or suggestions as to what to do about the risks identified.
 
(3)  Staff seemed unfamiliar with the risk assessment/care plan, which I consider more of a systemic problem. It is unclear if/when care plans were reviewed by staff.
 
(4)  The care plan/risk assessment was not updated in light of a fall in November/December 2022. I was concerned that potentially significant developments might not be being taken into account in keeping the care plan under review.
 
(5)  The system does not preserve old care plans in their contemporaneous format which is a serious shortcoming which has the potential to hinder future investigations. I encourage that system to be reviewed.","On 3 March 2023 the Senior Coroner, Mary Hassell, commenced an investigation into the death of Doris Urch aged 90 years.

Following a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, in 2000, her mobility slowly declined, eventually losing the ability to stand and walk and becoming reliant on a mobility scooter.","From the evidence I received, at the inquest, there are matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
During the inquest I heard evidence of the following matters:
·       Shirley was an unusual local authority OT service user because she operated her hoist and sling mainly without the assistance of a carer because she wanted to maintain her independence and dignity as much as possible. Because she had mental capacity the OT service respected her wishes.
·       Shirley’s husband who was the main carer at the time of her death did not receive any training from the local authority in safe usage of the hoist and in particular use of the red emergency pull cord. It was not clear whether Shirley had received any training on the use of the red pull cord when she was provided with the hoist because there was no paperwork confirming training had been delivered.
·       I found that when Shirley was suspended in the hoist, she did not use the red pull cord, on the underside of the hoist unit, because it had not lowered and because her husband was able to use the hand control to manoeuvre her toward the scooter. He would not be able to do this if the red cord had been pulled because the electric power would switch off.
·       Higher Elevation reported inspections of the hoist to the AMT but not to the OT department. The AMT, in turn, did not share those reports with the OT department.
·       The Inspection by Bureau Veritas 30/6/23 only reported to AMT but not the OT dept. The AMT did not share the report with the OT department. I was informed that although the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1988 (LOLER) did not apply, nonetheless six-monthly inspections were performed on a voluntary basis.
·       The last Bureau Veritas inspection was done without access to reports from Higher Elevation and email reports from Shirley to the OT department. Veritas reported there were no problems on its last inspection of 30/6/23 over 2 weeks before the death. That report was made without sight of the Shirley’s report to the OT department, on 9/4/21, and the Higher Elevation report to the AMT on the same day.
·       I was also told by Shirley’s husband that the same model of hoist in the bathroom had also failed to lower on occasions.
·       At present the bedroom hoist, and hoists in the bathroom and living room remain in situ at Shirley’s home and are available for inspection. Shirley was a local authority tenant when she died and due to pressure on its housing stock the local authority is anxious to re-let the property to new tenants. Therefore, it is desirable that the hoists are inspected in situ as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will have to be inspected whilst in local authority storage.
·       I was reassured that the London Borough of Southwark is seeking to introduce guidance to its OT service to ensure the risk of recurrence in future is reduced in relation to service users operating hoist equipment unassisted in their homes. However, given my concern that recurrence should be avoided elsewhere in England and Wales I am reporting this to the MHRA to investigate and if necessary, alert and give guidance to other local authorities regarding the evidence which emerged during my investigation.

The neighbours [REDACTED] called the police and gave shelter to Kelvin’s partner and her daughter. At this point, the first officer on scene attempted to gain entry after announcing she was police but was unsuccessful, so called for back-up assistance with method of entry equipment.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Out of hours and emergency mental health care for people who are not registered with an NHS GP in Milton Keynes may be obtained by attending the Emergency Department at the Milton Keynes University Hospital where mental health professionals are based.
 
Through Kelvin’s period of deteriorating mental health, which was obvious to those who knew him, his mother made repeated attempts to secure mental health assessment and care for him.
 
She was not directed clearly by the professionals she did have contact with, to take him to the Emergency Department for assistance. There was a gap which Kelvin fell through and he did not receive either mental health assessment or care. It was not possible to say that the failure to receive assessment or care resulted in Kelvin attempting to take the lives of others and succeeding in taking the life of his male neighbour.
 
It was clear that the lack of clear information and direction in regard to how to obtain that mental health assessment or care contributed to Kelvin not presenting for assessment which may possibly have averted the tragic events which unfolded on the 26th June 2021. This in turn raises the prospect that others, in similar predicaments may also be unable to obtain the care required.",On 01 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Odichukwumma Kelvin IGWEANI aged 24.

The driver explained that he had earlier observed something in that area when travelling between Millom into Barrow, around 0625hrs, but had been unsure what this was.

Detailed factual findings in Security Sensitive form are held by MOD and I request that you should have regard to the full Security Sensitive factual findings.,"I have been greatly assisted by detailed evidence from MOD on the changes made to the relevant aspects of military diving training since Ben’s death. From that evidence it is very clear that there has been a comprehensive and far-reaching review of policies, practices and organisational structures which will have very significantly reduced the risk of future fatalities. In several areas, the changes made go beyond those recommended by the Defence Safety Authority, and in nearly all other cases the recommendations have been adequately addressed. There are a few areas where there remains technological limitations to the response to the earlier DSA recommendations , but I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard that appropriate technological advances are being rapidly sought, with the risks in the meantime being mitigated by other means. Among over thirty recommendations arising from earlier investigations where extensive action has already been taken, there are four discrete areas in relation to which I assess that the Statutory threshold for me to make a Report to Prevent Future Deaths is met. Accordingly, it is still the case that during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to conce rn. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you .
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(1)  A stand-by diver was present at the dive exercise and he was deployed to try to find and rescue Ben. However, the stand-by diver had to surface having run out of breathable gas before Ben was found. A spare breathing apparatus cylinder was not carried in the safety boat for the stand-by diver (or other divers) to use in the event that the stand-by diver’s main cylinder ran out.
 
(2)  The progression of the dive training in which Ben was engaged was safety-critical. The progression of training was accelerated for several reasons, one of which was a visit by a high-ranking naval officer. The concern of the instructing staff was to polish the drills ahead of that visit and to take the pressure off the dive students by allowing them to practise
the dive with relevant equipment ahead of the visit. This acceleration of safety-critical training in part because of such a visit was not appropriate.
 
(3)  Ben was lifted unconscious from the sea bed and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation was immediately started. A defibrillator was also applied, but this was only available because it was carried by a Harbour Patrol vessel which came to assist. I am concerned that in such safety-critical military diving training, the dive support staff did not have available to them a defibrillator of their own either on the supporting safety boats or on land. This did not cause or contribute to Ben’s death but could lead to future fatalities.
 
(4) There is an inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus as between the maintenance manual for which DE&S is responsible and all other policy and safety guidance.","On 26 November 2018 the Senior Coroner for Dorset commenced an investigation into the death of BENJAMIN DAVID MCQUEEN, aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held by me as nominated Judge Coroner from 10 to 28 July 2023. ","(1)   As to carrying a spare breathing apparatus cylinder in safety boats in addition to that carried by the stand-by diver where this is practicable, I am reassured that this appears to be happening in practice in Ben’s former unit. But I have a concern that this does not yet appear in policy guidance and it is a safety concern that may need to be more widely shared in defence.
 
(2)   As to avoiding visits by senior ranking Officers or VIP visitors to training courses leading to an acceleration of safety-critical training, I am reassured that action has been taken in Ben’s former unit such that this should not recur in relation to the relevant diving training. But I have a concern as to whether this has been shared more widely amongst other military units.
 
(3)   As to the availability of defibrillators, I was informed that they are present at some, but not all, dive sites used by Ben’s former Unit. The risk assessment suggesting that defibrillators are not required because of the age/health profile of those attending the diving training appears to focus upon the risk of myocardial infarction (or similar) from a natural cause or routine exercise, rather than the risk of cardiac arrest / heart arrythmias caused by traumatic injury when carrying out arduous military diving.
 
(4)   As to the inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus, I was informed that the relevant operators would not need to consult the detailed maintenance manual such that confusion should not occur. Nevertheless, I consider that in the sphere of safety-critical dive training, there is an unnecessary residual risk in different figures being given for the minimum safety pressure level for a type of diver’s breathing apparatus.
 
In relation to each of these areas, in my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you as the responsible Minister for the Ministry of Defence have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Friday 22 September 2023.

He had also undergone amputations of his toes due to non-healing diabetic ulcers.  
 
His daughter, said in evidence that he was admitted to hospital on 30th   May 2022 following a fall at home. He said that he’d fallen forward and onto his knee. He was lifted from the floor and onto his bed by his family where he remained until an ambulance was called, when the decision was taken to admit him to the Royal United Hosptial (the RUH) in Bath.  
 
He was admitted via the Emergency department, then to the medical assessment unit (MAU), and then onto the Orthopaedic ward – Pierce Ward on 1st  June 2022 in the early hours.  
 
According to the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mr Nippard was initially admitted, with the diagnosis of right knee septic arthritis and an acute kidney injury on top of his chronic kidney disease. Mr Nippard was on antibiotics and on 2nd   June 2022 underwent a washout of his knee. On 8th   June he had a second washout. By 17th   June he was deteriorating, on 20th   June his CRP was increasing. He said in his evidence that the pressure sore was first documented by the orthopaedic team on 21stJune, the surgeon described this now as – the bigger source of infection.  
 
An MRI was requested but did not take place for 4 days; it was undertaken on 25th June and reported as showing no obvious sacral osteomyelitis it did show that it had locally spread in the soft tissue.  
 
By 28th June Mr Nippard was getting worse, his inflammatory markers were going up and now his testicles were swollen, and there was a suspicion was that this was Fournier’s Gangrene and there was a referral made to the Urology team. 
   
The orthopaedic surgeon said that as far as the treatment for Mr Nippard’s knee went, he felt they were winning that it was improving that if he hadn’t developed the pressure sore his expectation was that he would have been discharged. He agreed with the medical cause of death proposed.  
 
A Consultant Urologist examined Mr Nippard on 28th June, he said that he had evidence of a significant infection, that the only treatment was surgery, and all agreed that surgery was not likely to help, and it would cause Mr Nippard immense suffering in his last days. He explained that the other medical conditions Mr Nippard suffered with caused him to be compromised, if he’d had a stronger heart and kidneys then they would have operated 
 
Sadly, after discussions with Urologists, Surgeons, Anesthetists and the Critical care team it was decided that Mr Nippard was not fit for surgery, and he was placed on priorities of care and died on 6th   July 2022. 
 
It was the view of the doctors who attended the inquest and gave evidence that the pressure sore significantly contributed to Mr Nippard’s death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

28/07/2023,27/07/2023,2023-0275,Johanne Blackwood,Sean Horstead,Essex,Railway related deaths | Suicide (from 2015),Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/johanne-blackwood-prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Johanne-Blackwood-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0275_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-0275-Response-from-Essex-Partnership-University-NHS-Fondation-Trust-.pdf,"A central aspect of Jo’s delusional beliefs was that (a) she had not slept for years and (b) that she suffered from a fatal physical health condition. The desperation engendered by her delusional and medically entirely unfounded beliefs led to a number of suicide attempts and both voluntary and compulsory admissions to mental health units.   On the pt May 2021 Jo had attempted suicide [REDACTED] , some five weeks later, she would end her life. In the light of this incident her community risk assessment, her care plan and her safety plan were not up-dated – as they had not been since the date of her last discharge as a mental health in-patient on the 18th December 2020.
 
Whilst her high risk of suicide was acknowledged by the community mental health team responsible for her safety – and care, management and treatment – in the community, and notwithstanding the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, I found an inappropriate over-reliance upon her family members, principally her husband and son, to keep Jo safe in the community. This involved the family monitoring Jo 24 hours a day, seven days a week over an extended period and physically preventing her from leaving her home address unaccompanied .
 
This over-reliance was misguided and placed an unfair and unsustainable burden on the family, particularly in the light of a highly concerning text message sent by Jo to her Care Coordinator threatening suicide on the 11th June, the day before she took her own life. Following receipt of the text and seemingly reassured in part by Jo’s apparent retraction of the threat later that day, there was a failure to undertake an urgent face to face assessment by the community team to establish whether a referral to the Crisis Team was necessary; this specific failure possibly contributed to the subsequent death.
 
In the circumstances I concluded that an inappropriate over-reliance upon family members to keep such a vulnerable and high-risk person safe in the community, over an extended period of time, probably contributed to Jo taking her own life on the 12th June 2021.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. Although not identified as causative of the death in this case, in my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
1.     Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to when, where and by (or between) whom any formal handover of responsibility as Care Coordinator (CC) for Jo took place as between a number of CCs allocated to Jo over a period of many months from the lead up to and following her discharge as an in-patient back to the community team on December 18th 2020 and through to early May 2021.
 
2.     Consequently , the evidence confirmed, despite her clear vulnerabilities, Jo did not have an allocated Care Coordinator for several weeks up to the beginning of May 2021. The evidence also confirmed that the lack of clarity as to the timing and conduct of CC handovers and the absence of an allocated CC to work with Jo (and by extension, her family) was informed by lack of a formal policy or procedure requiring that a full, detailed, formal record of handover between Care Coordinators is to be placed on EPUT electronic records.
 
3.    Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff, has the responsibilitv for oversight of patient carefollowing discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event of relapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced.
 
Please note that this 3rd concern was previously raised by me with
–               CEO of EPUT (and in very similar terms) in a PFDR dated 25.02.2022 following the death of Stephanie Moyce.
 
4. The community Risk Assessment, Care Plan and Security Plan for Jo were not updated by a Care Coordinator between December 2020 and Jo’s death.","On 15th June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Johanne Blackwood, aged 55 years.

During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Despite there being concerns for an unresponsive patient’s breathing, it took:
 
a) At least 6 minutes to obtain and utilise physical monitoring equipment.
b) Nearly ten minutes for a ward doctor to attend the patient.

Despite the best efforts of her family and emergency services she was declared deceased that evening.
 
Her death was caused by a pulmonary embolism, in turn caused by a deep vein thrombosis.
 
Earlier that day Ms Nakafeero had been discharged from hospital having presented with symptoms of menorrhagia and associated pain and anaemia on 19th June 2022.
 
Whilst an inpatient, Ms Nakafeero was assessed for risk of venous-thrombo-embolism (“VTE”) risk utilising the Trust’s VTE policy, she was categorised as having zero risk of thrombo-embolism.
 
Ms Nakafeero had been diagnosed with uterine fibroids since 2019 and had been prescribed tranexamic acid and pain relief to control the symptoms.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1.       Ms Nakafeero was assessed at a Gynae-oncology clinic in early 2019. The patient was diagnosed as not suffering from any form of cancer and was therefore referred on to the “benign” gynaecology team.
 
Ms Nakafeero was advised that it was likely that the most effective treatment for her condition was a hysterectomy. It was expected that the likely wait for this treatment would be 6 months.
 
Ms Nakafeero was not allocated an appointment and therefore had not received the necessary surgery by the time of her death in June 2022. Had the surgery been undertaken it is probable that she would not have developed a pulmonary embolism.
 
Although the trust has investigated these circumstances and implemented change, no clear explanation could be offered for why the deceased slipped out of this care pathway. I am not satisfied that the risk of re-occurrence has been properly addressed.
 
2.       The clinicians treating Ms Nakafeero assessed her VTE risk utilising an established algorithm based on national guidance. The assessment was undertaken appropriately but it failed to identify two risk factors which made the formation of a DVT more likely, namely, large uterine fibroids and the use of tranexamic acid. I have concerns that the omission of these factors in the assessment criteria limited the effectiveness of the risk assessment.","On 22nd June 2022 this Court commenced an investigation into the death of Christine Nakafeero, age 56 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest between 20th and 21st July 2023.

These difficulties included self harm and suicidal ideation, as a result of command auditory hallucinations.
 
On the 2nd of May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance with a mental health crisis and suicidal ideation, [REDACTED]. He was clear that what would help him would be “to not go home” and that he did not feel safe at home. He was discharged in the absence of any comprehensive assessment, and in the absence of liaison with his family. The clinician assessing him did not have all of the important information to be able to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment, including in relation to recent incidents of self harm.
 
The deceased was seen by his care co ordinator on the 3rd of May 2022. The de- ceased again confirmed that he had drunk bleach on the command of voices, and both he and family were asking for admission. There was no comprehensive assessment. Again the clinician was not aware of important information which should have been taken into account in any assessment of risk, including in relation to self harm.
 
On the 4th of May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance [REDACTED]. He told Doctors in the Emergency Department he had done this at the command of voices, that he still felt suicidal, and if discharged he would attempt to take his life again. There was no comprehensive assessment by mental health services and the clinician was not in possession of all relevant information as to risk. The deceased was discharged on the basis that there was no indication of current suicidal ideation at the point of the assessment or objective evidence of psychosis, to his home address, where he had indicated he did not feel safe. Whilst awaiting transport the deceased left the hospital having discarded his mobile phone and was reported missing. He was assessed as medium risk by the Police in the light of information provided by mental health services which had not been up- dated and did not include all risk events.
 
Having left the hospital, the deceased fell or jumped [REDACTED] on the 5th May 2023, despite the efforts of Police officers on the scene. Kenneth’s intention cannot be established although it is known that the deceased was suffering from a deterioration in his mental health in the days leading up to his death, including evidence of auditory command hallucinations to harm himself.
 
Mental health services involved with the deceased, did not carry out comprehensive mental state assessments despite the escalating risks which were known or ought to have been known, and did not fully involve family members in care, safety and dis- charge planning, who were crucial to his safety.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
(1) The serious incident investigation report in this case was not available in this case until the 24.03.2023, over 10 months since the death and around 8 months outside the NHS framework guidance of 60 days for the completion of such, despite repeated requests and a schedule 5 notice being issued to attempt to obtain a copy of the draft report to inform this investigation, which was not complied with.","On the 16th May 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Kenneth Rippon, aged 47 years.

I recorded a narrative conclusion which included my finding that mental health services inadequate response to escalating risks, which were known or ought to have been known, including the failure to include family in assessment and safety/discharge planning contributed, more than minimally, to the death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13th September 2023.

The cause of death was multi organ failure caused by cardio respiratory arrest due to increased pressure on the lungs from abdominal distention, which itself was caused by longstanding chronic constipation and fluid build up from his laxative treatment.   ","During the course of the inquest it transpired that the condition of Shane’s abdomen was changeable. Shane’s learning disability also meant that he was reluctant to report whether he was in any discomfort thus hiding the true picture. The cause of the variable abdomen condition was due to the osmotic laxative treatment filling the abdomen with fluid thus making it distended. Shane was prescribed three sachets of laxative in the morning and three in the evening. On the 15th of August there also appeared to be an instruction for an additional 8 sachets to be administered. The nursing notes state that these were not given due to a maximum of 8 sachets being allowed over a 24 hour period, but the PAN prescription chart appear to be signed as being given. It was not clear therefore whether additional sachets were administered. In any event Professor Colin Johnson acting as an independent expert witness stated that it was not the dosage that was relevant but at what frequency it was given, whether all together or staggered over 24 hours. It was found at inquest that the conservative method of treating the constipation was appropriate and there was insufficient evidence to state that excessive laxatives had been administered, however the combination of a longstanding  constipation caused the abdomen to become distended and lose muscle mass meaning that it was inefficient at moving material along the gastro-intestinal tract. A further consequence of longstanding distention was that it was continually pressing against the diaphragm causing Shane to suffer reduced lung function. The additional distention from the colon filling with fluid as a result of the laxative treatment placed additional and unrecoverable strain upon Shane’s respiratory effort.
 
I am concerned that in cases involving patients with learning disabilities (who commonly suffer from chronic constipation) the management of laxative treatment was not monitored closely enough to ensure a safe dose of laxatives.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1.     There was a contradiction between the nursing notes and the prescription charts as to the amount of laxatives administered on the 15th and 16th of August 2018.
2.     Shane was known to hide his physical condition on questioning due to his learning disabilities and saying what he thought people wanted to hear. As such it was difficult for staff to get a true picture of Shane’s condition..
3.     Shane had ongoing respiratory compromise due to his abdominal distension pressing against his diaphragm therefore further distention posed a risk of further loss of respiratory function.
4.     It was not clear whether medical professionals appreciated this risk and whether the administering of the laxatives ought to be staggered to allow Shane to receive the prescribed dose but not to the extent of overloading his already distended abdomen with fluid","On the 20th August 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shane Luke West.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
 To the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
1.     The court heard evidence as to the barriers which exist and make it difficult for staff working on mental health wards to obtain input from physical health specialists without sending a patient to hospital via the Emergency Department.
Whilst there are occasions where review in an Emergency Department is most appropriate, the court also heard evidence that these can be extremely busy and intensive environments which may not be a conducive to delivering care for patients experiencing severe and enduring mental illness;
2.     It is a matter of concern that Mental Health Trusts and Acute Trusts operate different (apparently incompatible) electronic records systems. The absence of such a unified records system creates obstacles as to the transfer of important clinical information between mental health and physical health specialists (and vice versa), with an inherent risk to patient safety arising from such information being held in silos.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
The inquest heard evidence that to deal with the risk of falls in patients deemed to be high risk the concept of observable bay nursing had been introduced at both Trusts. At both Trusts Mrs Nickson fell whilst unobserved due to the challenges of maintaining the bays as observed bays. The challenge for both trusts had arisen where staff were required to deal with issues out of the bay and left the bay area.

He developed a urinary tract infection and required hospital treatment. He was admitted on 15th November 2022 to Wythenshawe hospital and then moved to Trafford General Hospital. He responded to treatment. To facilitate his discharge he needed additional support at home and remained in Trafford General Hospital whilst care arrangements were organised. Whilst waiting for the package of care to be put in place he developed COVID 19 in hospital. As a consequence he deteriorated and developed dysphagia as a consequence of his frailty which led to him developing aspiration pneumonia. Despite treatment he became increasingly frail. He was discharged on end of life care to Flixton Manor Nursing Home on 24th January 2023 and died there on 27th January 2023.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The inquest heard that the delayed discharge of Mr Barton from hospital was due to the challenges of putting an appropriate social care package in place. The evidence before the inquest was that delayed discharges such as Mr Barton’s put the lives of frail elderly patients at risk as it is far more likely that they will become deconditioned and develop and infection if they spend unnecessary time in hospital. The evidence was that delayed discharges such as Mr Barton’s were not uncommon due to the demand on social care and the availability of suitable care.","On 1st February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Barton. The investigation concluded on the 27th June 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from complications of aspiration pneumonia following a prolonged hospital stay contributed to by COVID which he contracted when discharge was delayed.

She was triaged at 17:52. She presented with a history of vomiting and abdominal pain. She was triaged into Category 3 (urgent) which recommends clinical assessment within 60 minutes. She was not clinically assessed until 02:46 – 9 hours after her arrival. The delay was due to the demand on the department and was not unusual at that time. The abdomen was distended and guarded. A decision was made that she needed antibiotics and a CT scan. The antibiotics were not prescribed until 04:21 and administered at 04:50. The CT scan was ordered at 04:13. The delay was due to the clinical demands on the department. The scan took place at 05:11 and at 05:44 it was reported on. The scan showed a sigmoid colon perforation. She was referred to the surgical team who saw her at 06:50. A conservative treatment plan was put in place. She was moved to a surgical ward where she began to rapidly deteriorate with her NEWS 2 score rising to 16 at 08:55. Her NEWS 2 had been 1 at triage and 3 at 23:53 and 04:13. She died at Tameside General Hospital on 17th December just after 9am from peritonitis.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
The inquest heard evidence that the very significant delay for Mrs Oldham to be seen by a clinician was due to the demand on Emergency Department Services. The inquest was told that delays of this length (9 hours) for patients who had been triaged to be seen within 60 minutes were not uncommon throughout the winter period across Greater Manchester and more widely.
 
The demand was due to the volume of patients and the number of staff available to see and treat them. The delay was compounded by the shortage of radiographers and radiologists nationally meaning that even when a decision is taken for a scan it can take some time 9 an hour in this case) for it to take place and then reported on.
 
In the time that Mrs Oldham was waiting to be seen she deteriorated very significantly meaning that by the time it was understood what the issue was she was very unwell and did not respond to conservative treatment which was all she was well enough for by that point.",On 28th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Marianne Erika Oldham. The investigation concluded on the 6th June 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of a perforation of the sigmoid colon where the perforation was not identified until 12 hours after her arrival in the Emergency Department and treatment was delayed as a consequence.

1. On the 11th May 2022 Peter Harris was admitted to Queens Hospital, Romford and was found to have a large pericardial effusion and a diagnosis of stage 4 metastatic lung cancer was made. The condition was untreatable but palliative chemotherapy was planned. However, on the 27th May 2022 and the 3rd June 2022, the Deceased was re-admitted with non- resolving pneumonia which was treated with anti-biotics. His symptoms worsened and he was found to have a recurrent pericardial effusion and, on the 5th June 2022, he was transferred to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London for a “pericardial window” to be performed. However, before going to theatre, the Deceased suffered a cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and intubated, and he underwent an emergency pericardiocentesis before transfer to the Intensive Treatment Unit. Despite support, attempts to wean the Deceased from sedation were unsuccessful, and he developed multi-organ failure and died at 17.30 hours on the 10th June 2022.
 
In 2020, whilst being investigated by the colorectal service at Queens Hospital, a CT scan performed in November 2020 raised the possibility of a malignant process in the lung but this report was not seen by the clinical team. If it had been seen, it is likely that annual review and monitoring would have been arranged and this may have enabled the lung tumour which subsequently developed to have been diagnosed and treated before it reached stage 4. There was, therefore, a lost opportunity to monitor for and, possibly, to diagnose and treat, the lung cancer. However, it is possible that the tumour, which probably developed quickly, would not have been found even by annual review. Consequently, on the evidence, it is not possible to ascertain whether monitoring probably would, or would not, have prevented the Deceased’s death.","Background:
1.     The evidence at the inquest showed that the results of two separate scans performed on the Deceased, both of which had concerning outcomes, were not seen and acted upon in a timely manner.
 
2.     First, on the 8th October 2020, a Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at Queens Hospital requested a CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax, abdomen and pelvis because the Deceased had reported significant weight loss and other symptoms. The radiologist’s report on the scan, dated the 8th November 2020, mentioned findings of multiple lung nodules and included a differential diagnosis of lung metastases. This outcome was never seen by the requesting clinician, nor any other clinician (including the Deceased’s General Practitioner). I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy; I was told that “the reporter would not raise this as an incidental finding because malignancy was already queried and would expect the referring clinician to review results”. The Consultant Colorectal Surgeon told me, however, that his understanding of the system was that he would be alerted to any finding or suspicion of malignancy. Further, although the Deceased had subsequently been given three outpatients appointments, the error was not picked up through these because all three appointments were cancelled by the hospital and the Deceased was not seen by the colorectal team again.
 
3.     Secondly, a further CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax was undertaken on the 9th April 2022, but the formal report (suspicious for lung cancer) was not made until the 24th May 2022, and this resulting in delay in the Deceased being seen on the cancer pathway by the respiratory team. It seems that the delay in reporting was because a second hospital number had been used for the Deceased when the scan was performed in an external CT scanner located on the King George Hospital site.
 
4.     At the inquest, I heard oral evidence from [REDACTED] , and I received documentary evidence, explaining the changes which have been made since the Deceased’s death. The documentation received included an 11 point Action Plan, supported by evidence as to the action that has been taken. On the basis of that evidence, I am satisfied that most of the concerns relating to the Deceased’s scan reporting and other management have been addressed.
 
5.     I do, however, have two ongoing concerns about the system in place for the communication of concerning radiological findings. Steps have been taken to improve the system previously in place. In particular, I have been provided with a copy of the Trust’s new “Radiology Unsuspected Cancers and Critical Findings Protocol” which, I am told, has now been approved, and will be adopted, by the Radiology Clinical Leads and Clinical Governance Leads across North East London. I was also told that a new electronic scan requesting and reporting system will “go live” in August 2023, and that this will enable unexpected cancers and other incidental critical findings to be “red-flagged” directly to the requesting team. The system will also have an “acknowledgment option” enabling the referring doctor to click on a read receipt for all radiology reports.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows:
Concern 1:
The Trust’s new policy is concerned with ensuring that unexpected cancer or other critical radiological findings are highlighted to the requesting team. However, the evidence at the inquest suggested that requesting team were not alerted to the suspicious outcome of the Deceased’s November 2020 scan because it was an expected finding; as stated above, I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy and the outcome was not, therefore, treated as unexpected. I am concerned, therefore, that the same could happen again, despite the changes which have been made. I did not consider that [REDACTED] was able to address this concern satisfactorily in his evidence.
 
Concern 2:
The new electronic system is introducing a “read receipt” feature which, if used, would enable identification of reports which have not been opened and read by the requesting team in a timely manner. I am concerned, however, that the use of the read receipt is optional as this will inevitably undermine the extent to which any monitoring system will be able to spot and identify unread reports. I did not consider that either [REDACTED], nor the Consultant Colorectal Surgeon from whom I heard evidence about the plans for monitoring in the surgical department of Queens Hospital, were able to address this concern satisfactorily in their evidence.","I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter John Harris, aged 73 years, who died at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London on the 10th June 2022.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.      The inquest heard evidence that Mr Amesbury needed to be referred from secondary to tertiary services within Greater Manchester. The inquest heard evidence that the speed and quality of that referral was impacted by the way in which information was shared between clinicians in different trusts within Greater Manchester. The use of different systems and reliance on postal services and lack of a clear, effective electronic system of referrals including transfer of images /notes meant there were delays in assessing patients which led to a delay in formulating a treatment plan in tertiary services;
 
2. The evidence also indicated that there were delays in patients who had been identified as requiring cardiology input being seen in cardiology clinics due to availability of clinicians/appointment slots inquest. This was exacerbated where there was a need for trans- oesophageal echocardiogram due to resource issues. The inquest heard that this type of echocardiogram could be key in understanding the cardiac issues of a patient.",On 6th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Kevin Amesbury. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13th September 2023.

She was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital following an accidental fall at her home address. It was identified that she had fractured her neck of femur. She was operated on. Post-operatively her weight was found to be low and she was referred to the dietetics team. Her nutritional status remained compromised and an Nasojejunal (NJ) tube was sited on 21st July 2022. There was a delay in utilising the NJ Tube until 29th July. The NJ feeding was subsequently stopped due to concerns of aspiration and fluid overload. It was restarted on the night of 4th August. There was a significant electrolyte imbalance, probably due to refeeding syndrome due to the issues with nutrition. On 5th August the feeding via the NJ Tube was stopped due to episodes of vomiting of blood from her gastro intestinal issues including duodenal ulcers, identified in a series of gastroscopies, probably caused by steroid treatment. She continued to become increasingly frail. She deteriorated further and died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 13th August 2022.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Mr Greenway returned home to the U.K. on 18 October, he remained unwell with diarrhoea and nausea. He spoke to his GP on 19 October who advised rest and fluids and went with [REDACTED] to a walk in centre on 21 October who advised him to attend hospital. He was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn and admitted. He was unwell with acute kidney injury and febrile. He was given IV fluids and antibiotics and urine and stool samples sent. The junior doctor clerking him did not use the clerking booklet when performing a VTE assessment which would have guided [REDACTED] to prescribe 40mg of enoxaparin an anti- coagulant, instead [REDACTED ]used the VTE assessment on the electronic prescribing system which is not as detailed as the paper clerking booklet. To prescribe anticoagulants the electronic VTE assessment has to be filled in. Despite Mr Greenway’s known risk factors of age, obesity, recent infection and loss of mobility she prescribed a “renal dose” of 20mg of enoxaparin, half the usual dose. Mr Greenway’s eGFR (measurement of renal function) was 58 and the dose of anticoagulant is only supposed to be reduced if this measurement is below 30. When spoken to after Mr Greenway’s death [REDACTED] explanation was that [REDACTED] did this in a excess of caution despite clear guidelines. Mr Greenway remained on this dose for his entire hospital stay. No senior clinician checked this prescription, the consultant who gave evidence assumed the pharmacists would have done a reconciliation. Mr Greenway was discharged and died several days later from a pulmonary embolism.
The pharmacy service at weekends at this hospital had been suspended for some time, this consultant was even aware of this.  [REDACTED] said   [REDACTED]was too busy to check individual patients’ new prescriptions on  [REDACTED] ward rounds. The pharmacy reconciliation is meant to operate as a fail safe or safety net, it is the Consultant Doctor’s responsibility to check what their junior unsupervised doctors do at the weekend when a patient is admitted. This consultant didn’t ever speak to this junior doctor about this mis-prescribing or know what action if any had been taken about it. I was informed by a senior nurse that other such drug errors have occurred since Mr Greenway died. Documentation was poor and the TRAINED NURSES are undertaking courses to show them how to complete fluid balance charts which is something I would expect them to already know how to do.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
·  Junior doctors incorrect prescribing despite clear guidelines.
·  VTE assessments not being completed on clerking a patient just on the electronic medicines prescription which is much less detailed.
·  Consultants stating it is the pharmacists’ job to check for errors when there is only a 3 day service by pharmacists to do this and it is intended as a safety net procedure only.
·  Consultants not accepting that it is their responsibility to monitor what their junior doctors are doing when prescribing new medications for patients.
· 3 different consultants seeing the same patient over 3 days, no continuity of care.
· Patients at higher risk of an embolus not being monitored correctly or at all after initial clerking.",On 3 November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Colin Vincent GREENWAY aged 63.

She returned to Tameside General Hospital with concerns over her wound. She subsequently developed a deep vein thrombosis and cellulitis. On 22nd November 2022 she became very unwell and was admitted to Intensive Care Unit with sepsis, acute kidney injury and liver failure. She was treated on the Intensive Care Unit until 26th November when she returned to the ward. She continued to be treated for her cellulitis and an ulcer of the left foot that had developed. She was stepped down to the Stamford Unit on 16th December 2022. On 22nd December 2022 she returned to Tameside General Hospital due to concerns about her raised NEWS 2 score, raised probably as a consequence of cellulitis. She was started on intravenous antibiotics. Her liver function was deranged and she had acute kidney injury. She had a catheter but her urine output was difficult to assess due to issues regarding possible catheter bypass. On 24th December, one dose of antibiotics was missed. On 25th December, two doses of antibiotics were missed. She continued to be unwell and on 27th December further antibiotics were prescribed. She was referred to the Critical Care Outreach Team who assessed and determined that Intensive Care Unit referral was not necessary. On 29th December the antibiotics were changed. There was a further referral to Critical Care Outreach that was unsuccessful as there were no staff available. There was no doctor to doctor assessment and no consultant review and no liver specialist advice sought or provided. She continued to deteriorate on 30th December with poor liver function and poor kidney function. On the morning of 31st December she deteriorated rapidly and was accepted by the Intensive Care Unit where despite aggressive treatment she deteriorated rapidly and died on 31st December 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1. Mrs Wadsworth missed three doses of antibiotics prescribed to treat her infection according to the evidence given to the inquest. This did not appear to have been escalated and there was no clear explanation regarding this occurring other than that her cannula may not have been in place and there was a delay in a doctor being available to reinsert one;
 
2. The evidence before the inquest was that on her admission over Christmas/New Year there was no effective consultant input into her care;
 
3. The junior doctor involved in her care felt that ICU involvement/input would be beneficial. The evidence was that there did not seem to be any doctor to doctor discussion of this. The inquest heard evidence that this was one way a patient could be transferred to ICU. It was unclear why there had not been such a discussion and whether in periods such as Christmas/ New Year where there were fewer consultants available the system worked effectively. This was not a situation where there had been a ward based ceiling of care put in place and ultimately Mrs Wadsworth was treated by ICU but was extremely unwell at that point and did not respond to that intervention at that point;
 
4. The alternative support available to ward based staff and possible route into ICU according to the evidence given at inquest was via the Critical Care Outreach team. That team is staffed primarily by nurses and its key focus is on presentation linked to NEWS2 scores according to the evidence given to the inquest. Mrs Wadsworth’s case was a complex one involving issues relating to her liver function and kidney function rather than just her NEWS2 scores and it was unclear if the Critical Care Outreach Team were best placed to assess her need for ICU support;
 
5. The inquest heard that on the date of one referral that team was not in any event available to the ward and the nurse who should have undertaken the role had been redeployed elsewhere in the trust and there was no capacity to fill that role;
 
6. Following her first admission to ICU there was a note that Mrs Wadsworth’s case should be discussed with a specialist Liver team. There was no evidence available to the inquest that such a discussion had taken place. It was not entirely clear on the evidence precisely which clinician was to take ownership of the action.",On 3rd January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jane Elizabeth Wadsworth .The investigation concluded on the 12th June 2023 and the conclusion was one of ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11th September 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1.  Upon RA’s arrival back at the Nursing Home on 2nd August, staff immediately raised a Safeguarding concern in respect of, inter alia, his genitals being covered in a white “cheese” like substance with, additionally, faecal matter in his pubic hair; extensive areas of flaking skin including behind his ears was also identified. Colour photographs were taken and provided to the Trust along with the Safeguarding documentation. Objectively, the photographs clearly documented the flaking skin and white “cheese” like material covering RA’s penis.
 
2.  Evidence confirmed that the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, responsible for Basildon Hospital, carried out a significantly flawed RCA investigation which effectively rejected any suggestions of shortcoming in care, management and treatment. The Ward Matron (responsible for the ward concerned) was the co-author responsible for the RCA Report. [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest that she had not been provided with the photographs provided by the Nursing Home and RA’s daughter until just two weeks prior to the inquest hearing.  (It was noted and accepted that even when [REDACTED] had seen the photographs neither nor the Trust had seen fit to draw this to HMC’s attention or to provide either an addendum statement or a revised RCA).
 
3. The Trust’s responsible Adult Safeguarding Lead provided a statement in which [REDACTED] confirmed that, notwithstanding the photos having been expressly noted in the original Safeguarding referral and raised in subsequent correspondence and meetings with the Thurrock Local Authority Safeguarding Team, [REDACTED] had not made the photos available for the purposes of the RCA. [REDACTED] was unable to provide any explanation at all for this failure. This lack of professionalism was and remains a grave cause for concern resulting as it did in a seriously flawed Trust investigation, which itself fed into the Thurrock Adult Safeguarding investigation and, further still, a wider section 42 systemic investigation involving RA’s case and two others to which a range of stakeholders contributed. It was accepted by the Trust witnesses that but for the coronial investigation, the denials of any Trust failings would have remained unchallenged perpetuating a false record of the basic nursing care provided (or not provided) to the highly vulnerable and dependent RA.
 
4. The evidence heard at the inquest undermined the following erroneous findings of the RCA:
·  In response to the concern that RA had extensive flakes of fungal growth behind his ears the RCA concluded that “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation supports regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”
 
·  In respect to the concern that RA’s foreskin/genitals were covered in flakes and what appeared to be “cheese / paste” the RCA asserted that there were “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation support regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”","On 3rd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ronald Scott Ashdown, aged 55 years.

His mother was attended by paramedics, but really what she needed was early hospital obstetric care.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
That Phoenix’ death was and remains utterly devastating for his parents is unsurprising. However, it was clear at inquest that it was also deeply shocking for those trying to care for him and his mum. Events were outside the experience of several of the healthcare professionals involved.
 
I heard at inquest that new national maternity guidance is to be published at the end of the month. This will include within it revised advice for paramedics faced with an unplanned home delivery such as this one to transport to hospital even if birth is imminent. I was assured at inquest that the advice will quickly be disseminated.
 
Had I not been given this information, I would have made a prevention of future deaths report to the ambulance service.
 
It is of course of the utmost importance that hospital clinicians and ambulance clinicians have the same understanding of how a patient in any given situation should be treated, and I have copied this report to the London Ambulance Service (LAS).
 
The reason I make a report to the Homerton, is because it seemed to me at inquest that there were two matters that had not yet been resolved.
 
i)  At inquest, there was not a shared understanding among the clinicians within the trust about how such a situation should be approached.
 
The obstetricians were clear that, given her very high risk status, Phoenix’ mum needed to come in to hospital as soon as she showed the first signs of labour. And even if she had started to deliver, she could still only be treated effectively and Phoenix given the best chance of a good outcome in hospital.","On 3 August 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Phoenix Chapman, a baby who died less than six weeks after he was born. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 July 2023. I made a determination at inquest of death by natural causes.   ","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11 September 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
Although I was somewhat reassured to learn that the relevant Regulations have been revised and strengthened since these events, I am concerned that in this case (and, therefore, possibly in other cases) the Agency did not establish or apply a clear threshold in determining the need for a full stability assessment to be performed following significant modifications to the vessel. Too much reliance was placed on: (1) reassurances offered by the skipper of the vessel in relation to his appreciation of risk and/or his operational intentions (notably about the size and distribution of the load); and (2) informal visual assessments of the impact of the modifications which were undertaken whilst the vessel was in dock and was not under loaded conditions.
 
In addition, insufficient concern arose from the issues identified on the two occasions when Holyhead Coastguard advised the Agency of the need to rescue the vessel following breakdowns at sea.
 
I am concerned that other vessels (whether or a similar size or otherwise) may be operating, which have been modified since the issue of the original safety certificate and which require a full stability assessment before their operational safety can be properly evaluated.","On 14 July 2023, sitting with a jury, I heard simultaneously the inquests into the deaths of three men (Ross Stephen Ballatine, Carl Stephen McGrath, Alan Wallace Minard), each of whom died from immersion/drowning after the fishing vessel on which they were working (Nicola Faith) capsized off the coast of North Wales on 27 January 2021.   In each case the jury returned a narrative conclusion in the same terms: ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11th of September 2023 I, the coroner, may extend the period.

When Mr Burns was transferred to Blackpool Victoria Hospital, his dietary requirements were not notified to North West Ambulance Services.

He underwent surgery on 18 October 2022 to remove the tumour. This was surgically uneventful. Post-operatively, he required a lengthy period of intensive care. On the 19 December 2022 he was stepped down from intensive care to a ward. He was at a very high risk of developing a thromboembolism due to his cancer diagnosis, recent surgery, lengthy period in hospital and immobility. During the period of 9 to 15 January 2023 he refused his anti- coagulation medication on three occasions. The reason for refusal is unclear and there is no documented evidence that the risk of non-compliance with the medication was explained to him or escalated to the medical team. On the 20 January 2023, Mr. James suffered from an acute deterioration in his health, culminating in a cardiac arrest. He passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on the 21 January 2023 from a pulmonary embolism. The missing doses of anticoagulation during the two weeks leading up to his death is likely to have contributed to a degree, to the development of the pulmonary embolism.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The refusal of anti-coagulation medication was not brought to the attention of medical staff. The administration of anti-coagulation medication to patients like Mr James, is vital for reducing the risk of a venous thrombo-embolism, a potentially life-threatening condition. There is no electronic prompt/alert to highlight to the medical team when prescribed anticoagulation medication is not administered.
 
The Trust’s internal investigator recognised that a fail-safe should be put in place within the electronic records, to ensure escalation to the medical team where doses of prescribed anti- coagulation are not administered. Such a measure could prevent similar deaths from occurring. It was considered that this measure could assist in preventing future deaths not just locally, but at a wider level.",On 16 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr John Michael James.

An ambulance was called by his sister when she arrived at the property but sadly he was confirmed deceased at 02.09. He had been seen by his sister the day before when he was noted to be well. He had been diagnosed with treatment resistant schizophrenia and depression and had been under the care of Mental health team since 1997. He was established on clozapine in 2004 which requires monthly monitoring due to its potential toxic effects. His clozapine level was 904 ug/L on 03/05/22. ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.       Monitoring clozapine levels: The inquest heard evidence that there was a clear system to monitor monthly blood test results looking for low white cell count, however there was no clear system for monitoring the actual clozapine and nor clozapine levels. In addition the inquest heard how there was no safe system to communicate high levels of clozapine.
 
2.       Medication changes: After a review on 14/10/22, when a high level of clozapine was noted from a blood test on 03/05/22, the consultant indicated that medication should reduce on the next prescription. This was communicated by email to the care coordinator however this was not read or acted upon. The inquest heard how there was no safe system to effect medication changes.
 
3.       How to record high clozapine levels: The clozapine and nor clozapine levels are recorded in the pharmacy section of the records. There was no system for highlighting high clozapine results in the rio notes which are routinely used by all clinicians.
 
4.       Understanding of clozapine: I heard evidence that there was a lack of understanding of when to measure clozapine levels, how to interpret high clozapine levels and then how to respond to a high level.
 
5.       August 2020 Regulation 28 report: I sent a Regulation 28 report in August 2020 (case of Ian Allen) which identified that there was no system in place to ensure abnormal clozapine levels were escalated and acted upon and that there was a lack of understanding of the importance of clozapine monitoring and how frequently levels should be monitored. Given this report there is a concern that the Trust has not learnt from the previous Regulation 28 report.
 
6.       Quality of the internal investigation process: The initial investigation report did not raise significant issues regarding the monitoring of clozapine and importantly whether Mr Hussain did in fact have toxicity. It was only when [REDACTED] wrote a report on 26/03/23 (7months after the death) that this issue was highlighted and addressed. This raises a concern about the quality of the internal investigation process and whether it is able to identify central issues in a particular case.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Preamble 
During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashton’s gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time.
 
During the ‘relevant period’ examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton’s death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as ‘player protection tools’, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him.
 
Concerns
1)    I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler.
 
2)     I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally.
 
3)     I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers.",On 06 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Luke Anthony Ashton aged 40.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows 
 
This is a further Report, of several by me, as both Senior Coroner for North West Wales and Assistant Coroner for North Wales East & Central relating to matters of ambulance delays and inability to offload patients in a timely manner into Emergency Departments across North Wales.
 
Evidence was heard at the Inquest that the initial delays experienced by Mary Elizabeth Jones whilst awaiting an ambulance and waiting in the rear of the ambulance possibly contributed indirectly to her existing frailty. Whilst not in themselves causative of Mrs Jones’ death it remains a significant concern that despite evidence of improvements by the Health Board and WAST upon which I have previously been provided, that even as recently as December 2022, unacceptably lengthy delays remain such as in the case of Mary Elizabeth Jones.
 
I have still not been presented with any meaningful evidence on the involvement of Local Authorities in the considerations by WAST and BCUHB of lack of patient flow due to social care deficiencies.",On 19 January 2023 an investigation was commenced into the death of Mary Elizabeth Jones (DOB 30/12/36) who died on 14 January 2023.

An employee from a pharmacy delivery centre located him and assisted him to a chair. He was complaining of a leg injury and resisted her efforts to call an ambulance. The emergency services were not called. A note was left by the pharmacy delivery agent to say that Mr Wilberforce had had a fall.  She left the premises.  ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
(1)    The pharmacy delivery agent attended upon Mr Wilberforce at his home address to deliver his prescription. He had fallen inside the home address and support was provided to him by her. Mr Wilberforce had resisted her attempts to contact the emergency services. Mr Wilberforce was also moved, with the assistance of the prescription delivery agent, from the floor without having been subjected to a medical examination. The prescription delivery agent was, further, unaware of the status of Mr Wilberforce in respect of his dementia.
 
(2)    Evidence was provided on behalf of the pharmacy that there was no training provided to staff members in respect of how to deal with and what actions should be taken when a service user is found to have had a fall at their home address by a pharmacy delivery agent. Evidence was also heard that the majority of service users were elderly persons.
 
(3) I am concerned that a lack of clarity exists in respect of the roles and responsibilities of persons attending upon the home addresses of elderly service users, particularly in the context of what action should be taken when someone is found to have fallen.","On 10 February 2023, I commenced an investigation into the death of Harold Wilberforce, aged 87 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows –
 
·       There is limited evidence to date of improved communication, and a stronger working relationship, between the stroke team and the neurosurgical team at the Trust
 
·       There is limited evidence to date of the Stroke team having a clear understanding of the NICE guidance regarding Decompression Craniectomy, specifically the importance of detailed careful monitoring post stroke, with clarity about referral criteria to Neurosurgery. The planned Standard Operating Procedure, which may set out this clarity is not yet finalised.
 
·       There are currently limited opportunities for joint case discussion and learning between the Stroke and Neurosurgical teams. The Interventional Neuroradiologists could of course also usefully participate in such Educational opportunities – I note it was [REDACTED], (Consultant in Interventional Neuroradiology) rather than the Stroke team, who asked that Gordon was reviewed by the Neurosurgical team on the early evening of the 7th June 2022

For a variety of reasons, a home birth was against medical advice, this had been explained on a number of occasions throughout the pregnancy. On the 17th December 2021 advice to transfer to hospital had been given by midwives during early labour due to concerns that Sinon’s mother was showing signs of pre-eclampsia and due to findings of light meconium staining on rupture of membranes which could indicate fetal distress. This advice was not accepted. At 12:47 it was identified that Sinon maybe an undiagnosed breech presentation, transfer to hospital was recommended and declined. Up to that time presentation based on abdominal palpitation and vaginal examinations had been assessed as cephalic. A frank breech presentation was confirmed during a 999 call commencing at 13:00. Paramedics arrived at scene at 13:07 and transfer to hospital was again advised and not accepted. The presenting part delivered at 13:14, there was then a 27 minute period before delivery of Sinon’s head causing a catastrophic hypoxic brain injury. He received resuscitation and was transferred to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital arriving at 49 minutes of age. At 57 minutes Sinon was found to have a heartbeat, he was ventilated and cooled but remained comatose and subsequently developed signs of encephalopathy and multi organ failure, a decision was made to provide palliative care on the 20th December and Sinon died at 05:15 on the 21st December 2021.   ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows 
1. The University Hospitals of Birmingham NHS Foundations Trust (‘UHB’) has specific guidance covering home birth against medical advice in the form of ‘Birth Choices Guidance, CG1200, June 2021’ and ‘Homebirth Including Risk Assessment, CG1143, August 2021’.
 
2. Specifically, Section 5 of the Birth Choices Guidance includes:
 
“5.1 All women requesting birth outside of guidance must be referred for discussion to the consultant midwife via BadgerNet for decision-making regarding their birth choices.
….
5.7.  Where there are complexities that require the input of other professionals and if the woman remains undecided or voices a decisive choice to pursue a plan outside of Trust guidance a joint multiprofessional appointment must be arranged.
5.8.  This appointment should include the consultant midwife; the woman’s named obstetric consultant and other relevant professionals/clinicians as needed. The consultant midwife will convene the multiprofessional team meeting with the purpose of ensuring that a comprehensive multiprofessional pregnancy and birth plan is formulated.
5.9.  There may be occasions when the multiprofessional team cannot meet. In these circumstances it is acceptable for the multiprofessional team to see the woman separately. However, the team members must still agree a plan together and document this on the woman’s records.”
 
3. Evidence given at the inquest pertaining to the current situation was that the system outlined in section 5.8 of the Birth Choices Guidance is not in operation at all. Evidence was given by UHB’s Community Matron that without the input of a Consultant Obstetrician at the multiprofessional appointment, things might be missed in the birth plan, and the information given by the Consultant Midwife and Community Midwives may not carry the same weight with the patient as hearing the opinion of the Consultant Obstetrician. It was stated in evidence by the Community Matron that this could put the lives of Mums and babies at risk.",On 30 December 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sinon MASHA.

The conclusion of the inquest was:   Natural causes.,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 30 August 2023.

He was a serving prisoner with a sentence expiry in 2024. He had ADHD and ASD for which he was medicated with mirtazapine administered by healthcare and at the time of his death atomoxetine, held in possession. He had 19 previous ACCTs for self harm and an attempt at suspension whilst serving his sentence at other establishments. Following his transfer he informed prison staff that he was in fear of other prisoners and wanted a move to another wing. He caused a superficial cut to his hand and said that he wanted to kill himself before anyone else did. An ACCT was not opened, the evidence being that officers after further speaking to him did not regard this as a self harm issue, the focus being to engineer a wing move. He was moved to a different wing but continued to express concerns about prisoners on the new wing. A self seclusion document was opened, a local policy closely aligned to the ACCT process aimed at reintegrating the prisoner to the regime was started but was not managed in accordance with the policy with assessments and reviews being done weeks after they should have been and no management plan were not put in place. Required daily interactions were sometimes done, sometimes not, referrals to psychology and SOS were either not made having been identified as necessary through the self seclusion, CSIP and SIM processes or made and not actioned","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The failure to provide adequate physiological support through SOS and/or a psychologist possibly contributed to the death. Other issues which were deemed to be relevant to the circumstances of the death but could not possibly contribute to the death were as follows. 
1. Failure to open an ACCT on or after 16th April. 
2. Failure to instigate a care plan 
3. Inadequate response to missed medication from 16th April onwards.

•       That there should be a strategy for engagement with the family.
•       That every patient should have access to 24-hour Crisis Support Neither of these key components of care were available to Kaye.

She was assessed as being suitable for step 4 therapy. However at the time of the assessment of her need there was a 2 year waiting list to access therapy. On the balance of probabilities this delay possibly contributed to her death. On 11th April 2019, 17th July 2019, 28th July 2019, 17th January 2020 and 8th May 2020 she was dealt with by British Transport Police (BTP) and indicated suicidal thoughts. Following the incident on 8th May 2020 BTP prosecuted her for obstructing the railways when she had indicated she had suicidal ideation at the time she was on the railway. She was subsequently arrested on a warrant and held in custody before being sentenced. On the balance of probabilities this decision to prosecute possibly contributed to the deterioration in her mental health and her subsequent death. On 1st August 2020 following calls to the mental health crisis line she was referred for a mental health assessment by the Primary Care Mental Health Team (PCMHT) part of Cheshire & Wirral partnership NHS Trust (CWP). On 3rd September 2020 she was assessed by telephone by the PCMHT and then the case was referred to the PCMHT MDT. On 6th September she rang Cheshire Police from Delamere Forrest with suicidal thoughts. She was taken to Hospital and discharged the following day. On 9th September 2020 her case was considered by the PCMHT MDT. They determined her needs were too complex for the PCMHT and she was to be referred to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) part of CWP. The referral was not made until 16th September 2020. At the point of referral she was discharged from the PCMHT caseload. On 17th September 2020 she presented at Stepping Hill Hospital with suicidal thoughts. She was assessed by mental health services and discharged. On 23rd September 2020 she was discussed at the CMHT MDT where the referral was rejected and she was to be referred back to the PCMHT. She was discharged from the CMHT caseload at that point. She was no longer on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT. Despite the complexity of her needs and her deteriorating mental health there was no discussion between the PCMHT and the CMHT in relation as to how to manage or mitigate the risk at this point although it was documented that she felt rejected by mental health services. On the balance of probabilities the poor communication between the PCMHT and the CMHT, the failure to assess risk effectively to ensure she remained on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT probably contributed to the further decline in her mental health and her death.

On the 10 July 2022 he also presented with lower abdominal pain, lower back pain and pain in the top of his right leg. He was recognised as being critically unwell and the emergency department requested transfer to the intensive care unit. There was a delay in transferring Matthew to intensive care. He should have been transferred by 2230 on the 10 July 2022, but was not transferred until 0930 on the 11 July 2023. Matthew’s family observed that only one of two bottles of antibiotics prescribed to Matthew in A&E were administered to him. Matthew was not observed as closely as he should have been, given his very concerning clinical condition and there were delays in carrying out necessary blood tests and in commencing renal replacement therapy. The inquest has found however that Matthew presented to hospital on the 10 July 2022 with a likely acute kidney injury, associated with sepsis. As such, his prognosis was very poor, even with optimal treatment. There is no evidence that the failings in the care provided to him contributed to his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
A concern arose at the Inquest hearing in relation to the lack of a contingency plan in place to ensure that intensive care is provided to all patients who require it, but where the intensive care unit itself is full. The Inquest heard evidence from an independent consultant anaesthetist who stated:
 
I do not understand why one or two of the 8 ICU patients who were deemed to be wardable, could not have been moved elsewhere (e.g. to a post anaesthetic care unit in an operating suite), to enable a sick patient such as Mr Phipps to be admitted to the ICU. It is my understanding that most ICUs have such contingency plans in place, in the form of agreed standard operating procedures.
 
The Trust were aware of this concern, but did not provide any evidence to address this.","On 4 October 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Matthew John Phipps, aged 56 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 26 June 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Patients who attend a Hospital Accident and Emergency Department with mental health difficulties are in most hospitals seen by a Mental Health Liaison team (made up of Consultant Psychiatrists and Mental Health nurses) These staff are not employed by the Acute Hospital Trust but are employed by a local Mental Health Trust (in this particular case it was the Sussex Partnership Foundation Trust).
 
As a result of their employment status the Mental Health Liaison team (who have the best knowledge of the patient having been caring for them) cannot invoke the Doctors or Nurses holding powers under Section 5(2) Mental Health Act (Section 5(4) for nurses). If a patient decides to abscond from the Acute Trust Hospital the Mental Health staff cannot detain/hold the patient. They would have to ask a Doctor within the Acute Hospital to do so. This Doctor may not have any knowledge of the patient and would be unlikely to act immediately in a busy A&E. By that time the patient would have been long gone.
 
Due to this technical issue around the employment status of the Mental Health Team, those suffering with a deteriorating mental health in an acute setting are at risk in these circumstances.","On 30th July 2020 Ms Hamilton-Deeley, the former Senior Coroner, commenced an investigation into the death of Rachel Kathleen Garrett aged 22 years.

She was known to suffer from constipation and diverticulitis, hypertension, arthritis and had a previous hysterectomy. All tests were normal and she was reviewed by the OPAL team at 12.15 when she was noted to be pain free so she was discharged home at 15.15. She reattended the emergency department on 29/10/22 and was referred to the surgical team who reviewed her at 11.30. She complained of colicky abdominal pain and was passing wind but had not had bowels open for 4 days. She was complaining of severe pain but had normal observations and the initial diagnosis was acute diverticulitis. However the doctor was contemplating CT scan but incorrectly decided to wait for blood test results before proceeding. Due to workload the doctor came to review blood tests results at 20.00 but which time she had self discharged. These showed a slightly raised white cell count however the clinical decision at time was that she did not need to be recalled. During this attendance no clear plan was set out in the records about how to proceed with her care and the extent of her pain coupled with reattendance was not identified as indicating she was a high risk patient and her case was not escalated for consultant review. On balance a CT scan should have been arranged at this time which would have identified the condition and provided an opportunity for earlier surgery. She represented on 30/10/22 shocked and profoundly unwell with suspicion of an ischaemic bowel which was confirmed on CT scan and found to be due to adhesions constricting the bowel from previous hysterectomy surgery. She was rushed to theatre where the ischaemic bowel was resected; however, she failed to recover and sadly passed away on 31/10/22.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
 
(1)  Evidence was heard that, on this particular stretch/bend of the A1033, there have been 3 incidents that have occurred within a short space of time.
·   A fatality leading to the death of Mr Littlewood in July 2022.
·   A fatality leading to the death of another male in November 2022.
·   An incident involving a farm vehicle which shed its load in late June/early July 2022 (very little details are known of this, suffice that it occurred near the location of the bend in the road where Mr Littlewood died, albeit on the opposite side).
I do acknowledge that each of these incidents are completely different scenarios.
It may be worthwhile to note that it is local road users that have been involved in all the incidents.
 
(2) During evidence it was heard that signage and road markings have been discussed between the police and Highways that may make the road safer. Some signage had been put in place but an assessment needs to be completed for additional road markings and the timings for this were unclear. I am aware that after every fatality in this area the police and the Highways liaise with each other over signage/road markings as a matter of course.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1. The GP practice uses EMIS for patient records and prescribing. From the evidence it appears that when one doctor ends a repeat prescription on EMIS, it remains in the ‘pending’ Medication Management box of the doctor to whom it was originally sent. Creating the risk, as in this case, that as a pending prescription it is actioned and issued instead of cancelled.
 
2. I heard evidence that the EMIS system appears to group prescriptions into the amount prescribed rather than simply recording when a prescription is issued. In this case there were different entries grouped as 100 tablets, 50 tablets, 30 tablets, and 24 tablets. Consequently, it was not clear to the duty doctor that the most recent prescriptions for co-codamol had been for a shorter course of only [REDACTED] tablets and as a result [REDACTED] tablets of co-codamol were prescribed and issued.
 
3. Evidence was given by the GP practice that to interrogate the EMIS system in order to ascertain what had actually been prescribed, issued and when, was a challenging task; it had taken 3 GPs and the in-house pharmacist to conduct the review.",An inquest into the death of Matthew William Thomas Power was opened on 29 September 2022 and resumed and concluded on 14 June 2023.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe youhave the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 August 2023.

He had attended on the 9th July 2022 after visiting the nearby Urgent Care Centre (UCC) and being referred to ED by the GP there. He was provided with a printout of his consultation with her. She was worried about him. That communication detailed his complaint of loose stools and abdominal pain. The triage nurse did not record the content of the UCC letter accurately and took that letter from Mr Blewitt. He later saw the ED doctor who did not see or read the UCC letter or attempt to source it. The ED doctor did not record any questions relating to bowel habit on his contemporaneous note, but sometime subsequent to Mr Blewitt’s death wrote a statement in which he identified that he had and that there were no bowel complaints. This was despite several days of being faecally incontinent at home and highlighting this to the UCC doctor. The ED doctor sent him home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant or recurrent urinary tract infection even though the MSU taken by his GP a few days earlier and available to the UCC doctor showed no growth. Mr Blewitt, even though he was sent home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant urinary tract infection on the 9th July 2022, was told to continue the original antibiotics his GP had started him on and then to start the new ones the next day. Mr Blewitt spent a difficult two days with faecal incontinence and abdominal pain before returning on the 11th July 2022 to the ED. At this visit a possible acute abdomen was diagnosed and CT scanning confirmed this. He was taken to theatre and suffered a cardiac arrest before surgery and died the next day on ITU. It emerged in evidence that there were no reliable records of any fluid resuscitation in the ED available for examination. This is because the computerised system records the prescription of IV fluids but unless the prescription is signed, that prescribed item is erased. The best information I received was that he had received two litres of an unknown fluid at some point during his time in the ED. It seems that doctors were not as a routine signing the prescriptions and so no reliable record was retained. I was told that doctors had been reminded on the need to sign prescriptions but no audit of this had been carried out since Mr Blewitt’s death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
[1]  At the time of Mr Blewitt’s death there was no effective, reliable recording of intravenous fluids administered to patients in the emergency department. That in my view has potential to represent a threat to the safety and lives of patients suffering with a wide variety of different conditions. The author of the SI report who attended to give evidence did not, at the time of Inquest 8 months later, was unable to demonstrate that the Trust had remedied that.
[2]  Despite the 8 month interval between Mr Blewitt’s death and the Inquest the issues of concern had not been brought to the attention of hospital authorities.
[3]  On arrival at the ED a triage nurse summarised the communication from the urgent care centre. The triage nurse missed important points during the transcription. The attending doctor did not concern himself to look at the communication himself.
[4]  I was concerned that the treating doctor made a contemporaneous note on the 9th July 2022 at Mr Blewitt’s first presentation which failed to record the major presenting symptom, diarrhoea with faecal incontinence, which Mr Blewitt had communicated to the urgent care doctor who in turn had included that in her notes and letter to the ED. The treating doctor did record a flatly contradictory note to the effect there was no change in bowel habit.
[5] The Incident Investigation Report which is in part designed to assist with learning from adverse events was of a generally poor standard. There was a failure to consider issues in detail; there was a failure to challenge the statements of clinicians where there were obvious contradictions between statements made and the medical record; there was a failure to put in place measures to correct and monitor prescribing clinicians failure to sign off on IV fluid prescriptions so that the contemporaneous record would be available for clinicians coming after them and they could see whether a patient had satisfactory or unsatisfactory fluid management. The only record in the case was a typed note by a junior doctor to the effect that it was thought Mr Blewitt had received 2 litres of fluid since arrival.",On 20 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alexander Shone BLEWITT aged 48.

Her death in hospital on 23 February 2022 happened after she jumped [REDACTED] on 16 February 2022.   ,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The concerns arising out of this investigation and inquest relate to the following key areas,
a)  Safeguarding
b)  Mental health provision
c)  Inter-agency communication – particularly where there is some doubt over who should provide additional support needed by a person.
 
We heard in evidence that in the months after Lucy’s death, a Safeguarding Adults Board considered the case, but did not consider that a Safeguarding Adults Review (‘SAR’) should be undertaken. Evidence from Wokingham Borough Council was that they were not at that time aware of the number of safeguarding referrals that had been made.
 
A decision was made (some six days before the inquest) that a SAR will now be conducted. The evidence of the Assistant Director of Adult Social Care was that this is likely to be completed within 1-3 months after the inquest.
 
I have set out the issues / concerns that I have for each of the two recipients of this report, below.
 
Reading Borough Council
1)  Time scales for review and triage of safeguarding referrals.
2)  Requirements to speak to the individual about whom safeguarding concerns have been raised.
3)  Training around Section 42 and when a report meets the threshold for neglect or abuse. This training should also consider what options are available if a concern does not meet the threshold for a Section 42 enquiry.
4)  Systems for making other involved agencies aware of safeguarding referrals and concerns.
5)  In relation to each of the above points, whether RBC should reflect the above changes in formal (written) policy, as well as delivering training.
6)  Improving interaction amongst agencies involved, and consideration of the threshold for arranging joint meetings to discuss service users, whether they meet Section 42 thresholds or not. The evidence we heard is that this is now being actively encouraged. Should there be written guidance about this somewhat subjective issue ?
7)  Whether they consider that the resourcing of this service is adequate and safe.
8)  Systems for auditing, and what will happen if the auditing reveals ongoing issues.
 
Berkshire Health Care
1)  How do the changes/proposed changes to systems (including the ‘One Team’ approach) make a difference? Specifically:
a)  Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would not be discharged from the crisis team without additional support, as she was on 2nd February?
b)  Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would be offered some support, whether by the crisis team or otherwise, in the situation that arose on the 15th February?
 
2) Do they consider that resourcing of these services is adequate and safe?","I conducted an inquest into the death of Lucy Anne Walles, which concluded on 16th June 2023. I recorded a conclusion of suicide. ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"A response to a regulation 28 report is usually required within 56 days of the date of the report.

Ms Shafighian was assessed by a specialist ENT trainee on 3/2/2020 who ordered a CT scan, which found no evidence of laryngeal cancer. Maria was diagnosed with vocal cord palsy and referred to the Speech and Language Therapists (SALT).   ","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  
During the inquest I heard that the process by which the SALT team notified the ENT department of the change in Maria’s presentation and the development of dysphagia was through an internal postal system. Following assessment by SALT on 4/5/2020, a letter was written to the ENT team which was printed and left in a pigeon hole.
 
No evidence was forthcoming to describe a system whereby urgent matters would be brought immediately to the attention of the referring team and there was no process for ensuring that the post was dealt with in a timely manner.
 
In Maria’s case there appears to have been a delay of a month between the letter being sent and being noticed by the ENT team.","On 10/12/2020 an investigation was opened into the death of Maria Christine Shafighian.

In the period that followed there were two serious attempts at overdose both of which resulted in lengthy admissions into ICU.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The Trust has conducted a PSIR the contents of which were reviewed at inquest. The report reached conclusions I found entirely reasonable. I also heard from [REDACTED] about the steps that are being taken to implement the changes felt to be appropriate. This includes a change to the consultant model with one consultant now responsible for the individual wards. There is also an initiative to standardise documentation, for example, at handover, and later MDT (when risks are reviewed), to ensure this is incorporated into RiO, together with an express intention to involve the family in decision-making. It was accepted that risk should be assessed by a nurse prior to granting leave to an informal patient particularly where unescorted leave is being considered for the first time.
 
Although Chris’s death occurred in February 2022, it also became clear that the process had not been completed. It was hoped this could be achieved by the end of July this year but the inquest was told there would need to be consideration of the proposals by the different consultants now involved. I was concerned to ensure that the process was completed without undue delay and it is with this in mind that I now write to you.","On 21/6/23, I concluded an inquest into the death of Christopher Stevens, aged 58, who was found deceased on 11/2/22.

Paramedics arrived at 08:12 and confirmed that she had died. It took 13 hours and 3 minutes from the initial call for paramedics to arrive. Cardiology evidence indicated that had Mrs Frickel received timely medical treatment then her life may have been prolonged by several weeks.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
There was evidence from WAST and BCUHB that improvements had been made internally within their organisations. It seems that patient flow i.e. those patients who are ready to be discharged from hospital but are unable to be discharged due to insufficiencies in social care means that ambulances are unable to offload patients into the Emergency Department which then causes the community delays as ambulances are not readily available.
 
I have not been presented with any meaningful evidence on the involvement of Local Authorities in the considerations by WAST and BCUHB of lack of patient flow due to social care deficiencies.
 
I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to BCUHB and WAST pertaining to the length of time it is taking for ambulances to arrive to patients (as well as handover at hospitals).
 
I remain significantly concerned that delays are continuing and that deaths will continue to occur into the future.
 
Specifically, I require responses to the following: 
1.      Extent of working relationship between WAST, BCU and North Wales Local Authorities to address the above issues; and
2.      Extent of progress between WAST, BCU and North Wales Local Authorities in addressing the above issues; and

Her father had called the crisis line in desperation the day before. His call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved. It is unclear whether any alternative action by the crisis team would have changed the outcome.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
1. I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that [REDACTED] made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died.
 
The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to [REDACTED] ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis.
 
In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations. [REDACTED] was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter’s mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled.
 
The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively.
 
I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts.
 
· This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line.
 
· Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz’s death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper.
 
When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance.","On 25 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Freeda Glausiusz, aged 32 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday.
 
I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide whilst suffering a psychotic episode.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 20 December 2021.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:
 
1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.
 
2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.
 
3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.
 
4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.
 
5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.
 
6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.
 
7.  Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.
 
8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.
 
9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.
 
10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.
 
The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.","On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021 [REDACTED].
 
The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.
 
I made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:
 
1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
 
2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.
 
3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.
 
4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.
 
5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.
 
6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.
 
7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.
 
8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.
 
9.  At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased’s home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4th August 2023.

She was operated on for a fracture to the neck of femur. Post-operatively she developed pneumonia. Subsequently the wound became infected, and a wound wash and debridement took place. She became increasingly frail. She was discharged home with support from the discharge to assess team. She felt unwell on 13th December 2022 and called for an ambulance with chest pains. Her initial call was dealt with as a category 5 call, and she contacted her GP. Her GP visited her and was concerned about her presentation. A further call to the ambulance service resulted in her being classified as a category 2 call. The blood tests taken indicated she was in severe heart failure and at a risk of a myocardial infarction. The ambulance arrived significantly outside the target Department of Health response times. The ambulance crew identified she needed urgent cardiac treatment and she was for transfer to hospital. Enroute to hospital she deteriorated further and died in the ambulance from complications of heart failure.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
 
The inquest heard evidence that under the Department of Health’s Ambulance Response time criteria, a category 2 call should have an average response time of 18 minutes and be within 40 minutes in 9 out of 10 cases.
 
The evidence before the inquest was that in her case the response time on the category 2 call was 1 hour and 5 minutes – significantly outside the target time. A response within the target time would have meant that she would not have deteriorated and died in the ambulance. She would have been in a hospital with access to treatment available in such a setting.
 
The evidence before the inquest was that her case was not a one off and delays of this nature had been occurring throughout the day. The mean time for Category 2 response times that day was 1 hour and 22 minutes and the 90th percentile was just over 3 hours.
 
At 17.58 that day there were 142 emergencies waiting in Greater Manchester alone and 430 across the North West. The average response time at that point for Category 2 patients was 2 hours and 33 minutes.
The inquest heard that the cause of these significant delays in patients receiving care in a timely manner was multifactorial and included the demand for ambulances across Greater Manchester and the North West and the long ambulance delays at A and E departments due to the demand on A and E services.",On 19th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joan Mary Corcoran.

You provided a statement regarding the care given to Ms Coogan by you and your colleagues at the Ritchie Street Group Practice.

ELFT contacted the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) at 3.17pm, but by 3.58pm, Ms Findlay had been found by a member of the public in a nearby park.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight.

care, but this was not provided until she was in a peri-arrest state at around 0330 on 25 June 2021. Raquel suffered a cardiac arrest at around 0400 and received resuscitation and thrombolysis. Sadly, there was no response to the emergency efforts and Raquel passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on 25 June 2021. Had Raquel received the D Dimer test on the 23 June 2021, in accordance with the Trust’s policy, this is likely to have triggered further investigations which would have resulted in a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and a treatment dose of lower molecular weight heparin. On the balance of probabilities this would have prevented Raquel’s death on the 25 June 2021.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1. There was a lack of thorough history taking and a number of assumptions were made on the basis of Raquel’s high BMI. There was an assumed chronic low oxygen saturation with no evidence that the doctors had checked the records available or asked the patient about her baseline. The oxygen saturations recorded in the Barts sleep apnoea clinic in 2015 and 2016 were noted to be 99% and 100%.
 
2. There was a lack of escalation of monitoring following the NEWS score of 10. It is of concern that the NEWS policy was not complied with by the nursing staff.
 
There was disagreement between senior clinicians as to how the Trust’s PE policy should have been applied. The policy is often not used in accordance with the specific wording. For example, the requirement for pleuritic chest pain is often ignored in practice. A senior clinician within the Trust considered that the caveat for pleuritic chest pain in the policy should be reviewed. In addition, the senior clinician described some of the wording in the policy as “clumsy”. In light of this, the Trust may wish to review the policy.","On the 26th July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raquel Mellonie Harper, aged 33 years.

There were no complications during the surgery nor in her post- operative care leading to discharge to Ripley Rehabilitation Hospital where she arrived at about 23:00 on 22 June. Because she arrived so late and out of core hours, she did not have the benefit of the full and usual assessments and she had also been waiting for the transfer for some significant time at the general hospital in its discharge lounge.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: –
1.  Jean had spent a lengthy period in the general hospital discharge lounge, during which time which she would not have had close checks and observations as compared to ward- based care. She did not arrive at the rehabilitation hospital until late at night and so did not have the usual core admission assessments. Such situations appear to me to have the potential to place patients such as Jean at significant risk. Given that there would usually be three parties involved in the transfer (the discharging hospital, the transporting ambulance service, and the discharge destination) there is opportunity for consideration of protocols to ensure such discharge arrangements are safe and appropriate.
 
2. Jean had signs of infection to the surgical site on arrival at the rehabilitation hospital and should have had more robust clinical review but confirmation of infection and referral back to the general hospital did not occur until her blood results were reviewed 3 days later. There had been opportunity to expedite the blood results. On the evidence at inquest there is reason to think that the rehabilitation staff were falsely reassured by a low NEWS score whereas there was suspected infection that could have been confirmed earlier.",On 05 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alice Jean FOX aged 90.

Eifion Wyn Huws was aged 63 at the time of his death on 10 June 2022. He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter’s home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter’s home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.      a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion’s GP had made a ‘very
urgent’ referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this ‘very urgent’ referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.
 
b. During the evidence it was accepted that ‘a’ above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board’s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.
 
An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion’s death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner.","On 21 June 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Eifion Wyn Huws (DOB 25/4/59) who died on 10 June 2022.

(2)   No attempt was made to interpret or tailor the risks inherent in the procedure in the light of his extensive medical history and co-morbidities.
(3)   The Consent Form did not refer to the risks of death, which befell him. He was thus not in a position to make a truly informed consent to undergo the sigmoidoscopy.
(4)   The Consent Form did not identify those clinicians involved in discussing the decision with him, save for who obtained his signature at a time when he was under the influence of morphine sedation.

She used an insulin pump to administer insulin and had done so since 2005.
 
ii) She had recently had a dental procedure and was also recently prescribed antibiotics for an infection. It was accepted by clinicians that this can cause a Type 1 diabetic to need more insulin than they would normally need.
 
iii) On the 3 December 2021, Sandra Diane Finches glucose levels start to rise. This is picked up by the pump that she used and this sounded regular alarms and gave correctional doses of insulin.
 
iv) On the 4 December 2021 Sandra Diane Finch called the West Midlands Ambulance Service and told them she was feeling more sleepy, her glucose was high and she had been vomiting. The categorisation of this call was category 3. This meant she was a medical emergency and required an ambulance. However, before an ambulance could be dispatched a clinical review Was required by the CV team.
 
v) The team was under staffed and had no time limit attached for an assessment. As such, an attempt for an assessment did not take place until
10  hours  later.  At 7:22 a call was made to Miss Finch. This was unanswered. The options available, at this stage, would have been to dispatch an ambulance, or to place the call back, back into the CV Teams work load. This was what happened.
 
vi)  At 12:47 on the 5 December 2023 the decision was made by the team to categorise the ambulance request as a category 2 and dispatch an ambulance. This arrived  at Sandra Diane Finches address at 13:08 and  she was found to have passed away as a result of ketoacidosis.
 
vii) Clinical opinion disagreed that category three was the correct categorisation. It should be have been a category 2. Evidence was heard that the pathway had to be followed rigidly so a computer could decide the category, but accepted that a clinician listening to the answers may well have made a different decision and given the call a category 2 marking.
 
The view of clinicians was that had the ambulance been despatched within the accepted time limit for a category 3 ambulance, Sandra Diane Finch would not have died when she did.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
 
1. That the pathways used by the service to categorise the level of ambulance and ridged and have no capacity for movement away from the path. This led to a type 1 diabetic patient, who was feeling sleepy and with deranged glucose levels, not being classed as a potentially serious situation requiring rapid intervention.

He had no previous history of depression or mental health problems. ","During the inquest I was referred by Mr Stevenson’s treating urologist to published literature relating to Ciprofloxacin and Quinolone antibiotics and a potential rare link to suicide behaviour in patients, although I found on the balance of probabilities that it remained unclear that he was suffering from this side effect, it remained possible for this to be the case.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
•  I heard evidence to suggest that the prescribing doctor did not reference this side effect at the time of issuing the prescription to Mr Stevenson, since it was not in accord with current advice.
•  I also heard evidence to suggest that prescribing doctors may not be fully aware of this rare side effect, and that patient’s suffering from depression may be more vulnerable to it.
I am therefore concerned that this potential risk has not been given sufficient emphasis and I would ask you to consider the appropriateness of reviewing the current guidelines as to the dispensation of the drug to patients by clinicians and increasing the awareness of the side effect in order to monitor and mitigate the risks.","On 22/06/22 I opened an inquest into the death of Robert Newton Stevenson who, at the date of his death was aged 63 years old.

In summary, Amelia’s mother had a routine pregnancy and was given a due date of 01 December 2020. She attended Peterborough City Hospital at around 1030 hours on 5 December 2020.
 
2. From very early on, the CTG trace was classified as suspicious on a number of occasions and on some occasions as pathological. Evidence and a report from HSIB confirms that assessment and decision making during this period was appropriate.
 
3. Due to a failure to progress in the second stage of labour and suspected fetal compromise at around 0240 hours, a decision was made for a Category 2 Caesarean section delivery.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN ARE:
1. While I heard evidence that there has been training for Midwives on how to take cord blood, and I was provided with a copy of a poster that was said to have been in use at the Trust for some time, in April 2023, over 2 years after this delivery, the Midwife gave evidence that she and her colleagues were of the opinion that it was appropriate to take a sample from anywhere in the cord, not just in the clamped area. The expert and the Trust’s own Head of Midwifery advised that this was not appropriate. It therefore does not appear that the learning has been passed on to all Trust Midwives and there is a risk that in future cases those treating the baby will be falsely reassured by normal cord pH results which may not be accurate.
 
While I read evidence of some training that had been provided in response to HSIB recommendations for further training on auscultation in addition to saturation monitoring and ECG monitoring during resuscitation, the independent expert also recommended training on UVC and IO access. I am also concerned that there does not appear to have been training in relation to the provision of blood transfusions in such cases to ensure that all potential reversible causes are treated before resuscitation stops. The Head of Midwifery who attended the inquest to advise on issues relating to the recommendations was not in a position to provide evidence on the neonatal position and I have been provided with no evidence by the Trust that these issues have been considered. I am concerned that they require further action.","On 14 October 2021 an investigation in to the death of Amelia Barbosa was commenced. Amelia died on 13 December 2020, aged 7 days.

He received a dose of intravenous antibiotics and intravenous fluids and was discharged from hospital with a course of oral antibiotics. Akash attended for a follow-up chest Xray on the 28 February 2022. This Xray showed progression in his left lung consolidation and showed a new consolidation in his right lung. The inquest heard that the primary diagnosis based on this Xray should have been tuberculosis. On the 4 March 2022, an emergency ambulance was called when Akash was found to be coughing and vomiting blood. Paramedics attended and provided emergency assistance. They could not however resuscitate Akash and his life was pronounced extinct by a paramedic. A post-mortem examination revealed a pulmonary abscess which was most likely to have been caused by tuberculosis. There is no evidence that any acts or omissions in the care provided to him, contributed to his death. The chest radiograph was not sent for analysis until 8 March 2022.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
The Xray on the 28 February 2022, which was carried out following treatment for pneumonia, showed an obvious progression in lung consolidation and was highly suggestive of tuberculosis (a new clinical diagnosis). Akash was not an in-patient in hospital at the time of the follow-up Xray. He had been discharged and was therefore not under the active management of a clinical team. The inquest heard that such significant, unexpected, and important changes should have been highlighted to the referring clinician. This was not done. There does not appear to be a process in place for an alert to be added to the normal communication method to ensure that such significant, unexpected, and important findings are acted upon in a timely manner.
 
The inquest also heard that the incidence of TB is rising in certain areas of the UK and that it is important that radiologists recognise TB changes and that these are duly highlighted to the referrer.","On the 30 May 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Akash Dinesh Bhudia, age 28 years.

At the time of his death Samuel was suffering from alcohol addiction and had a diagnosis of ADHD and social anxiety. Prior to his death Samuel had received treatment from the Community Drug and Alcohol Treatment (‘CDAT’) team and primary mental health services. Samuel was discharged from CDAT fifteen months prior to his death. CDAT had information on their system (including from their own risk assessment) to indicate that Samuel had been assessed as a significant risk of suicide. There was other valuable information about Samuel’s risk factors on the CDAT system. At the time when Samuel was under CDAT the GP had also referred Samuel to the community mental health team raising his concerns about Samuel’s risk of suicide. It is not clear is CDAT had access to this letter. When the primary mental health services consultant began treating Samuel for his ADHD – which continued up to Samuel’s death – he received a referral from CDAT but he did not have access to the detailed information on the CDAT electronic system. The consultant could not and did not see the CDAT risk assessment, the outcome and assessment from the individual CDAT sessions and other vital historical information of potential relevance to Samuel’s risk factors and triggers for suicide.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern.

The first MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows:
I am concerned that in cases where an individual is receiving treatment from alcohol and drug addiction services and treatment from the primary community mental health team that neither team is able to access the other teams records electronically. The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis – such as substance misuse and mental health – given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care-coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual.
 
I am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk that information of significance regarding a risk to life will be lost between agencies and not sufficiently understood between all those managing.",On 13th May 2019 an investigation was commenced into the death of Samuel Alexander Morgan who was found deceased in his parents’ house on the 9th May 2019 after having tied a ligature around his neck.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
This inquest highlighted the significant numbers of prisoners who enter the prison system with known or undiagnosed mental health issues. Whilst ACCT 6 requires multidisciplinary attendance at review meetings, this case highlighted the need for specific attendance of an RMN or other mental health expert at any review, (Mr Robinson had repeatedly self harmed prior to committing suicide but had presented without concern at each review which had been carried out without any input from the mental health team). The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending. This has enabled the prison to identify issues which may not be picked up by other professionals involved, to enable support to be put in place by way of separate care plans which has had a notable impact upon SASH in the prison.",On 05 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stuart Michael ROBINSON aged 20.

I was informed by [REDACTED] that as of January this year, there were 600 open cases of rape or serious sexual assault. I was told additionally that there are over 20 vacancies for DCs to progress these complaints. One consequence was that it was taking over a month to achieve best evidence through video interview or otherwise.

In December 2021, she was offered staged bilateral knee replacements. She was assessed by [REDACTED] as being at high risk of developing a DVT.   She had a nurse-led pre-op assessment on 26/1/22 when, I am told, a further risk assessment was not done, in accordance with policy at the time.   ","During the course of the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – I enclose the bundle of evidence.
At pp A32-A54, you will find what I am told is the Trust’s Guideline Summary for Thrombosis Prevention and Anticoagulation. At p42, following elective knee replacement, it is suggested clinicians may choose any one of
Aspirin [REDACTED] for 14 days
LMWH for 14 days and anti-embolism stockings 
Rivaroxaban [REDACTED] once daily for 14 days
 
As matters of fact, I am told Mrs Hancock was prescribed 14 days of aspirin and, in apparent error, one unidentified doctor also prescribed Dalteparin which was stopped after a single dose. It is of concern that the doctor cannot be identified and I have no record of the decision-making.
 
At C32, you will find the Trust’s full guidance for drug prophylaxis following elective knee replacement which is taken from its Thrombosis Prevention and Anticoagulation Policy v9.0 dated Feb 2022. It provides:
 
Low risk – Aspirin [REDACTED] daily for 14 days
High Risk – Rivaroxaban [REDACTED] daily for 14 days or
Dalteparin or Enoxaparin for 28 days plus stockings (until discharge.)
 
[REDACTED] had not seen the full guidance previously despite it having been published for over a year which, as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, is of concern in itself.
 
[REDACTED] further said that Mrs Hancock was high risk yet she appears to have been given prophylaxis for a low risk patient because the summary guidelines appear not to reflect accurately the full guidance.
 
[REDACTED], as I understood [REDACTED], said that it had been [REDACTED] practice to prescribe aspirin to all high-risk patients since (at least) February 2022. This raises the question of whether other patients have died from a PE or DVT because of wrongly prescribed prophylaxis that have not been reported to this Office. You will need to consider the position.
 
I have only considered the situation as it came before me, namely, for an elective knee replacement. As I understand the anticoagulation policy will have a much wider reach than that there is an obvious need to consider the implications across all the Trust’s services.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13/7/23.

Pain is a recognised complication of stenting in these circumstances. He was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital on 13th September 2021 following episodes of bleeding. A gastroscopy on 14th September 2021 confirmed that the bleeding was from the oesophagus – from an aorta/oesophageal fistula.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The inquest heard evidence that oesophageal strictures are a recognised complication of radiotherapy for oesophageal cancers. The implications of them are significant for patients as they can lead to aspiration and as well as significantly impact quality of life. At this time there is only very limited national guidance on how to best treat patients with strictures and limited evidence on which to develop best practice. The evidence given was that careful dilatation by an experienced practitioner was the best approach initially. However, dilatation particularly repeated dilatation carried risk of perforation and needed to be seen as something that could not be continued indefinitely. However, there was limited evidence on what the optimum number of dilatations were and/or when to stop and move to consider stenting.
 
The inquest heard that stenting of patients in these circumstances has a limited body of evidence regarding the risk. The inquest highlighted that perforation may be a risk in some cases where a stent is used and that needed to be factored into any decision to use a stent.",On 16th September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raymond Lee.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1.     The evidence heard during the course of the inquest highlighted an inconsistency between the literature provided by the manufacturer of sertraline (the patient information leaflet (‘PIL’)) and the British National Formulary (‘BNF’) produced by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (latest version: BNF 85, March 2023).
 
2.     The PIL contains a list of “uncommon” side effect of suicidal behaviour, which includes the following in bold: “Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during sertraline therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 2).”
 
3.     The BNF relating to Depression (3.4, p395) and the use of Antidepressant Drugs states under the heading “Suicidal depression and antidepressant therapy” (p397): “The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children young adults and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour and particularly suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.”
 
4.     The section of the BNF relating to SSRIs (p401) also identifies “suicidal behaviours”
as a potential uncommon side-effect.
 
5.     However, the section with respect to sertraline does not specifically identify suicidal tendencies at all, although it does identify “thinking abnormal” as an uncommon side effect (p.405).
 
6.     I am concerned that there is a risk that a medical practitioner consulting the BNF with a view to determining dosage and treatment with Sertraline will be unaware of the potential risk of the onset of suicidal behaviour and/or would not consider it necessary to discuss that risk with the patient. The evidence heard at the inquest suggested that it would not be appropriate or practical for GPs to consider PILs before prescribing.
 
On the other hand, the PIL and BNF are intended for different purposes. It may be that the evidence of risk of suicidal ideation associated with Sertraline specifically (as opposed to SSRIs) is so low that it need not be referred to in the BNF, notwithstanding its inclusion in the PIL. Nevertheless, this is a matter of concern that would in my view benefit from further consideration.",On 18 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joshua Fynn ASPREY aged 19. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 March 2023.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 30 June, 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:-
Ms Forte had for a number of years been seeing a private psychiatrist. Details of her consultations and treatments were not made readily available to those working in the NHS Trusts. It appears that there is no clear pathway for details of any private psychiatrist consultations to be shared with those in either the acute or mental health inpatient settings. The concerns are that any relevant history may be lost and details of any regular medication being prescribed may not, in a time of crisis, be immediately known.",On 21st February 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Caroline Victoria Forte aged 35 years.

In December 2020 on a diagnosis of depressive illness incorporating psychotic symptoms, Mr Charles was made subject to an order under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983.
 
On 10th April 2021 Mr Charles was found unresponsive, suspended [REDACTED]
 on the mental health ward.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.     A failure to adequately assess risk of harm – Poor record keeping and a failure to read electronic records meant that important information was not considered at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (“MD T”) ward round on 6th April 2021. The MDT arrived at a conclusion that Mr Charles’ risk of self-harm was “no risk”. A psychologist’s assessment on the clinical record that assessed Mr Charles risk of self-harm as high on 31/3/21 was neither read nor incorporated into the MDT discussion.
 
2.     A decision to reduce observation frequency made by the MDT on 6/4/21 was not supported by the Trust Policy guidance which indicated that enhanced observations were appropriate.
 
3.     A failure to ensure that a treatment plan was followed – observations between
16.00 and 17.00 on the day of Mr Charles’ death were suspended by the ward shift co-ordinator. The decision meant all patients subject to general observation on the ward were ignored.
 
4.     Failures to respond to an emergency adequately – The Trust described the emergency response as chaotic . Staff agreed that they “panicked ” and did not follow policy, specific issues include;
a.     A ward emergency bell was not sounded,
b.     An anti-barricade key was not used to open Mr Charles’ door, instead the door was forced open causing a risk of harm to Mr Charles .
c.     A ligature cutter could not be used promptly as it was secured in a box with a combination lock – staff did not know the combination,
d.     Duty doctors were not called promptly,
e.     Oxygen administration was delayed,
f.       An on-site defibrillator was not used by staff
g.     Staff could or would not provide a clear and relevant history to paramedics.
 
5.     The credibility of evidence provided by Trust staff.
a.     Two Trust witnesses declined to answer questions put to them regarding whether their observation records were truthful.
b. Observation records appeared to have been created utilising a “cut and paste” function.
c. Records often inaccurately recorded the prescribed frequency of observation.
d. Factually inaccurate entries were made in the record following Mr Charles’ death. On 11th April 2021 an entry stated that Mr Charles was, “Awake in his bedroom sitting on his bede (sic)” at 07.21. On 12th April two entries made at 9.48 and 11.40 recorded that Mr Charles’ was alive and well. Senior Trust witnesses characterised these entries as dishonest.
 
6.     Governance process failings.
a.     A datix incident report created on the evening of 10th April 2021 by a senior nurse and Modern Matron contained misleading information that suggested that emergency response policies were followed when in fact they were not.
b.     The Datix failed to mention that observations had been suspended by the shift coordinator, a fact that was understood at that time. This obvious and significant piece of information that should have been escalated through the Trust governance team for action.
C. The Trust 72 hour report was written by the Modern Matron and was signed-off by an integrated care director on 15th April 2021. This document also failed to identify or escalate the significant issue of the suspension of observation at 16.00 on 10th April 2021.
d. The Trust SI report presented to the inquest failed to address the poor risk assessment or inadequate datix & 72 hr reports.","On 11th April 2021 this Court commenced an investigation into the death of Winbourne Gregory Charles, aged 58.

At Inquest it was identified that not all actions arising have been fully completed and the dates by when actions ought to have been completed (according to the investigation report) not adhered to. For example, the investigation report was due to be shared with vascular services to share learning by June 2022 (once approved) and yet the Report was only shared with vascular services in January 2023.
 
The actions arising from the investigation report are not always realistic. For example, one action was to identify any gaps in knowledge with regards to assessment and management of vascular emergencies, including recording of limb colour, sensation and movement, by the end of June 2022, approximately 3-4 weeks after the final report.
 
I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations.
 
I remain significantly concerned that the strategic management of internal Health Board investigations is lacking leading to investigations that are too slow, actions are not always realistic and, as a result, identification of areas for learning and training are not understood quickly enough, such that deaths will occur or will continue to occur into the future unless rapid action is taken.",On 11 January 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Carolyn Nancy Price (DOB 3/6/1958) who died on 1 January 2021. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 April 2023. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 21 June 2023.

Although Mrs. Smith sustained no obvious physical injury, she complained of head pain the same evening and was taken by ambulance to the Leicester Royal Infirmary in the early hours of 16 March 2022, where she was diagnosed with spinal fractures. On a balance of probabilities, the injuries were caused by a high energy fall and in keeping with having fallen down the stairs. At the hospital Mrs. Smith was treated conservatively due to her age and dementia; she deteriorated over the following days and, after discussions with family members on 21 March 2022, she was placed on palliative care and died the following day.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
At the time of Mrs. Smith’s fall, there were 17 residents and 2 carers. One carer was attending a resident upstairs and the other carer was outside the care home accompanying another resident who wished to have a cigarette. This meant that no carer was in the lounge area monitoring the residents. Accordingly, when Mrs. Smith left the lounge area she was not monitored as required. If she had been monitored, it is understood that she would have been offered assistance and, on a balance of probabilities, the fall that led to her death would not have occurred.
 
It was understood that at the care home there were, and still is, a number of residents with challenging behaviour and care needs, and that for some activities of daily living 2 carers may be required. With only 2 carers on a shift, it is foreseeable that residents can and will be left unattended. It is also foreseeable that competing needs of the residents will mean that residents will be left unmonitored, and an unsafe environment created as occurred with Mrs. Smith. Accordingly, there remains a concern that the provider has not done everything possible to mitigate the risk of actual or potential harm including death.",On 31 March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Janet SMITH aged 81. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 April 2023. ,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.

• diabetes (type 2) diagnosed 1999
• chronic kidney disease, from 2012
• diverticular disease from 2012
• raised BMI, at times over 30,
• myasthenia gravis (MG), symptoms identified from around April 2020,
 
John was prescribed steroids from December 2020 for MG, escalating to the highest recommended dose of 100mg prednisolone, taken every other day. John received this high dose from 21 February 2021 until his death on 26 June 2021. That is with the exception of a period between 7 and 13 June 2021 following an inadvertent reduction in dosage to 25mg whilst an in-patient at RCHT. John was discharged on 15 June 2021 after this dosage error. I found that John was medically fit at the time of discharge and that the dosage error did not contribute to his cause of death.
 
John was re-admitted on 22 June with a history of vomiting and retching for 2 days before admission; I found on the evidence that this was the likely period when John suffered his perforated sigmoid colon. This was deemed inoperable. John did not respond to antibiotics and was discharged home on 25 June 2021 for palliative care. John died peacefully at home on 26 June 2021.
 
I found on the evidence of the histopathologist [REDACTED], that steroid therapy was contributory to John’s cause of death, alongside John’s other conditions. I found on the evidence that it was not possible to distinguish between the multiple conditions contributing to, and causative of, the perforated bowel.
 
[REDACTED] stated in evidence as follows:
 
…steroid therapy increases the risks of gastrointestinal complications including ulceration and perforation of the stomach, duodenum and the colon and these are recognised complications documented in the literature. The mechanism is unclear but steroids are thought to impair the mucosal barrier which enables bacteria to penetrate. Steroid induced colonic perforation is more likely to occur in patients with diverticular disease and the deceased was noted at autopsy to suffer from diverticular disease. It is speculated that in diverticular disease there is a localised concentration of bacteria.
Also, if the patient is treated by high dose steroids, the signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic complications may be masked by the anti-inflammatory effects of the drugs. This may potentially lead to delays in identification of the drug induced complications, so potentially resulting in the patient presenting with advanced complications such as viscus perforation.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Suicide 
Samuel’s mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death.
 
We believe that the following matters also possibly made more than minimal, trivial or negligible contributions to his death
 
a) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel’s dependency on alcohol and the possibility of a rehabilitative placement.
 
There were inadequate provisions for Samuel’s complex needs. In particular, it was noted that no alternative treatments were proactively pursued. The agencies identified Covid as an obstacle to justify their inadequate responses.
 
b) The failure to inadequately share risk information by Social Services and/or Mental Health Services with each other, and with the police.
 
A number of factors were noted in this regard:
 
•  Missing risk assessments were not completed consistently
 
•  The Grab Pack was not completed
 
•  iii) Samuel’s vulnerabilities and suicide notes were not adequately communicated to the police by Social Services","During the course of the investigation, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN (some of which overlap) are as follows:
 
(1)   Samuel’s case should be a stimulus for some level of Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service reflection on how different Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams are organised and work together.
 
(2)   The delayed response of the Adult Complex Additions Service to referral and issues related to provision of care to adolescents presenting with mental health vulnerabilities and substance use difficulties.
 
(3)   The lack of a complex service providing, to adolescents, treatment for both substance misuse and mental health issues models, in terms of willingness to engage, being problematic for some young people.
 
(4)   The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel’s dependency on alcohol and the provision of a rehabilitative placement.

She had a period of care at KMH CCU, but had to be transferred to Burton Hospital on 22.3.22 as KMH CCU was at operational capacity. She continued to make good progress on the CCU at Burton Hospital, but there were continuing issues of difficult airway management.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows 
 ·       There is limited evidence to date for the introduction and continuing use of comprehensive airway strategies, with structured planning and preparation, when a difficult airway is anticipated. There should be airway plans A, B, and C recorded, shared, and the equipment and skills to carry them out must be available
·       There is limited evidence to date for the universal use of the NAP4 algorithms and checklists, which should be available on the difficult airway trolley, and be familiar to all ICU nursing and medical staff, and to the wider anaesthetic team
 
·       There is limited evidence to date, for the robust daily checking of all necessary equipment on the difficult airway trolley, to ensure immediate replacement of all key equipment if it is broken or misplaced
 
·       The Mortality Review policy was not followed, leading to a significant delay in completing the serious incident review, delaying Trust learning, and delaying the family’s understanding of the circumstances of Jodie’s death. There is limited evidence of progress in implementing the national Patient Safety Incident Response Framework at the Trust

He had had several other spinal operations before then. He developed infection and abscesses, and the evidence showed that the most likely origin of that infection was the surgery that he had in January. He died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital on the 3rd March 2022.
 
As part of the investigation, I reviewed the medical records. These included medical records from the time of his surgery at Spire Hospital in Portsmouth, but also included outpatient appointments (as a private patient) with [REDACTED] on (inter alia) 29th December 2021 (by telephone), 26th January 2022, and 23rd February 2022.
 
My investigation revealed that [REDACTED] made no formal medical records of the outpatient appointments. It is right to point out that [REDACTED] letters dictated and typed up by his secretary (to the patient and his GP), and some of this correspondence is relatively detailed. It was advanced on his behalf that this correspondence effectively represents a medical record and it is entirely appropriate to make ‘records’ in this way.
 
I did not accept that this correspondence is as full as a medical record would be. Much of the correspondence relates predominantly to plans and proposed courses of action, rather than a record of the patient’s condition at that time.
 
In questioning, [REDACTED] accepted that much of the further information which he gave at the inquest (and referred to in a witness statement) is not recorded anywhere other than his own personal memory.
 
Even leaving aside GMC requirements in relation to record-keeping, it is plainly the case that records are important for patient safety, and storing information about a patient in an individual doctor’s memory is clearly unacceptable. Leaving aside the issue of protection for the clinician, this approach carries a risk for patients.
 
I was clear at the inquest that I had no reason to disbelieve the additional evidence which [REDACTED] brought to the inquest – both in his oral evidence in court and in his witness statement – but I am concerned about the risks of this continued approach for other patients. In questioning, [REDACTED] clarified that his intention is to continue practising in this way.","The issue about which I have concern is clear.
 
[REDACTED] should review his record-keeping approach, perhaps with the benefit of legal advice and reference to GMC guidance. An approach of ‘storing’ information in an individual clinician’s memory carries a risk (including a risk of death) for future patients.","I conducted an inquest into the death of Peter William Frederick Lawrence, which concluded on 15th March 2023.

When her baby was 11 months old she returned to work, but was signed off sick suffering from anxiety and depression. On the evening of the 14th March 2022 she was taken by her family to Kingston Hospital and assessed by the liaison psychiatric team. She expressed suicidal thoughts and plans [REDACTED].
 
She was diagnosed with postpartum depression. She was advised to become an informal patient in the NHS but there was no bed available so she would have had to wait in the hospital until a bed could be found. She decided to seek a private admission the following day.
 
On the 15th March 2022 she sought treatment at the Priory Hospital, Woking. She had a preadmission assessment with [REDACTED] a consultant psychiatrist who accepted her as a patient. She told him that she had a suicide plan but did not provide details of what it was. He assessed her as a high risk of suicide and set observations at four times an hour. She was allocated a Key Worker who was not due to be in the hospital until 22nd March 2022, and a Co-worker, who had a one-to-one with her on 19th March 2022. Her overall mental health appeared to have improved when she was reviewed by [REDACTED] on March 18th 2022. The observation level
was reduced to twice an hour on the 16th March 2022, and then further to
once an hour on the morning of March 21st 2022, on each occasion without a risk assessment being performed as specified in the Priory policy.
 
Later on the morning of the 21st March 2022 Miss Henderson made comments during a therapy session which indicated that her mental health was deteriorating. The therapists recorded what she had said in her notes, but the concerns were not considered to be serious enough to be escalated to the nursing team. Evidence presented to the inquest suggests that Amy’s observations should have been increased at this stage. Amy was not reviewed by the nursing team when the therapists’ notes were uploaded onto the system at 16.06 on 21st March 2022. The information was not reviewed and therefore not acted upon.
 
Miss Henderson was last seen in person at 18.02 in the dining room. At
18.12. she entered the downstairs disabled toilet. The disabled toilet had been identified in risk assessments as a high-risk area but it was not locked. She wrote a farewell note to her parents at 18.14. She was found in the disabled toilet on the ground floor at 20.01. She had taken her own life by suspension, [REDACTED].","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. Inmy opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1.     The information that Miss Henderson had practised tying a ligature was divulged by her at Kingston Hospital but not repeated on admission to the Priory Woking. The evidence given at the inquest was that there is no quick method to obtain NHS records on admission to a private hospital. A request could have been made but the records would have taken over a week to be released. The records were not sought. An ability to obtain the NHS records quickly would have been of assistance to the Priory clinicians.
 
The Priory Woking has a policy in relation to the removal of banned and restricted items but there was a lack of clarity and confusion among the clinicians as to who was responsible for ensuring that such items are identified and removed from the patient at admission.",An inquest into the death of Miss Amy Henderson was opened on the 26th April 2022 and resumed with a jury on the 6th February 2023.

27/04/2023,20/04/2023,2023-0128,Joseph Maunick,Peter Taheri,Suffolk,Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths,Department of Health and Social Care | NHS England,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/joseph-maunick-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Joseph-Maunick-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0128_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-0128-Response-from-NHS-England.pdf,"Joseph Willy Maunick (Will) was an intelligent man, gifted with communication skills, who worked as a teacher and spoke multiple languages. In his later years he developed cognitive impairment, which in turn led to him being at very high risk of falls. This risk, in relation to which he needed constant supervision, was known to those caring for him and to those responsible for looking after him when he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was admitted to the hospital Emergency Department not because he himself was experiencing a medical emergency, but as a last resort after exhaustive efforts to explore all options before Will was admitted to hospital: it proved not to be possible to find suitable alternative care for him in residential care placements while his wife, and main carer, underwent unplanned emergency major surgery.
 
The inquest heard evidence that, prior to his admission to hospital, at least eight social care providers were contacted plus further residential homes, but none of them could provide emergency care for Will. The inquest heard undisputed evidence that this was an instance of a national care shortage.
 
The inquest heard evidence that in an Emergency Department where many patients are suffering medical emergencies constant one-to-one supervision will not always be possible. I found as a fact that it was not possible on this occasion and that Will’s fall in the Emergency Department took place when the nursing assistant who was trying to maintain constant one-to-one supervision of Will insofar as possible had their attention momentarily diverted to another patient experiencing a medical emergency. I judged that it would not be just to describe this as a failure on the part of the nursing assistant or the Emergency Department staff.
 
The reason why it was not an individual failure included that the inquest heard evidence that the hospital, and in particular the Emergency Department, was experiencing significant pressures associated with high demand and an internal critical incident had been declared. There was a high demand for beds within the hospital without the availability of beds to meet the demand. This included the facts that there were, at the time of Will’s arrival in the Emergency Department, 50 patients in the Emergency Department, of whom 32 were waiting for bed placement. Moreover, staffing was at a ‘black status’ (the worst level) across the hospital, with a deficiency of staff of around 60 nurses and nursing assistants.
 
I found as a fact that those severe pressures – the high demand levels and the deficiency of staff and scarcity of resource – contributed to the death. Firstly, if it had been possible to care for and supervise Will on a constant basis as he needed, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.
 
Secondly, on the balance of probabilities, the scarcity of resource relative to demand contributed to Will not being transferred to a ward – or other more appropriate environment – sooner.
 
Apart from the inherent particular difficulties in providing constant supervision in an Emergency Department referred to above, the inquest also received undisputed evidence that the environment of a busy, noisy Emergency Department, with lights on at all hours of the day and night would be overly stimulating and not the most suitable environment for someone with cognitive impairment who was experiencing confusion and agitation. I found that such an environment probably contributed to Will’s inclination to wander and so to his fall.
 
If it had been possible to transfer Will to a more suitable environment sooner, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.
 
I found as a fact that, on the balance of probabilities, the lack of availability of more appropriate care contributed to the death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1)  A national care shortage contributed to a situation where a gentleman who was not experiencing a medical emergency, but who required constant supervision for his own safety in view of his cognitive impairment and very high falls risk, could not be cared for anywhere other than in a hospital Emergency Department. If there is not sufficient provision of care, including residential care placements, such that those in similar need do not receive suitable care, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths will occur or continue to exist in the future, when they are placed in an environment that is not realistically able to provide the constant supervision needed, as occurred in this case.
 
The severe pressures on the hospital, including the Emergency Department, were such that they were experiencing scarcity of resource relative to demand and a severe deficiency of staff. In these circumstances, it was both not possible to provide the care and supervision that Will needed in the Emergency Department, and the scarcity of resource contributed to Will not being transferred sooner to a ward or other more appropriate environment, where Will could receive the constant supervision that would probably have prevented the fall that led to his death. The evidence was that the scarcity of resource experienced was a challenge on the national level, rather than just a particular local issue. If hospitals, including Emergency Departments, do not receive sufficient resource, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths, due to an inability to provide the required care and / or prompt transfer to an available ward bed or appropriate alternative place, will occur or continue to exist in the future.",On 18th March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Joseph Willy Maunick.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th April 2023. The narrative conclusion of the inquest was that:   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe each of you and / or your organisations have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15 June 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

27/04/2023,20/04/2023,2023-0127,Chester Mossop,Kirsty Gomersal,Cumbria,Child Death (from 2015),Office for Product Safety and Standards,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/chester-mossop-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Chester-Mossop-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0127_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-0127-Response-from-NHS-England.pdf,"Chester was a healthy and well looked after 9 months’ old baby. He was usually fit and well. However, on 29 May 2022, he had a mild viral infection (which was confirmed at post-mortem).
 
Chester was placed in a bath seat and given a bath in suitably warm water. The water level was higher than advised – so that Chester did not get chilled.
 
After about 20 minutes of bath time, Chester was left alone in his bath seat whilst a plug- in diffuser (to help his cold) was prepared in his bedroom. It was believed that the bath seat was safe and secure to hold him in place.
 
After a few minutes, Chester was found face down in the bath. The bath seat had become unfixed. There were no sounds that Chester was in distress or difficulty. He was immediately removed from the bath and given immediate CPR by a trained adult.
Emergency services were quickly on scene and CPR was continued by police, paramedics and clinicians. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved.
 
Chester was flown by air ambulance to the Great North Children’s Hospital at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. However, an MRI scan undertaken on 2 June 2022 showed that Chester had an extensive severe brain injury consistent with severe global hypoxic ischaemia caused by drowning. It was considered that Chester was unlikely to survive and further intensive care treatment was not in his best interest.
 
Intensive care support was withdrawn on 3 June 2022 and Chester died peacefully in his mother’s arms at 18:05.
 
I received a statement from RoSPA (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) setting out that:
 
·       Baby bath seats are unstable and prone to toppling over leaving the baby trapped in the water.
·       Bath seats may give parents and carers a false sense of security that baby is safer in a bath seat and can be left alone (despite warnings that this should not happen).
·       There can be a misconception that a baby bath seat is a safety product – this is not the case.
·       Under no circumstances should parents regard bath seats as a safety aid and leave a child out of arms reach.
·       RoSPA is aware of incidents where parents have been in the room, but away from the baby, with tragic results.
·       RoSPA is aware of a number of drownings of young children in the bath where a baby bath seat has been used.
·       There may be some bath seats that are less stable than others or that have inadequate methods to hold them in place.","The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
I am aware of similar tragic deaths to Chester’s and inquests held by my fellow Coroners. RoSPA is also aware of fatal and non-fatal incidents.
 
The use of bath seats is of concern to RoSPA.
 
Whilst I am aware of the regional Bath Safety Advice (set out above), I am not aware that similar advice has been distributed on a national level to healthcare professionals and to parents / carers. I am not aware whether parents / carers are provided with advice about the safe use of bath seats as part of e.g. health visits.
 
I am concerned that bath seats may given parents a false sense of security that their child is safe. Bath seats are not safety devices.",Chester Alan Stanley MOSSOP died on 3 June 2022 following an incident at his home address on 29 May 2022. Baby Chester’s death was reported to HM Coroner for Cumbria on 6 June 2022 and his death formally transferred from HM Coroner Newcastle.

She had been admitted unwell on 11th January 2022 after falling and breaking her arm. She suffered myocardial ischaemia and injury on the night of 13th /14th January which was not treated or managed in any way at all. She was not seen by a doctor again until she suffered a cardiac arrest on 18th January 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
On 13th January, at 23.15hrs a doctor reviewed Mrs Hutchins because she was complaining of being short of breath. She was alert but appeared to be very breathless, she was speaking with some difficulty. Mrs.Hutchins reported a one-day history of being short of breath with a productive cough and intermittent chest tightness. She was also nauseous. He sought advice from an SHO and documented the plan that she was for an ECG, blood test including a troponin, CRP and oxygen.
 
The ward cover SHO for Medicine, said that he was called initially for advice on the blood tests he said in evidence that he considered a heart attack and pulmonary embolism so said Troponin and D-Dimer. He sought advice from the Registrar who said that the ECG trace was not normal.
 
The Registrar said that at the time she had raised CPR and that she had a productive cough and he considered that this was a pneumonia. He said that he considered Troponin but thought that it would not be a useful test in the circumstances. His plan at this time was to give antibiotics, IV fluids, to repeat her heart trace in half an hour and to increase her observations to 1 hourly.
 
It is known that the Troponin result was returned at 01.35hrs on 14th January and that it was raised at 358.
 
The SHO saw Mrs Hutchins at 04.57 that morning, he had noted the raised Troponin, he made a plan for the day team to review her and for bloods to be done to include a serial Troponin level. He also recalls that he gave a handover and spoke to the nurses. He said he expected her to be reviewed.

By March 2022, Mr Mason was becoming more frail and, owing to mobility issues, was suffering from recurrent falls. Mr Mason fell in his bedroom on the evening of 5 March 2022. An ambulance was called but it took a number of hours until paramedics arrived and transported Mr Mason to hospital. Once there, Mr Mason was diagnosed with a fractured hip, as a result of the trauma suffered when he fell.","During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (numbered separately in respect of each organisation, who are required to respond to each of the numbered paragraphs relating to them):
 
Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust (WAHT)
1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing care to Mr Mason (in both the emergency department and the surgical trauma department) appreciated that, as someone who had Addison’s disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.
 
2)       The relevant internal Trust guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure-based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules, which are on the same page as advice to patients and families for long-term condition management) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.
 
3)       Evidence heard at the inquest (relating to the trauma/surgical department at WAHT) suggested that it is likely that many clinicians (including at consultant level) do not have a well-developed understanding of adrenal insufficiency and the crucial importance of administering replacement steroid therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of suffering an adrenal crisis.
 
4)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that no prompts exist on emergency department/clerking documentation at WAHT for clinicians to check whether a patient suffers
from adrenal insufficiency.  Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included.
 
West Midlands Ambulance Service University NHS Foundation Trust (WMAS)
1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing pre-hospital care to Mr Mason appreciated that, as someone who had Addison’s disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.
 
2)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical steroid treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. Currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not being considered by call-handlers at WMAS.
 
3)       The Serious Incident investigation report disclosed by WMAS did not make any recommendations in respect of improving clinicians’ knowledge of adrenal insufficiency and the importance of considering administering replacement steroid therapy.
 
4)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the investigation lead at WMAS had not been shown the inquest disclosure bundle, which had been disclosed to the legal department at WMAS a number of months prior to the inquest. This bundle contained relevant evidence from a different internal investigation (by WAHT), suggesting that the likely cause of Mr Mason’s deterioration and death was an acute adrenal crisis and not, as had been considered when a coronial referral had initially been made, hyperkalaemia and rhabdomyolysis (following a fall and long lie). This lack of internal co-ordination within WMAS prevented full internal investigation and learning in respect of the care given to Mr Mason by WMAS. The legal department of WMAS did not attend the inquest (it was their right not to) nor were WMAS legally represented by an external solicitor or barrister (it was their right not to be). Greater engagement and participation in the coronial investigation and inquest process would improve the Trust’s ability to learn from patient-safety incidents and enable the legal, governance and safety departments to better co-ordinate such investigations.
 
Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE)
1) The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) places very little emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis, owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the ‘administer hydrocortisone’ box) is itself a sub-section of an ‘emergencies in adults and children’ box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are ‘unwell’ require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis – it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered ‘unwell’ in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro- intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.
 
2) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical medical treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. The pathway and programmed- logarithm should be looked at, as currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not able to be considered by ambulance service control centres.
 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
1) The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. It is my understanding that a new guideline in respect of managing the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is currently being developed by NICE. Consideration of these matters should be included as part of guideline development.
 
Society for Endocrinology (Clinical Committee)
1)       The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. The clinical committee of the Society for Endocrinology has previously been involved in providing guidance in respect of managing patients with adrenal insufficiency. The Society’s input going forward is important in respect of considering any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.
 
2)       The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) place very
little emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the ‘administer hydrocortisone’ box) is itself a sub-section of an ‘emergencies in adults and children’ box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are ‘unwell’ require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis – it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that some of the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered ‘unwell’ in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.  The Society’s input going forward is important in respect of considering  any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.
 
NHS England
1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical medical treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival).

2)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that no prompts exist on emergency department/clerking documentation at WAHT for clinicians to check whether a patient suffers from adrenal insufficiency. Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included. It is not clear what follow-up action is taken by NHS England in relation to monitoring of compliance by NHS Trusts following National Patient Safety Alerts being issued.","On 13 March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of David Ernest Mason.

However, in the final month of his life, Patrick experienced a severe emotional deterioration. He engaged in repeated episodes of serious self-harm including cutting his arms, medication overdose and uncharacteristic excessive alcohol misuse. At one point, he briefly went missing when he travelled to Yorkshire – where he also self-harmed.
 
On 9 occasions during that final month, Patrick attended various hospital accident and emergency departments (in different NHS Trust areas), following incidents of self-harm.

On the 9th March 2022, Natalie was shopping on her own in a supermarket and was queued at the tills to pay for her groceries. Whilst she was waiting to be served, another shopper on a mobility scooter has joined the queue and was waiting, stationary.
 
Without warning the mobility scooter accelerated forward, ploughing into Natalie with some force and knocking her over. The forward propulsion of the mobility scooter was a conscious act of the driver/rider rather than an unforeseen mechanical or electrical fault.
 
On becoming aware of the injury caused to Natalie, the mobility scooter driver flees the scene and has not been identified or heard from since.
 
An ambulance was called but declined to attend and so staff from the supermarket transport Natalie to Musgrove Park Hospital where, on admission, it is discovered that she has sustained a fractured hummerus. Whilst she was medically fit for discharge throughout the duration of her stay in hospital, she required physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessments as part of her discharge planning. Natalie was ultimately discharged from hospital on the 9th April 2022 with a package of care in place.
 
Natalie suffered from immobility as a result of the injury, as well as severe pain.
 
She was re-admitted back into hospital on the 13th April 2022 when she was diagnosed with severe sepsis and an acute kidney injury due to a lower respiratory tract infection which had arisen solely as a consequence of the injuries she had sustained, and the resultant immobility, following a fall. Natalie died on the same day.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

1. No restrictions on those who are able to operate them; i.e. there are no requirements on the drivers to have vision to a certain standard; to evidence cognitive ability and competence to a standard to be able to understand the controls of the vehicle and how to operate them safely; to be within the acceptable drink drive limit of 80mg/100ml and/or not under the influence of any other substance.","On the 16th April 2022 the then-Senior Coroner, Mr Tony Williams, commenced an investigation into the death of Natalie Ann Young, aged 92 (“Natalie”).   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 05th April 2023.

In Queen’s Hospital, he was diagnosed as suffering from an undisplaced fracture of the pelvis. A decision was taken to treat Mr. Stiff conservatively. Even though there was no surgical intervention, he was admitted under the care of the orthopaedic team. The orthopaedic team are not specialists in controlling medical problems associated with fractures. During the course of the admission, Mr. Stiff’s appetite was much reduced. He was not offered any nutritional supplements. On the 15 November 2022 he had reduced oxygen saturations and the medical team became involved in his care. He was diagnosed as suffering from a chest infection. He was treated with supplemental oxygen; intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics. Sadly, Mr. Stiff did not recover and he passed away at Queen’s Hospital on the 16 November 2022. It is likely that the fall and fractured pelvis on the 10 November 2022 caused a decline in health and mobility which would have contributed to the development of the fatal pneumonia.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The Inquest heard evidence from an orthopaedic surgeon that patients such as Mr Stiff, who suffer hip and pelvic fractures and who have a number of additional age-related co-morbidities, would be best cared for by ortho- geriatricians. The inquest heard that this matter has been raised by the orthopaedic team on multiple occasions, but the orthogeriatric provision has not been increased.
 
The Inquest also heard that the lack of orthogeriatric provision is a national issue of concern within the NHS.
 
Orthopaedic trauma in elderly patients often exacerbates underlying medical conditions. Orthogeriatric trained staff would be better trained to recognise and treat medical co-morbidities. It is therefore considered that improved access to orthogeriatric care for this patient cohort could prevent future untimely deaths.",On 1 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of John Edward Stiff. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 5 April 2023.

She was 17 at the time of her death. The key facts in this case are as follows:
·       Alexandra had no significant past medical history.
·       She underwent an uneventful tonsillectomy on 22nd May 2021.
·       After returning home, she suffered post-operative bleeding and required further surgery.
·       The second operation was carried out on 30th May.
·       When the anaesthetic was administered on 30th May, Alexandra deteriorated suddenly and suffered a cardiac arrest.
·       A large number of clinicians were involved in trying to assist Alexandra, but tragically, she died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 31st May 2021.
·       There are no concerns about her clinical management.
The most likely cause of her sudden deterioration was an anaphylactic reaction to Rocuronium, a drug which she had not had before.","Background
This is not new territory. Several coroners have raised concerns similar to mine. Those listed below are simply the cases where coroners have sent Regulation 28 reports. There may well be others.
 
Previous cases include :
 
1.    In the case of Shante Turay-Thomas (who I believe was 18 at the time of her death), the Senior Coroner for Inner North London stated:
 
“The issues within this Prevention of Future Deaths report are predominantly national issues, but I heard at inquest that there is no person with named accountability for allergy services and allergy provision at NHS England, or the Department of Health as a whole.”","I conducted an inquest into the death of Alexandra Briess, which concluded on 15th December 2022. I recorded a Narrative Conclusion as follows:
 
Alexandra Briess underwent an uneventful tonsillectomy on 22nd May 2021. She suffered post-operative bleeding, and required further surgery. This was carried out on 30th May. During anaesthesia, Alexandra suffered a sudden deterioration and cardiac arrest. Despite extensive resuscitation efforts, she died at Royal Berkshire Hospital, London Road, Reading on 31st May 2021. Subsequent investigations have revealed that the most likely cause of her sudden deterioration was an anaphylactic reaction to Rocuronium. This was a drug she had not had before, and her reaction to it was unpredictable. Alexandra was a bright and well loved young woman, who had planned to study medicine herself.
 
Her cause of death was:
I a Anaphylaxis due to Rocuronium used during anaesthesia I b Surgery to repair post operative bleeding 30th May 2021 I c Tonsillectomy 22nd May 2021
 
This Regulation 28 Report has been deliberately delayed, to allow for careful consideration of guidance to pathologists, police and coroners, and in order to ensure the report is addressed to the correct recipients.

The family member called the emergency services and ambulance service personnel attended. The first response paramedic tried to elicit the history, but was unable to determine from Mrs Robinson what medication had been taken. There was a delay in conveying Mrs Robinson to hospital, in the order of around 50 minutes, but there is no evidence that this delay contributed to her death. Mrs Robinson was taken to Queen’s Hospital where a diagnosis of mixed drug toxicity, on the background of severe co-morbidities, was made. She was provided with intensive care. Sadly she did not recover and she passed away at Queen’s Hospital on the 8 May 2022. By way of background, Mrs Robinson had taken an overdose in March 2022 and had received care from the mental health home treatment team. On the 25 April 2022 she was discharged back to the care of the general practitioner. She was not assessed by a doctor in the home treatment team before her discharge and she did not receive a comprehensive risk assessment in the days leading up to her discharge. Whilst such assessments and reviews should have taken place, it is not possible to conclude that they would have prevented her death. It is noted that there were no documented concerns about her mental health between the 26 April and the 6 May 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She had consumed alcohol and was in an area of Hull known for its night time economy. She became separated from her friends and after looking in one location crossed a road. She misjudged the crossing and despite seeing the vehicle still attempted to cross the road. When struck by the car she landed on her head causing catastrophic injuries. Police witnessed the incident and were immediately on scene.
Throughout the advanced life support she remained in cardiac arrest, without a pulse or signs of breathing. She was conveyed to Hull Royal Infirmary where CPR was ceased and she was declared dead.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) On a Friday and Saturday night the Lowgate area of Hull city is exceptionally busy with people enjoying the night time economy. As such many are in drink. The area of Lowgate is open to traffic, it is also the location of a taxi rank. There is only one crossing facility (aside from at either end of the road), the road narrows significantly at one end.
 
(2) Police raised concerns as follows:
–          The road remaining open during a Friday and Saturday night.
–          The number of pedestrians using the area.
–          Many people in drink in the area having to cross the road.
–          The road is a 30 mph.
–          Lights of vehicles are distracting
–          The location of the taxi rank, pedestrians having to navigate around the parked taxis, some with lights on, to enter the road. Taxis do 3 point turns in the road and any vehicle doing this is a danger to pedestrians.
 
(3) Evidence was heard one doorman working in the area who stated “Having worked at the same location for some time, the area where the bars are on Lowgate is an accident waiting to happen. Members of the public are leaving the bars in a drunken state and they just wander into the road to cross, many of them not even looking for traffic on the road. Some vehicles travel down Lowgate far too fast given the evening activity” and another doorman stated “the road and both the footpaths at the location of the collision occurred on Lowgate are both very narrow. There is also a taxi rank outside O’Leary’s which doesn’t help as taxis were parked there at the time of the collision. I have seen numerous near misses over the years I have worked in the area. It is no exaggeration to say that there are between six to twelve incidents each night between cars and pedestrians, one thing which does not help and is also dangerous are taxis which do U turns in the road once they have collected their fare”.
 
(4) The police had previously made recommendations and further felt that closing Lowgate to all through traffic on a Friday and Saturday evening, making Lowgate a total no stopping zone on an evening between certain hours, moving the location of a taxi rank onto nearby Alfred Gelder Street.
 
(5) I note the statement from the local authority listed
– They have erected 2 speed signs since the incident. Bearing in mind that this incident occurred with a vehicle travelling well within the limits, traffic is the concern not limited to the speed of vehicles.
– The council was looking at developing a document that reviewed speed limits for the whole of the city centre. Lowgate has a special reason for being an area of concern and should be looked at as a priority and not in conjunction with all other city centre streets.
– That engagement with the councils public transport department has commenced with the intention to relocate the taxi rank to Alfred Gelder street “but this requires consultation with the Hackney Carriage Association”. No indication was given regarding what was being done to facilitate this.
– The council say that there are no resources to manage the road closure, despite acknowledging it is their responsibility. The fact the road is open at this time is a danger and I am concerned given the comments of the doormen that the danger is being underestimated.
– Crossing facilities had been looked at but could not be positioned within a suitable distance.
 
(6)  I am concerned that inappropriate weight has been given to the danger arising in this area and that without appropriate action further incidents will occur.","On 2nd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rebecca Lisa KIRBY, aged 31 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29th March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Incident. 
  
Box 3 of the record of inquest read:   
On the evening of 27th August 2021 Rebecca Lisa KIRBY was out socialising. She misjudged the traffic on Lowgate, Hull and ran in to the path of an oncoming vehicle. The vehicle was travelling at 23 miles per hour however the way Ms Kirby landed resulted in significant head injuries, causing her to become immediate unresponsive. Despite many people coming to her aid to offer advanced life support, she remained in cardiac arrest. She was transported to Hull Royal Infirmary where she was declared deceased.   ",,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 24th May 2023.

She had recently been diagnosed with hypertension which was being treated with atenolol. She was also taking hormone replacement therapy. 
ii.) For the previous 5 years she had been using a Decathlon Easybreath full face snorkel mask when on holiday. 
iii.) On the 13th January 2020 she was snorkelling using the full face mask when she expressed concerns and was accompanied back to the beach. She collapsed and died. 
iv.) Expert evidence at the inquest identified immersion pulmonary oedema as the cause of the death. This is caused by the build-up of fluid in the lungs as a result of an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure caused by water pressure when the chest is submerged. This is exacerbated by hypertension and hormone replacement therapy. Negative pressure in the lungs causes fluid from the blood vessels to be drawn into the lungs. 
v.) The use of a full face snorkel mask contributed to the death in two ways: 
a.) because negative pressure in the lungs is increased as a result of the increased effort of breathing caused by inhalation through the snorkel tube and mask, and 
b.) because respiratory effort is increased by the inhalation of elevated carbon dioxide levels caused by inhaling air drawn through a dead space in the mask.
Both exacerbate the negative pressure in the lungs and increase the effects of immersion pulmonary oedema.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Awareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession:
i.) Concerns were raised by the medical witnesses that there is very little awareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession and that it is not addressed in medical training, as a consequence, it can be missed by those treating the condition and is often mistaken for drowning.
 
The Full Face Mask
 
ii.) At the time that the Easybreath full face snorkel mask was developed by Decathlon there were no United Kingdom or European Standards which were applicable to a full face snorkelling mask.
iii.) In the course of its development, Decathlon commissioned a number of tests to be undertaken on it, but it was accepted in evidence that the tests undertaken did not replicate the conditions of the use of the mask by the general public.
iv.) Decathlon have sold over 16 million of the masks. Other such masks are also on the market.
v.) The Decathlon usage instructions for the full face mask, contained in small print, have been amended over time. From the 17th August 2015 the instructions included a warning that you must make sure that you are in good physical condition before snorkelling and that the mask is not suitable for swimming.
vi.) Further tests were undertaken and an Ergomedical report considered the issue of whether use of the mask and inhalation through the mask’s dead space gave rise to excess carbon dioxide inhalation. The report concluded “we strongly recommend to advise against wearing Easybreath masks to people who suffer from underlying cardio-respiratory conditions.”
vii.) As a result, Decathlon amended their instructions for use to include that the mask should not be used if the user has unstable cardio-respiratory pathologies, that the mask is to be used under conditions of submaximal exercise (mild to moderate) and that it is not suitable for active swimming.
viii.) Development of a United Kingdom standard in relation to this type of mask is now being put in train but has not yet begun and is likely to take some time.
ix.) Decathlon have recently updated their website in the United Kingdom to include the following, “It is not recommended to use this product if you have any ongoing respiratory or cardiovascular issues including but not limited to chest infection, asthma, high/raised blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease or angina etc. If you have any doubts or questions relating to this please check with your medical practitioner.” The same additional wording is being translated and added to all websites of the company.
x.) The packaging of the mask has been revised to show a pictogram to warn against use of the mask by those with heart or other cardiovascular conditions.
xi.) The concern is that many million of the full face masks have been sold and the safety concerns about their use by those with ongoing cardiovascular and respiratory issues has not been widely publicised or brought to the attention of those who already own the masks. Those purchased before 2017 had no warning is relation to these matters and the warning included in the instructions from 2017 inwards was not prominent nor sufficient to alert prospective purchasers to the hazards of use which have now been identified.",Following an investigation opened on the 2nd March 2020 and an inquest opened on the 5th March 2020 the inquest was concluded on the 20th December 2022.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9th May 2023.

He was admitted to St Peters Hospital, Chertsey (SPH) for further assessment and discharged later that day having fully recovered.
 
2. Louis remained well until the morning of 11th February 2021 when he had a second self-limiting seizure. He was again taken to St Peters Hospital, Chertsey for observation and discharged later that day after being reviewed by a consultant paediatrician.
 
3. However, shortly after discharge, Louis had a further seizure in the early evening 17.00 hours of 11th February 2021. The emergency services attended and after a period of observation, Louis remained at home.
 
4. On 1st May 2021 Louis attended the Emergency Department at St Peters Hospital accompanied by his father over concerns of a 1 day history of being lethargic, clingy and wobbly on his feet following a minor head injury 5 days prior. Louis was discharged after observations were normal and no abnormalities, including neurological deficits, were found.","1. Management and investigation of Febrile Seizures
Evidence was heard that a number of children who have ‘febrile’ seizures subsequently die from ‘sudden unexpected death in childhood’. Evidence was provided that there should be greater emphasis on medical education, research and public information for sudden unexpected deaths associated with febrile seizures. Further evidence was heard that referrals for assessment and investigation of febrile seizures should be undertaken earlier to exclude a more severe underlying illness.
 
2. Information provided to parents/guardians after their child had a Febrile Seizure 
Evidence was heard that the NHS website and pamphlet provided to parents/guardians following a child’s febrile seizure is insufficiently informative to provide parents with sufficiently detailed information to assist them in picking up potential early indicators of a more severe illness
e.g. issues with gait, co-ordination, definition of complex seizures, developmental regression etc.
 
3. Improvement to and highlighting of the JRCALC guidelines for paramedic management of seizures in children JRCALC guidelines indicated paramedics should have conveyed Louis to hospital or contacted the GP and/or Out of Hours GP service following Louis’s second seizure on 11th February 2020, as the close proximity of two seizures indicated it was a ‘complex febrile seizure’ rather than a febrile seizure. This led to a lost opportunity to expeditiously trigger further investigation and/or a referral to either the ‘first seizure’ service or to a specialist paediatrician for further assessment and management. Evidence was heard that improving and highlighting JRCALC guidelines with additional teaching would prevent this happening again.",On 8th February 2022 I recommenced an investigation into the death of Louis James Rogers.

24/03/2023,22/03/2023,2023-0100,Kenneth Adams,Bredan Allen,Dorset,Emergency services related deaths (2019 onwards),International Academies of Emergency Dispatch,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/kenneth-adams-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kenneth-Adams-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0100_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-0110-Response-from-Hull-City-Council.pdf | https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/2023-0100-Response-from-International-Academics-of-Emergency-Dispatch.pdf,"At approximately 3.30am on 19th October 2021, Kenneth Michael Adams, who was prescribed clopidogrel and who lived alone at 60 Vernons Court in Bridport, which is supported housing provided by a housing association, suffered an accidental fall from a standing height, which resulted in a laceration to his scalp. At 4.06 am Mr Adams contacted the ambulance service to explain that he had fallen, injured his scalp and that he could not stop the bleeding. Mr Adams’ call was triaged using the Medical Priority Despatch System, which resulted in a disposition of 17-b-01: fall possible dangerous area. This translated to a category 3 ambulance response. The national target set by the Department of Health is to attend category 3 incidents within 120 minutes on at least 90% of occasions (so by 6.13 am), with an average response time of 60 minutes (by 5.13am). At the time of this call, Mr Adams appeared well with no additional symptoms. Mr Adams had also activated his careline, which is an element of the support provided by the housing association. At 7.53 an operator from the careline contacted Mr Adams to check on his welfare. Mr Adams reported that he was now feeling sick, that he was wobbly when stood up and that his bleeding was continuing. The careline operator contacted the ambulance service and advised of the new symptoms. A further triage was conducted, with the same disposition of fall, possibly dangerous area being reached, as the algorithm being used failed to account for the persistent nature of the bleeding being experienced and that Mr Adams was prescribed clopidogrel. At 10.25 Mr Adams again spoke to a careline operator. He was by now slurring his words and his speech was noticeably slow. It is likely he was experiencing symptoms associated with hypovolaemic shock. If Mr Adams had received treatment  by 10.25, he would have survived the injury he had sustained. The first ambulance resource arrived at Mr Adams’ property at 11.56, by which time a neighbour had found Mr Adams when Mr Adams had called for his help. Mr Adams was conveyed to Dorset County Hospital, where despite treatment he died on 19th October 2021.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:
i. A patient, prescribed either antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, falling and sustaining a scalp laceration that is not “spurting or pouring blood” (the MPDS definition of “uncontrolled bleeding”), will never reach an MPDS disposition that results in a prioritisation higher than category 3, regardless of how long the bleeding has been persisting, unless the patient becomes unconscious or stops breathing. I heard evidence that the scalp is an area of high venous blood flow, such that a laceration to the scalp is capable of bleeding significantly. However, because of the nature of the blood supply in this area, the wound will not “spurt or pour” blood, so with the current iteration of MPDS a wound in this area of the body can never be considered as “serious haemorrhage”. Despite this, when assessing the seriousness of a bleed that does not meet the criteria for a “serious haemorrhage”, the MPDS algorithm does not allow for consideration of any delay in treatment or for the consideration of medications that may either exacerbate the extent of a bleed or prevent the blood from clotting to stop the bleed. For a patient such as Mr Adams, prescribed antiplatelet medication, there is a considerable risk that the bleeding will persist until the wound is closed, such that a delay in receiving treatment, where the wound continues to bleed, leaves the patient at risk of developing hypovolaemic shock.","On the 5th November 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Kenneth Michael Adams, born on the 2l5t August 1951. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 9th March 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
My principal concern is that having heard evidence from the Trust as to ‘lessons learnt’ and its current processes for identifying when Trust clinical policies and guidance needs updating, and where essential equipment needs to be obtained and located, I remain unclear that the Trust now has sufficiently robust processes in place to prevent similarly avoidable deaths to that of Chloe. Indeed, I am unclear that the processes are substantively different to those that existed at the time of Chloe’s death.
 
It was of very particular concern to hear that clinicians at the time were aware of revised national pregnancy guidance issued in September 2018 but this had not been incorporated into Trust policy and guidance. I was told that introducing revised guidance was necessarily complex and lengthy and yet the Trust did incorporate the revised guidance just several weeks following Chloe’s death and it appears because of her death. It was also very concerning to hear that the Trust had established a regional pregnancy service using out of date guidance. Certain changes relating to the circumstances of Chloe’s death have only very recently been addressed or are in process; for example, the procedure to call and respond to a major maternal haemorrhage was to be tested a week or two after the inquest.
 
I therefore consider that the Trust should review its processes for identifying when Trust clinical policies and guidance needs updating, and where essential equipment needs to be obtained and located, in the interests of preventing future deaths, and that those processes should ensure timely revisions and associated actions.",On 9 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rachael Chloe WALKER aged 36.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 
(1) During the 2½ years in which Charlotte’s mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2½ years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte.
 
I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.
 
I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.
 
(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte’s referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so.
 
I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future.","[the details below are fictional]   
On 27 July 2021 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Charlotte Comer. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 February 2023.

The collision occurred when the deceased pulled out of a side road, Pittington Road, into the path of a vehicle travelling in the outside lane of the A690.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
During the course of the Inquest evidence was heard from the lead road traffic collision investigator in the case that there are significant concerns in relation to the adequacy and layout of this particular junction and the five other junctions on this stretch of road (A690). Evidence was given that since this fatality, there has been another fatal road traffic collision on the 22/12/22, at the junction directly opposite. Further that between 11/01/00 and 31/12/22 there have been 21 collisions at this junction (including this fatality and 3 other serious collisions) and that there have been 29 collisions at the other junctions on this stretch of road (including one further fatality and 6 other serious collisions).
 
The concerns in relation to this junction, and the other junctions relate to:-
1.  The volume of traffic that the junctions must manage.
2.  The complexity of traffic movement at the junctions.
3.  The speed limit in the vicinity of the junctions.
 
Concerns were also raised in relation to the planned extensive expansion/development of the area in the vicinity of the junction, including increased housing development, a proposed retail park, football site, as well as developments occurring more widely in the area which will lead to increased traffic, and that any proposed improvements to the junction are not required until prior to the occupation of the 39th dwelling on the site. The concern is that the proposals to improve the safety of the junction are not sufficient nor timely, and that consideration does not appear to have been given to reducing the speed limit within the junction series. A further concern was raised that the proposed improvements to the junction considered this junction in isolation, and did not consider the series of junctions on this
stretch of road.",On 12/07/2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Kelly Nicola DUNNE. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20/02/2023. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 08, 2023.

At the time of step-down she presented as anxious in relation to her medication and showed a dependence to clonazepam. A medical plan was set to wean her off the clonazepam on the 26 May 2022, with no carefully devised risk management plan put in place. There was no care co-ordinator visit following the medical review on the 26 May 2022. On the 7 June 2022, Evelina was found hanging in the basement of her home address. A paramedic pronounced her life extinct on scene. Police deemed the circumstances as non- suspicious. A note was found which contains Evelina’s stated intention to take her own life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

2. On the 26th May 2022 when a decision was made to wean Evelina from the Clonazepam medication there was no detailed risk assessment or risk management plan. It was agreed in evidence that there was an increased risk to self at this time. No additional steps were put in place to ensure insofar as possible, that Evelina was kept safe.
 
3. Following the medical review on the 26th May 2022 there were no further care co-ordinator reviews.

She was an outpatient under the care of psychiatrists at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton from 7 February 2018 until 20 August 2021. She was noted as not always engaging with medical professionals and disclosed that she had been self-medicating.   ","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
Although a discharge plan was implemented in Ms. Findlay’s case, it would appear that steps were not taken to contact her emergency contact and/or next of kin, such as to facilitate Ms. Findlay being supported in the community upon discharge. Ms. Findlay, having discharged herself, left the hospital with next of kin/ emergency contacts not being aware of her discharge – despite, her emergency contact being the person who had transported her to the Priory Hospital. No follow up appointment was made prior to Ms. Findlay’s discharge and no attempts were made to contact her following her discharge until 6 September 2021.
 
The matters of concern are as follows:
A.  That no contact was made with next of kin/ emergency contacts prior to, or at the time of her release.
B.  No follow up appointment was booked prior to Ms. Findlay’s discharge.
No attempt was made to contact Ms. Findlay until 6 September 2021 (some 10 days following her discharge).","On 27 September 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Annabel Jean Findlay who died aged 56 years’ old.

(b)     As a trans person, she was particularly vulnerable to stress.
(c)     After she moved to London, Sophie came to experience episodes of psychosis and dissociation which became increasingly frequent and intensive, during which she lacked capacity freely to make decisions, and was liable not only to self-harm (as happened frequently) but also, in particular, to take an overdose of the drugs prescribed for her (as she did on 23 March 2021).
(d)     She “stockpiled” her prescription drugs, but Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust (“the Trust”) gave her no warning not to do so, and did not take steps to alert her GP that she was doing so, which contributed to Sophie having access to enough drugs to amount to an overdose.
(e)     The trauma and stress experienced by Sophie could cause or contribute to a dissociative episode, and were a strong risk factor for someone with a personality disorder (as Sophie was).
(t)       The stress, and hence the risk of further psychotic and dissociative episodes – with the risk to her life that those entailed – was present and continuing, and was exacerbated by the following:
 
(1) Her concern that the Trust had not provided her with, or with certainty that she had, a long-term care plan.
(2) Her anxiety that the Trust had not provided her with a key-worker, and that she had very limited prospects of quickly and easily getting short-term, crisis help, if she were to need it.
(3) The Structured Clinical Management (SCM”) practitioner at the Trust made remarks to Sophie, as a trans woman, which were highly inappropriate. Sophie may have forgiven her for doing so, but the negative effect of those remarks remained.
(4)  Although the Trust recognised “The risks of withdrawing the antipsychotic completely would be that Sophie would experience a deterioration in her symptoms:….an increase in paranoia,” it advised Sophie to stop her antipsychotic medication, which she had done by 12 May 2021.
(5) The Trust did not conduct its own diagnosis of Sophie’s condition, or conditions. There was thus no check on whether Sophie did (in fact), have dissociative identity disorder, or dissociative amnesia (as was not suspected until after her death), and the treatment which the Trust did provide was determined accordingly.
(6) The Trust did not carry out any, or any adequate, assessment of the ever­ present risk of overdose death posed to Sophie by the consequences of the psychotic and dissociative episodes, and by the other stress factors in her life, and thus did not actively consider, and hence did not take, steps to address that risk.
(7)  The SCM provided by the Trust was, objectively, appropriate, in relation to certain aspects of the EUPD, but it was not adequate to, and did not, address that present and continuing short-term risk, which was also a
recognised aspect of it. Sophie herself did not find it helpful.
(8)  The mental health practitioner who conducted the SCM sessions did not fulfil the function of the key-worker to which Sophie had become accustomed in Belfast, and whose support she had found helpful.
The announcement (made twice) by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust (“the GIC”) (that time which Sophie had spent waiting for treatment by the Brackenburg GIC in Belfast would not count towards her waiting-time. for the GIC) was “devastating” and left her “raging”. Those effeqts were not negatived by the call which the GIC had promised to make to Sophie, and which she was expecting to receive.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur, unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN, for trans persons on a Personality Disorder Pathway, arise out of the lack of provision of the following:
(A) by local NHS Trusts:
(1)  The assignment of a single, named point of contact, available (aside from holiday and sickness absence) when needed by the patient
(2)  The training of staff assigned to provide care and treatment to such persons, both at the time of their appointment, and annually thereafter, with a focus on:
(a)  the needs of trans persons
(b)  gender-affirming care
(c)  dissociation and psychosis
(3)   Scrutiny of the delivery and implementation of such training, by way of quality assurance.
(4)  The absence from the assessment protocol of a provision to ensure that full account
is taken of:
(a)  any previous diagnosis and treatment
(b)  all other information (including information from those who have previously provided care and treatment to the patient) available to members of the team
(c)   the risks to (and effects on) patients with (or likely to develop) conditions of dissociation and/or psychosis including, in particular, the risks of self-harm and loss of life
(d)  the views of those who are close to the patient, including the patient’s carers, family and advocates (both formal and informal), who should be contacted, for that purpose
(B) By clinics providing gender-identity treatment (and in relation to both current and prospective patients):
(1)  a help-line, available when needed by patients
(2)  the direction of patients to specialist carers
(3)  provision of mental health care for those patients on waiting-lists
(4)  liaison (at both local and national levels) among all clinicians concerned (or expected to be concerned) in the care and treatment of such patients
(5)  the setting and implementation (where practicable) of criteria for deciding whether (and, if so, which) patients (other than those terminally ill) should be given priority for receiving treatment","On 24 May 2021, the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of SOPHIE GWEN WILLIAMS, aged 28.

Mr Seaby was assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist [“SALT”]. A SALT Care Plan was in place with regard to his nutrition which included specific requirements that he be given only soft, moist and mashed food, with two specific exceptions and that he was to be supervised throughout meals on a one-to-one basis with a ten minute gap between food and drink and for ten minutes afterwards. The Care Plan stated it was “essential” the Plan was adhered to and specifically provided that if the requirements were not adhered to, Mr Seaby was at risk of aspiration and asphyxiation “which are potentially life threatening”. Evidence was heard that Mr Seaby was not always given food which complied with the Care Plan and he was not always provided with supervision in compliance with his Care Plan.

It was recognised there may be difficulties in applying any such power from a practical perspective. Of note, there was no easy way, other than an Officer returning to a property, to check whether a key being retained was actually a house key.

She worked for Transport for London and had an accident over 20 years ago where she injured her back. This resulted in continuing chronic back pain for which she took prescribed medication. Family report that she was not very good at managing this medication.   ,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Ms Campbell had experienced a work-place related accident approximately 20 years prior to her death when she had fallen off a broken chair at work. She suffered with back pain, which became chronic, thereafter. She had a number of interventions including referral and attendance at pain clinics, manual therapy, CBT and pharmaceuticals.
During her time with pain no clear cause was identified on MRI and other imaging. She was treated for chronic low back pain of indeterminate cause.
Over the years she was treated with multiple, and escalating doses of, medications. These included at the time of her death, diazepam [REDACTED], amitriptyline [REDACTED], tramadol [REDACTED], gabapentin [REDACTED] and fentanyl patches [REDACTED] to be applied every 72 hours.
She was found collapsed at home in her bathroom and there was a possibility of a positional component to the respiratory depression consequent on the long-lie. The medical cause of death was given by the pathologist [REDACTED] as 1a Central Respiratory Depression 1b Tramadol excess with fentanyl II Long lie following a fall, chronic post traumatic back injury.
The police and paramedics attending the scene describe the finding of “hundreds” of packets of medications, some opened, some unopened.
This polypharmacy was identified by the pathologist who conducted the post mortem (taking from the toxicology report) as “In summary, excess Tramadol [REDACTED] and a metabolite [REDACTED] are indicative of recent moderately excessive ingestion prior to death. Although lower than levels typically seen in fatalities, the moderate excess in conjunction with other prescribed drugs, most notably fentanyl are sufficient to have produced central respiratory depression. No other significant post mortem findings were noted, and the prolonged lie following a fall may well have contributed a postural component to the respiratory depression”
Her GP [REDACTED] gave clear and candid evidence. I accept the management of patients who describe intractable debilitating pain is challenging and difficult and that requests for other or increasing doses of medication can be difficult to resist. [REDACTED] agreed that the prescribing of the various drugs identified had potential to be dangerous. He told me that after a certain point the benefits of increasing or adding doses or medications in terms of pain relief were minimal. This scenario seems to be an invidious one for GP’s and patients alike.
[REDACTED] told me that subsequent to Ms Campbell’s death the practice had convened and discussed the circumstances and agreed on regular reviews for patients taking these sorts of medication. There were no plans identified to actively look for these patients and to work to rationalize and / or reduce their medications.
I am of the view that polypharmacy including gabapentinoids and opiates represents a severe safety risk in patients with a iatrogenic drug dependency. I consider that the risk in individuals like Ms Campbell of an inadvertent overdose of medications which have a cumulative and synergistic effect to depress the central nervous system can easily become extreme and lead to death. There have been a number of deaths in the Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire and Luton areas related to concomitant use of high dose and combination gabapentinoids and opioids.",On 04 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Sharman CAMPBELL aged 56. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 February 2023.

Mr Parsons had spent the evening of Friday 22 April 2022 at the Porthleven Food Festival. He had been due to meet up with his wife at a rented holiday cottage in Porthleven on the morning of Saturday 23 April 2022. He failed to meet her as planned and was uncontactable.
 
The police search revealed that Mr Parsons was last seen just before midnight on 22 April 2022 by a witness in the in the big tent at the harbour. The witness stated that Mr Parsons did not seem to be drunk at the time that they were speaking.
 
On 4 May 2022 the fully clothed body of Mr Parsons was recovered from the sea, approximately 4 miles off the coast of the Isles of Scilly after being spotted by a fisherman.
 
The post-mortem revealed no injuries and gave the cause of death identified above. Toxicology shows raised urine ethanol (alcohol) at 291 mg / 100 ML. For comparison, the legal driving limit alcohol in urine is 107 mg / 100 ML urine.
 
The Inquest findings were as follows
·       Mr Parsons died after midnight, on 23 April 2023 after falling into the harbour waters and drowning.
·       Due to Mr Parsons body being located fully clothed, he fell into the water by accident and not through choice.
That if Mr Parsons was still conscious and was able to shout for help, he is unlikely to have been heard by anyone due to the noise of the ongoing events.
·       The alcohol consumed by Mr Parsons made it more likely that when entering the water this would increase the risk of drowning due to impairment of cognition and motor skills.
·       Police evidence revealed that the sea off Porthleven features a notorious current that means it is not safe to swim in the harbour.
·       The pier and harbour walls raised safety issues discussed below under matters of concern. The police evidence was that these safety issues amounted to a failing to ensure the safety of members of the public.
Responsibility for public safety rests with the Porthleven Harbour & Dock Company as the owners of the harbour, and with Cornwall Council as the licensing authority for the Food Festival.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1 Response requested from Secretary of State for Education and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
Lance was only exposed to his killer because he was obliged to live in the designated accommodation. Although the 2 relevant Councils were duty bound to house both individuals up until the age of 21 under the Leaving Care Act, there is currently no regulation for the over 18’s. Regulation is being introduced for 16- 17 year olds in April 2023.
 
Both Councils were in agreement that Regulation of this sector would be welcomed to support them in carrying out their statutory obligations . A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC’s regulation as the provision is not for “care” but support. The provision is made from an entirely un-regulated sector, resulting in some organisations offering accommodation with inadequate training, staffing or knowledge to meet the complex needs of some of our most vulnerable individuals. Consideration should be given to introducing regulation for at least 18-21 year old individuals. This issue remains a concern for all those who work within it.","On 17 July 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lance Scott Walker, age 18 .

As part of the fabric of some of the buildings on the farm, pre-cast concrete panels were used extensively, predominately as external walls for barns or similar. Typically, the concrete panels, which weigh approximately 800kg, are placed between vertical reinforced steel joists (RSJs), secured to the RSJ by means of a metal bracket bolted to the concrete panel. On Hawkins Farm two concrete panels had been repurposed from another building to form a divide between a “collecting yard” (an area where cattle are held prior to be being encouraged into the milking parlour) and an adjacent barn where straw was stored, with one panel placed on top of the other, to form a wall that was approximately 6 feet in height. The concrete panels did not stretch between the two RSJs present. As a consequence, one side was secured using the above-described method, with the other side being secured using sections of steel “box” (hollow steel tubing) welded to the RSJ and “clipped” against the rear of the concrete panel using a metal bracket. On 30th January 2021, Mr Woods was in the collecting yard when the upper concrete panel that divided the collecting yard from the straw storage came away from its fixing, causing multiple injuries to Mr Woods, who was sadly confirmed deceased at the scene.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

However, Mr Roberts had in the past been convicted of a violent offence for which he had received a custodial sentence. This was the reason for his dismissal from his former occupation as a police officer in the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service).
 
If Mr Roberts’ DBS certificate had correctly recorded his conviction, he would not have been employed at Proof House where he had access to firearms.
 
It is unclear to me whether the inaccuracy of the DBS certificate was caused by an error made by the DBS or by the MPS.","On 30 August 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Roberts aged 50 years.

They outlined that approximately 15 metres from where Mr Easdale crossed the road, there was a traffic island (or pedestrian refuge) with a bollard and streetlamp in place. The bollard on the island is made out of opaque white plastic and is designed to be illuminated from within. The time of the collision was around 5pm on a December afternoon meaning that this stretch of road was in deep darkness.
 
When the collision occurred on the 5th November 2021, neither the illuminated bollard nor the streetlamp were in working order and were therefore unlit. Both officers from the collision unit gave evidence that this situation presented a danger to road users and pedestrians.
 
A Traffic Management Officer has brought this situation to the attention of Hertfordshire County Council, Highways England (now National Highways) and National Power Networks (now UK Power Networks).
 
Despite this, I heard evidence at the inquest that both the bollard and the streetlamp have still not been repaired and remain unlit even in the hours of darkness.
 
I was not able to say on the balance of probabilities that the lack of lighting on the pedestrian island
contributed to Mr Easdale’s death as he was not using the crossing itself when he was struck. He crossed nearby, however, and it is possible that had there been illumination at that island the driver of the car would have seen him earlier and potentially avoided the collision.
 
I am satisfied that the lack of working lights at this location on the B197 Digswell Hill poses a danger to road users and pedestrians. The location of the island is near to the Red Lion Public House and may be used by people going to and from the pub.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
Chris was known to abscond from secure mental health detention during periods of “escorted leave”. He had left the care of the Trust on 6 occasions during his final 3 month detention and was known to purchase and take illicit drugs on these occasions. His Consultant had discussed this high risk behaviour with him on many occasions.
 
(1) The Consultant Psychiatrist had signed the agreed escorted leave form on the basis that Chris would be accompanied 1:1 with a nurse. The purpose of the leave was therapeutic, to enable Chris to access the community in a supported manner. Evidence was before the court that the leave was only to the adjacent car park, to facilitate a smoking break, and 1 member of staff accompanied up to 6 patients. The Trust’s own Root Cause Analysis report confirms that the practise was at this time for 1 staff member to accompany those patients who wished to smoke to the adjacent carpark.
 
(2) The car park is entirely unsecure and open to the road. Evidence given in court was that the hospital site is non-smoking, but the evidence was unclear whether the car park was considered to be part of the hospital site or separate.
 
(3) My concern is that there has been a tolerated blurring of the boundaries between the intentions of escorted leave for individuals under a MHA section, and the ward staff’s ability to facilitate this in a meaningful and therapeutic way to benefit the patients, and that the clinical staff were not aware of this. Chris had indicated his desire to access the cash point and buy Christmas presents for his family, but there was no suggestion these requests had been considered by the Trust and either approved or refused. Chris therefore made the decision to leave the ward, with catastrophic consequences. Has the Trust given any consideration to the provision of a “safe” smoking area that patients can access without the need to be accompanied or to use their restricted escorted leave for this purpose alone?",On 31 December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Thomas Ace RYAN.

She was then taken to Wythenshawe Hospital. There was a delay in triage due to demands on the Emergency Department. Triage did not pick up on her being a potential silver trauma case. A CT scan was not ordered at that time. She was triaged to be seen within 1 hour. ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
1.     Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;
 
2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;
 
3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;
 
4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival.",On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson. The investigation concluded on the 12th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from injuries sustained in a road traffic collision where there was a delay in identifying the severity of the injuries sustained. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7th April 2022.

She was successfully treated with chemo/radiotherapy. She was referred to Tameside General Hospital for a post treatment endoscopy. In December 2021 an endoscopy identified a tight pinhole stricture. A stent was inserted as it was suspected that there was a perforation. The type of stent inserted required removal within 6 weeks in a case such as Mrs Lomax’s.   ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
1.       The inquest heard evidence that the development of oesophageal strictures such as Mrs Lomax’s was a relatively new development as a consequence of advances in chemo/radiotherapy that meant that surgery was not the only option for oesophageal cancers. However the management of theses strictures was complicated and there was no detailed national guidance on management of them and in particular when and how stenting should be approached. The development and implementation of detailed National Guidance was the inquest was told key to improving outcomes for patients such as Mrs Lomax across England;
 
2.       Within Greater Manchester the inquest was told that the Christie were seeking to develop a specialist service for these complex cases but funding of a commissioned pan GM service was fundamental to a successful roll out that would benefit such patients as Mrs Lomax. The absence of such a service meant that cases such as Mrs Lomax’s could arise going forward given that in most hospitals even experienced radiologists/gastroenterologists would have limited experience on how to manage such cases;
 
3.       The inquest also heard evidence that to support management of cases such as Mrs Lomax there was a regular GM Upper GI MDT led by Salford Royal Hospital. However staffing issues meant that there was not a regular presence for all Trusts at the meeting. This impacted effective communication and impacted patient care;
 
This was compounded by the fact that the inquest heard evidence that the MDT did not have a system of effective communication of agreed actions and recommendations for individual patients discussed at the MDT. As a consequence local clinicians were unsighted as to the recommended way forward.

She was admitted into Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr on 5 April 2021. Whilst she was an inpatient she had three falls. The first fall caused superficial head injury, the second fall caused a right fractured neck of femur and the third caused Mrs White to suffer a moderately displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the right proximal femur. Following the third fall she underwent surgery at the Grange University Hospital but when recovering from that surgery her condition deteriorated and she died.   ","During the course of the inquest, evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
   
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
Evidence received during the investigation and inquest (and corroborated by the family) demonstrated that nursing staff were trying to manage and care for patients in the very best way that they could. However, they were hampered in their efforts for the following reasons:
 
1.       Despite requesting additional nursing staff, the Bargeod ward was short-staffed when Mrs White fell. There did not appear to be any documented plan or procedure in place for how patients would be safely managed when it was not possible (because of staff shortage) to carry out the level of care for individual patients that they had been assessed as requiring.
 
2.       The ward is L-shaped and the patients on the ward are managed in individual cubicles. Mrs White should have been in view of nursing staff as part of her Level 4 enhanced care (‘observation of cohorted patients’). However, it was not possible to provide the observations that Mrs White required because:
a.    Patients were inside cubicles and therefore out of sight of staff and,
b.    The ward itself was L-shaped.
 
3.       The Bargoed ward is a stroke ward and one where it is usual to see patients who have a high risk of falls and mobility difficulties. Prior to Covid-19 it was explained that staff would take patients who required the Enhanced Care to the dayroom so that they could be under the required observation. Since Covid-19, this had not been possible. To counteract the logistical difficulties faced by staff in observation of Enhanced Care patients on the ward it was explained that patients are now moved to their cubicle doorway for periods of the day so that they are in sight of nursing staff. This appeared to be ineffective because:
a.    The particular care needs/wishes of a patient may mean that is not suitable.
b.    That only accounts for part of the day.
 
4.       To further counteract the difficulties with observing patients on Enhanced Level 4 care it was explained that clip-on alarm sensors were used. There was evidence given that patients are able to simply unclip these sensors, rendering the system ineffective.
 
A Falls Review Panel had noted that Providing Level 4 Enhanced Care on this ward was extremely challenging and that quality care at Level 4 was unachievable in a single room environment. It was noted that the Corporate Nursing Team had reviewed the Enhanced Care Policy in light of the fact it did not fit single room environment, however at the time of the inquest it did not appear from evidence received that a further plan to manage Level",On an investigation was opened on 22 June 2021 into the death of Mary Doreen White.,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 01 April 2023.

It was found that she had methanol in her system which had caused her death. Methanol is not meant for human consumption. She had inadvertently consumed methanol believing she had consumed alcohol.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The Inquest heard evidence that there is a growing problem of methanol being passed off as alcohol for human consumption particularly in places such as Bali. Methanol is used rather than ethanol in spirits aimed at the Western market and sold even through apparently reputable suppliers.
 
The evidence before the Inquest was that :
1.  Knowledge of the problem amongst the expatriate/tourist community was very low despite the increase in the problem and the catastrophic consequences of methanol consumption;
 
2.  There was little publicity by the UK Government of the risk in contrast to the approach taken by the Australian Government who had undertaken a campaign to increase awareness to protect their citizens travelling in areas of Asia such as Bali;
 
3.  The UK Government publicising information about the risk of methanol being used in local spirits, steps that could be taken by UK nationals travelling to reduce the risk and warning signs of methanol toxicity would help to reduce the chance of others dying in the way in which Kirsty McKie died",On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Margaret McKie. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 1st April 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The inquest has highlighted an ongoing concern that Oncology Consultants will continue to be the lead Consultants for care of APML patients at Alder Hey Trust. The most significant risk of death in such patients is due to the risk of serious bleeding due to the associated and significant coagulopathy. Coagulopathy management should be led by a Haematologist to prevent future deaths due to this issue, that was recognised by a Consultant Haematologist who gave evidence to the inquest as a expert witness and as supported by a leading Haematologist at the Trust.

He was taken to hospital and underwent CT examination. No fractures were reported. Following further investigations he was discharged home. Following discharge Donald continued to experience neck pain and difficulty swallowing. He was readmitted to hospital on the 26th February 2021 and was treated for aspiration pneumonia. Further CT imaging demonstrated that he had suffered a displaced fracture of the C2 vertebra with spinal cord compression. This injury had been sustained in his fall on the 31st January. It was visible on the CT imaging taken on that day. However it was not reported. It is likely that the severity of this injury led to his swallowing difficulties and caused aspiration pneumonia.

She had had a 35 year history with mental health services. Samantha arrived at Sturdee Community Hospital (a locked female rehabilitation ward) in June of 2020, when her community placement had broken down and she could no longer be safely managed within the community.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)
1. Emergency Response
 
I heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency.
 
At the time of Samantha’s death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward.
 
Staff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patient’s side.
 
However, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patient’s side.
 
I was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating.
 
To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients’ side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths.
 
The delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient.
 
2. Observation Policy
 
At the time of Samantha’s death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samantha’s death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing.
 
Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient.
 
Inmind Healthcare Group’s new observation Policy states:
 
‘Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice…….
Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us’.
 
Since Samantha’s death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour).
 
Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice.
 
However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording.  This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were doing, the actual presentation of the patient was not being recorded.","On 29 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Jane BOAZMAN aged 54.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
It became clear in the inquest that the commission, funding, assessment and provision of care needs is a complex process involving, particularly as in Matthews case, where there are multiple agencies involved due to his own complex and multifaceted needs.  In this case it has been established that there was a confusion over the care in how it was funded and expected to be provided, compared to that which was understood to be funded and actually provided on the ground to Matthew. The confusion appears to have arisen over the understanding of a number of care terms and the use of them which has resulted in 2 commissioning agencies and an agency providing the care having differing views about Matthews care and that which should have been in place and that which was in place.",On 07 January 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Harter DALE aged 43.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1.       The ELFT serious incident (SI) review report identified that, although Mr Largin was discharged to the Woodberry Wetlands neighbourhood rehabilitation team from the crisis (i.e. home treatment) team on 25 January 2022, the neighbourhood team did not allocate him to a team member until 3 February.
2.       The report also identified that, despite receiving an email from the Homerton University Hospital community rehabilitation team on 2 February, saying that Mr Largin had been seen on 1 February and was still very depressed, the crisis team failed to reassess him or to re-open his case to the crisis team, but instead referred the community team to the neighbourhood team.
3.       However, the SI report did not identify that the crisis team member who made the decision on 2 February simply to advise that Mr Largin should be dealt with by the neighbourhood team failed to record any reasons for her decision.
4.       The SI reviewer giving evidence in court said that the SI reviewing team had not even spoken to that crisis team member as part of their investigation, let alone fed back to her.
5.      He said they did not at the time realise that she still worked for ELFT, though he accepted that it would have been an extremely straight forward matter to find out. The crisis team member’s manager gave evidence that she thought the relevant decision maker had left the team before Mr Largin’s death, so between 3 and 6 February 2022. When I invited that manager to make a call while the inquest was ongoing to check, she later told me that the team member had not left the crisis team until 29 April 2022.
6.    It is believed, I was told, that there was a hot de-brief after Mr Largin’s death. However, no notes were made of that and no entry was made on Mr Largin’s medical record.
7.     Thus, nobody from ELFT found out what the decision maker’s thinking had been, or what misconceptions she might have had that other staff members might share. The former crisis team member who made the decision still works for ELFT. As far as I could ascertain, her decision making concerning Mr Largin has never been discussed with her by ELFT managers.
8.     The SI review also did not identify that members of the crisis team and the neighbourhood team did not share an understanding of how quickly the neighbourhood team aims to make contact with patients, to assist in their decision making about the correct pathway for a patient. In fact, a member of the neighbourhood team itself gave evidence about the response times that, I was told later, was not correct.
9.      Finally, the operations lead for the neighbourhood team had great difficulty in giving me clear evidence about whether his team would or could refer a patient back to the crisis team if they felt the circumstances warranted. He demonstrated a lack of clarity on the point that I found very concerning.","On 10 February 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew Mark Largin, aged 60 years.

Cattle in the field approached them, knocked them down and trampled them, causing serious injuries. Emergency treatment was provided by a doctor who arrived by helicopter. Mr Holmes could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 12:56 that day at the scene of the incident.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 
  
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   
1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. 
  
1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  
 
1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.
 
1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.
 
1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the ‘application’). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as “essential.”
 
1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest. The application may well eliminate altogether the risk identified in the incident field.","On 1 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John Holmes, aged 57.

At about 09:15rs on Monday 31st May 2021 officers have been made aware of a concern for the wellbeing of PS DUIGNAN and they have been asked to make a search of the airport policing unit offices located at Percival Way Luton.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Sean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.
The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.
Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter [REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.
Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was [REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed – incorrectly – single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Sean’s access had been restricted she would not, I am
certain, have allowed him entry.","On 10 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sean Gerard DUIGNAN aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
 
Sean Gerard Duignan was a well respected, well liked and universally helpful base sergeant at the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit (South Base). On the 29th May 2021 he was arrested following reports of a vehicle being driven erratically and dangerously. A Bedfordshire Police sergeant visited him at his home to conduct what was initially to be a welfare check. Sean was intoxicated with alcohol and was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of drink or drug driving. He remained in custody until the following afternoon when he was released under investigations. Multiple and serial enquiries were made by members of the custody and health care staff at Milton Keynes Police Custody suite to determine his mental health and to keep him safe. Those checks were repeated on release. They were continued by the police federation representatives and his close friend [REDACTED]. All seemed well. The next day, a day off, Sean travelled to the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit where the South Base armoury is located. The armoury security was lax and had been for a prolonged period. The computer system used for electronic access was repeatedly failing but seemingly no coherent approach was taken to remedy this. The back up master armoury key was kept in a PIN protected locked box, but the PIN number was universally known. Because of an error in the computerised system an officer was allocated single point access when she should not have been. She unwittingly let Sean, whose own access to the armoury had been restricted without his colleagues being informed, into the armoury. He took a hand gun and ammunition, entered the base gym and shot himself in the head.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 13, 2023.

Resuscitation algorithm (4 H’s & 4 T’s)* for PEA cardiac arrest
 I heard evidence that the 4 H’s and 4 T’s should be considered and excluded in any PEA cardiac arrest situation. Steps were taken to treat anaphylaxis, but in the absence of any improvement in Teegan’s clinical condition, and whilst it was mentioned, no steps were taken to exclude possible bilateral tension pneumothoraces. Evidence was heard at the Inquest that it is the only one of the 4 H’s and 4 T’s (see footnote) that directly results in a sudden inability to ventilate, with the HSIB report indicating that there was sufficient time to consider and exclude this possibility given the length of time of the PEA cardiac arrest.
 
2. Surgical emphysem
There was a delay in the recognition of surgical emphysema by clinical attendees at the cardiac arrest (medical specialist registrar, consultant obstetricians, anaesthetic core trainee, anaesthetic specialist registrar and the on call consultant anaesthetist) despite indicative clinical signs of deep cyanosis, gross whole body swelling with the need to remove the increasingly constrictive hospital wrist band and endotracheal tube tie, alongside sub-cutaneous crepitus and an abdominal drainage bag noted to be tense with air.
 
3. Investigation after Teegan’s death
Following this incident, and despite Teegan being intubated and ventilated at the time, with a real possibility of this being an anaesthetic related event, no steps were taken by the anaesthetic department at St Richard’s Hospital, Chichester, either before or after the publication of the HSIB report, to explore potential iatrogenic or other anaesthetic related causes (such as exposure of Teegan’s lungs to excessive volume or pressure) as a possible or probable cause of Teegan’s death.
 
Furthermore, the anaesthetic machine/ventilator was not taken out of service and assessed to see if there was a fault. Neither was the data from the anaesthetic machine downloaded and interrogated, which may have assisted in establishing how Teegan came to develop bilateral tension pneumothoraces during her emergence from general anaesthesia.
 
The failure of the anaesthetic department to undertake any morbidity or mortality review/meeting following Teegan’s death led to a lost opportunity to share any possible learning opportunities both within and outside their department to prevent future deaths, and as a corollary to have been in a position to fully assist both the investigation by the HSIB and the inquest hearing.
 
4. Trust Clinical Governance procedures
The senior management team within the Trust have not acknowledged that there was a lack of a proper and robust system in place to trigger an investigation into all the circumstances of the death of a 17-year-old patient, with no steps taken by them to do so either before or after the publication of the HSIB report or at any time prior to the Inquest hearing.
 
This gives rise to a concern of a lack of insight within the senior management team of the importance of undertaking a comprehensive investigation into unexpected deaths within their organisation and for there to be wider dissemination of any institutional learning with the aim of preventing future deaths.
 
The failure of the Trust to fully investigate how Teegan came by her death also gives rise to a concern regarding the Trust’s obligation to comply with the Statutory Duty of Candour and their requirement to share their findings with both the regulators and Teegan’s family as well as to indicate the steps, if any, they have taken to prevent future deaths.",On 7th January 2022 I resumed an investigation into the death of Teegan Marie Barnard.

Since that time, he had been under the care of the community mental health team with a period of care under the home treatment team in July 2021 following a short admission for a relapse in his condition. At his last review in September 2021, he was noted to be well but concern was expressed about lack of compliance with medication due to some side effects. On 02/12/21 he was noted by a resident at his shared accommodation to be hallucinating, having smashed a window and threated to eat the glass. Police and paramedics attended and he was taken to Good Hope Hospital emergency department where he arrived at 01.45. He was assessed by the mental health liaison service and a psychiatric doctor as needing a full Mental Health Act assessment which was undertaken at 11.30 on 03/12/21. The assessment concluded that he did require further treatment due to a relapse in his condition caused by non- compliance with his medication. He agreed to a voluntary admission, further assessment and recommencement of his medication. He remained in the Emergency department whilst attempts were made to find a bed. At the time there was a national shortage of mental health beds. Staff from the hospital notified the police that he had left the department at 13.41 and that he was at risk of harming himself. There was a failure to treat Mr Hamilton as a missing person at this time, a failure by the mental health services to refer him to the home treatment team for a safe and well check and he was not assessed by the street triage team. At 18.58 police were notified by his landlord that he had left his property following a mental health episode and he was reported to have drunk bleach. No action was taken in relation to this log. At 19.51 police found Mr Hamilton walking on the footpath alongside the dual carriageway near The Fort shopping village after a member of the public reported seeing a man walking in the road. Mr Hamilton reported to officers that he suffered from depression and was out walking to clear his head. Police noted that he was cold and wet and had recently been assessed at Good Hope Hospital and he agreed to be taken to Birmingham Heartlands hospital for further assessment. At the hospital he was triaged by a nurse and noted to be suicidal. He was taken to the escalation room to wait to be assessed. He was not seen again and was noted to be missing from the department at 05.28 on 05/12/21. It is not known when he left the department. There was a failure to report him missing at this time. On 06/12/21 the deceased was found by a member of the public who was walking his dog, in the middle of the river [REDACTED]  Stechford lying on his back on a rock. He was confirmed deceased at the scene by [REDACTED] at 12.20. His whereabouts since he left the emergency department on or around 4/5th December 2021 are unknown and whilst he had previously indicated suicidal ideation, his intentions at the time of his death are unknown. There were several failures in his care which amount to missed opportunities to help Mr Hamilton; however, it is not possible to say whether the outcome could have been different.
 
Following a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be:

She attended the emergency department of the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust (GEH) and was sent home with a diagnosis of migraine.   ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
(1)    The subsequent investigation by GEH highlighted two areas which needed addressing:
 
·       The need to raise awareness of subarachnoid haemorrhage masquerading as a migraine and the need to investigate possible neurological findings. This had been done by means of discussions in meetings and a poster displayed in a staff area.
·       Doctors were not familiar with the Royal College Guidance that there is a need to discuss with a consultant, all patients who unexpectedly return within 72 hours of discharge from the emergency department This had been done by circulating an aide memoire to be given to those in training and existing members of the department.
 
(2)    It was stated that the middle grade doctor who discharged Carol at her second attendance on 28 April 2022 was trained at a reputable institute overseas where Royal College guidance was not applicable. He had undergone a significant period of training and familiarisation and assessment at GEH, but it was not clear as to the way in which his understanding and appreciation of the appropriate guidelines had been assessed.
 
(3)    The document (described as an aide memoire) which notified all doctors of the Royal College Guidance referred to other matters such as punctuality and staff sick leave. Matters critical to patient care were not clearly identified and given appropriate prominence.
 
(4)    It did not appear that all doctors would have been present at meetings where the learning points were discussed.
 
(5)    The evidence made it clear that the individuals concerned had subsequently undergone appropriate training and reflection to avoid any recurrence. However, it was less clear how either learning point identified would be embedded in the team as a whole and conveyed to new members joining the team, particularly those joining the team at a more senior level, who would not previously have operated within the guidelines.
 
(6)    Although staff members would have the opportunity of accessing the material, there did not appear to be any checks to ensure that staff members had considered and understood the material provided.
 
 
(7)    It is requested that consideration be given to ensuring that where learning points relating to patient safety are identified, they are not only circulated to existing and future members of the team but that all doctors confirm their understanding and compliance.
 
(8)    It is also requested that there is a review of training plans for more senior doctors who would not be familiar with Royal College and other guidelines, to ensure that guidance critical to patient safety is easily identified and that familiarity with any
such guidance is assessed.","On 10 May 2022, the senior coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Carol Ann Welch aged 47.

(3)              The Forensic Collision Investigator indicated that she had been unable to find any research or scientific data on why such incidents occur.
(4)              It was adduced in evidence that a kite safety mark may be checked by an instructor during motor cycle courses/tests but there did not appear to be a known check for ensuring a person has the correct size motorcycle helmet.
(5)              It was acknowledged that many people may now purchase motorcycle helmets over the internet and the sizing and fitting may not be appropriate.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
There was a failure at Hull Royal Infirmary to understand the process of implementing Section 5(2) of the Mental Health act 1983 [MHA] (Doctors Holding Power) as well as general uncertainty about its significance and effect. Mollie absconded from the ward whilst apparently under this section. The paperwork for the implementation of this section of the MHA 1983 was in fact not properly completed and hence invalid. Whilst the Hull & East Yorkshire NHS Trust has taken steps to educate doctors about this power, these were only local measures and I believe that all doctors working in England and Wales should be aware of section 5(2) and nurses of their equivalent power pursuant to section 5(4) of the MHA 1983 and that appropriate awareness and training should be given.","On 12th July 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mollie Rose Stansfield, age 22 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 9th December 2022. ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you as Chief executive of NHS England have the power to take such action.
 
Training and highlighting of this important power should be regularly delivered to all doctors and nurses about their respective holding powers.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 13th February 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. (HEALTHCARE) Lack of safe system, supported by training, guidance, and compliance auditing, for the provision of physical healthcare assessment and monitoring by NEWS2 for acutely unwell patients in a secure setting.
 
The Jury found shortcomings in the healthcare afforded to Alex at HMP Nottingham in the form of “continuous failures to provide adequate healthcare, which probably more than minimally contributed to his death“.
 
I heard evidence that staff were not consistently assessing acutely unwell patients using the NEWS2 system, despite the scoring system having been adopted across the NHS over the past decade and having been adopted by this Trust many years prior.
 
In 2017, when relaunching the NEWS system, the Royal College of Physicians noted,
“Every so often, someone comes up with an idea that is so obvious, no one can understand why it wasn’t thought of before. I am proud that the RCP’s National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is one of those initiatives – not just a chart (or iPad) at the end of the bed to record the patient’s physical signs and symptoms, but the chart at the end of the bed – a single point of truth to unify recording of symptoms across the NHS, consolidate training for doctors and nurses in the recording of symptoms, and thereby improve patient safety. When the RCP launched the NEWS in 2012, we hoped to see the score adopted across the NHS. What has been more astonishing is the adoption of the score internationally, with requests to use NEWS coming from health services across the world from Europe to India and the USA, including the US Naval Air Forces!“
 
I heard evidence of an inconsistent application of NEWS2 by staff, an inconsistent awareness of NEWS2 across the staff body, and an absence of clear and robust training supported by guidance, ensuring staff were aware of the expectations of their employer with regards to the use of NEWS2 in monitoring acutely unwell patients.
 
Sadly, Alex’s is not an isolated case. I have been repeatedly assured at a senior level from Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that they are seeking to embed NEWS2 across their Directorates, yet successive inquests have heard of patients failed by the lack of use of the system by the clinical staff responsible for their medical care. If this issue is not addressed across the Trust, with sufficient urgency, patients will continue to die in Trust settings due to a failure to recognise the
deteriorating patient, and to arrange for timely healthcare intervention.","On 06 April 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Alexander Michael BRAUND, aged 25.  The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, conducted before a Jury, on 30 November 2022.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 14, 2023.
