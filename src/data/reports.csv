27/11/2023,2023-0482,Barbara Rymell,Samantha Marsh,Somerset,Care Home Health related deaths,Home Office | Department of Health and Social Care,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/barbara-rymell-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Barbara-Rymell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0482_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/2023-0482-Response-from-Home-Office.pdf,"Barbara became a resident of Ashley House Residential Home in Langport (“Ashley House”) on the 8th August 2022. She took up residency on discharge from hospital where she had had an inpatient stay as a result of a fall in the community.
 
On becoming a resident of Ashley House Barbara had a known diagnosis of dementia, which sometimes affected her memory. She was at a high risk of falling and had blurred vision. All in all, she was a relatively frail elderly woman with known risks around her mobility and she relied on others to keep her safe.
 
Barbara was the only resident with a bedroom on the first floor of Ashley House. This could only be accessed via the stairs (which Barbara was incapable of ascending or descending safely) or the mechanically operated stairlift (which Barbara was not permitted to use unattended or unsupervised.)
 
On the evening of the 8th of August 2022 two carers were on duty; neither of whom were native English speaking nationals; one was Romanian and the other was Indian.
 
I was told that in order to be able to work in the UK, those requiring a Visa (as the two carers on duty did) must prove that they can read, write, speak and understand English to at least Level B1…. [that they must demonstrate that they] can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work”. Applicants for a Visa must have passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT).
 
It transpired during the Inquest that one of the workers on the evening of the 8th August 2022 had never passed the SELT, so was not qualified or permitted to work in the UK.
 
At 19:27 one of the carers called 999 to request an ambulance. It was clear, on the evidence, that Barbara had been left unattended on the mechanical chair for around five minutes. This was clearly contrary to the rules and procedures of Ashley House. During those five minutes she has left the seat of the mechanically operated stairlift (possibly unfastening the seat belt) and proceeded to climb the stairs; which she was unable to safely, due to do physical limitations and her underlying cognitive impairment.
 
She has fallen on the stairs, falling downwards. There were no witnesses to this incident but Barbara has been found, having fallen awkwardly, landing with her head trapped under the chair for the mechanically operated stairlift. Care staff were unable to free her because of the positioning and angle at which she was entrapped within the mechanics.
 
On calling 999 (copies of both recordings were played at the Inquest) it was obvious that neither of the care staff were sufficiently proficient in English to be able to:
Explain clearly the nature of the medical emergency. An internal audit by the ambulance service revealed that the call-handler had selected an incorrect pathway. The correct pathway that should have been selected was “entrapment” but at no time during the call did the carer give any
information that would have indicated that this was the presenting problem. The carer repeated used the word “blocked” which added no assistance, clarity of explanation of the events that were unfolding.
 
Understand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing”. This made any meaningful triage of Barbara’s condition virtually impossible. The call handler followed the script to ask if the patient was conscious and breathing (i.e. to ascertain clinical emergency and determination of a priority response) but this assessment was severely hampered given the carer did not appear to know or understand the difference between bleeding and breathing.
 
Understand the difference between “alert” and “alive”, which presented all of the same problems as referred in in (ii) above.
 
Paramedics arrived on a category 2 response and, on arrival, it was clear that Barbara was beyond medical help. She was pronounced deceased at the scene.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
I am concerned that those working with vulnerable people who are in a position of trust and responsibility must be able to demonstrate a sufficient proficiency in English to enable to summon appropriate emergency medical attention when needed. Vulnerable people, by very definition, are unable to often appreciate the need for help; take steps to keep themselves safe and/or summon help for themselves when they need it.
 
By being unable to speak the native language of England with any proficiency I am concerned that deaths will continue to arise where those who are young, disabled, suffering from a mental impairment or who are elderly and in need of urgent medical help will not have this summoned for them if those who are engaging with emergency professionals are unable to communicate effectively.
 
The Court looked at evidence of the B1 English test. Examples from the paper were as follows:
“I                      that book last year” (options are bought, have bought, had bought)
“The town,                  is very beautiful, has lots of parks” (options are which, where, what).
This level of comprehension is comparable to a KS2 curriculum being studied by Year 6 students sitting their SATS exam and appears to be wholly insufficient for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people, as demonstrated in this case by carers who were alone (i.e. no English speaking members of staff on duty) being unable to explain to medical professionals the presenting condition of the patient.","On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Jean Rymell, aged 91 (“Barbara”). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 21st of November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was death by Misadventure.

He underwent an endoscopy on 18 August 2022 where biopsies were taken. The results showed abnormal cells. On 15 September, Mr Di Blasi was referred by a GP to the Lower Gastro-intestinal team for possible bowel cancer and had a CT scan on 4 November 2022. The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the
report until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022. The incidental findings were not considered to be ‘significant’ by the Radiologists and were not therefore warrant an alert being sent to the referring clinician, leaving the report to be reviewed when they were able to. My investigation revealed that the timeframe for seeing patients on the cancer referral pathway is the date of the first appointment and there are no other target dates in respect of investigations of subsequent treatment.
 
Mr Di Blasi underwent a further endoscopy on 30 November 2022. The Endoscopist was unaware of these incidental findings. A biopsy was taken from an area which looked abnormal but was actually a gastric varix. As a result of this, Mr Di Blasi suffered a massive bleed and despite maximal supportive measures, he died on 1 December 2022 at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8HW.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
(1)  That one of the teams caring for Mr Di Blasi was completely unaware of the input from another specialty team, despite both referrals being made under the 2-week urgent referral pathway. The lack of communication between these teams meant that timely sharing of results did not occur. Even the very knowledge of the fact that a CT scan had taken place would have alerted the endoscopist to check those results, and it is likely that the second endoscopy would not have gone ahead. I understand this to be a national issue and is likely to apply to other investigations being carried out.
 
(2)  That the reporting timeframes on the 2-week urgent cancer pathway referral does not take into account timeframes for reporting investigative procedures or subsequent review by the referring clinicians.
 
(3)  The current training for Endoscopists for JAG certification requires the performance
of 200 endoscopies. However, these tend to focus on the clinician’s area of specialty and therefore there is a danger that lesion recognition will be limited and insufficient to ensure that endoscopists are able to recognise less frequently occurring lesions. With the need for an increasing number of endoscopists, action should be taken.","On 13th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Calogero Di Blasi. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was:   ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, the Secretary of State for Health, have the power to take such action, and that University Hospitals Bristol & Weston also have the power to take such action on a local level.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10 January 2024.

He was 79 years old. He had fallen the morning before, at home, and had remained on the floor until admittance to the ED at approximately 05:32 on the 20th December 2022. He had made a first call to the East of England Ambulance Service at around 7:29 pm on the 19th December 2022. The call was allocated a C2 category which aims to have an urgent response within an 18 minute time frame. The EEAS was extremely busy that night with previously unseen levels of C2 allocations of ambulances. In addition, the hospitals in the area were queuing ambulances outside ED’s because they were unable to offload patients and then proceed to other calls. That combination meant that despite being allocated an urgent response time Mr Vincent was effectively left on the floor for a very prolonged time. Ultimately he had a cardiac arrest at home and an ambulance attended promptly. He was resuscitated but the “down time” was prolonged. He died as a result of a combination of an undiagnosed bronchopneumonia complicated by severe coronary artery disease and a long lie. On the balance of probabilities it is likely that had he been admitted at the time of the first call he would not have died at the time he did.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Mr Vincent had fallen many hours prior to making his first call to the ambulance service. There then followed a further ten hour delay, during which time he had a cardiac arrest, before he was admitted to the Emergency Department. He had been allocated an appropriate response time, expected within 18 minutes at 1929 on the 19th December 2022. For the reasons given in the circumstances above, that target was missed by an enormous margin. There is a strong possibility, even arguably a probability that another frail, elderly individual, will have the same experience. Long lie after a fall, especially in the elderly often results in a terminal kidney injury and death. Consideration should be given to review of how these types of emergency call are managed and thereafter monitored.","On 09 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John VINCENT aged 79.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Whilst the jury did not make any finding of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in this case, much evidence was heard about the training in identification of the signs and symptoms. National training of police officers on the identification of ABD is focused on a triad of warning flags being, hot to touch, exhibiting constant or near constant activity and extreme agitation or aggression. Some evidence identified that Carl Fullalove did not exhibit these triad symptoms but did exhibit other nuanced symptoms in the long list delivered in training. It was evident that his symptoms were not recognised as ABD due to drug intoxication, and that the consequential risks associated with prone restraint were not therefore considered. Prone restraint ultimately led to his death. There were six experts providing evidence to the inquest two of whom identified that Carl would not have died had he been recognised as unwell at the point of arrest and assessed by a health care practitioner. Such attention would have provided a calming intervention for his heart rate and breathing prior to being placed in prone restraint, which exerted additional pressure on his ability to breath freely.
 
A research paper before the inquest, namely ‘Consensus on Acute Behavioural Disturbance in the UK, September 2023 recommends that the focus remain on the triad of warning signs. ABD is clearly difficult to distinguish from drug intoxication by a non-medical practitioner. The rigidity of the training with focus on specific symptoms can cause police officers to miss other signs. The Superintendent, and head of ‘Protecting Vulnerable People’ for Cheshire accepted that with hindsight the use of prone restraint was inadvisable in this case.
 
Significant training on ABD had been delivered by Cheshire Constabulary through the College of Policing Personal Safety Training package module, the key to which was to identify an underlying medical condition to refer to a health care practitioner. That may be a lot to expect of police officers in a dynamic fast paced setting. The use of the term ABD may be a distraction.
 
The effect of stimulant drugs and the need for calming de-escalation in an upright position, rather than prone restraint, had not been noted in either the training material or the research paper presented to the Court. This is on the background of recognising from College of Policing guidance that a high percentage of deaths in prone restraint are in drug related cases.
 
The First Aid Learning Programme (FALP) will be in place within Forces by April 2024 and includes amongst other things positional asphyxia, unconscious and not breathing, and ABD but does not mention training in calming intervention that on balance of probabilities may have led to a different outcome in this case.","On 04 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carl FULLALOVE aged 29.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1.     The concerns within the hospital and non-compliance with the LRCP protocol has been addressed by way of an investigation & action plan.
 
2.     The nurse at the practice told the Inquest, the procedure for practice staff calling 999 (not leaving it to the patient) in the event of a patient with chest pain and other life threatening conditions applied only to reception staff and not to nursing staff. This led to inconsistency and in this case an avoidable delay in summoning urgent medical assistance and needs reviewing/all staff working in/working on behalf of the practice need to be aware of the procedure to be followed, consideration must be given as to whether it is appropriate to have different standards for qualified nursing and administrative/non qualified nursing staff. The awareness of Dissecting Aortic Aneurysm and the rapidity at which the condition can become catastrophic/fatal also needs raising within the practice.
 
The nurse within the practice who spoke with Wayne on the date of his death on behalf of the practice , did not escalate to a doctor, did not call 999, she did not inform the NOK of her concerns, she did not call back to see if Wayne had called for an ambulance/attended hospital and she did not alert the hospital of her suspicions

Background
·       I heard evidence that when Ms GARLAND was on the Cardiac High Dependency Unit ‘HDU’ (part of the Intensive Care Unit) she was receiving intravenous antibiotics
·       When she then transferred from HDU to the Cardiac Ward there was a transcription error, and these antibiotics were accidentally omitted from the list of medications that she should be given on the new ward
·       As a result Ms GARLAND’s antibiotics were discontinued accidentally
·       I heard (and accepted) evidence that it would have been reasonable to discontinue antibiotics in any event at the time of Ms GARLAND’s transfer
·       Notwithstanding that fact, I remain deeply concerned by the circumstances in which the error took place
My concerns
 
·       I heard evidence from an ICU Consultant (who I found to be both a reliable and an impressive witness), who told me, among other things, that:
–        “… Transcription errors have always been a problem…” the ideal way to get rid of them would be to have a system [in the rest of the hospital] that speaks to ours
–        The ICU retains lists of its patients’ medication on a computerised/electronic system
–        The rest of the wards in the hospital do not operate the same system
–        The available systems do not speak to each other (to put it in somewhat colloquial terms)
–        Efforts to address that problem have proved fruitless
–        As a result, every time an inpatient moves from ICU to another department in the hospital, an appropriately qualified member of staff has to physically transcribe that patient’s medication list
–        With (for instance) 10 patients moving per day, 15-20 medications per patient, and multiple elements for each medication (name; dose; timing; indication; start date; signature etc.), “at a conservative estimate 1,500 to 2,000 elements [are transcribed] daily”
(Coroner’s comment: for obvious reasons this creates enormous potential for human error)
–        There are a limited number of people who can prescribe (and are therefore
able to perform this task); in critical care they are the same people who are responsible for providing care
–        “We really need a second check… funding for more pharmacists… as a Trust we’ve fallen short of ICU national standards for years in terms of the number of pharmacists per bed and medicines reconciliation”
–        “I spoke to the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer – he has submitted 5 proposals in the last 7 years to try to get the deficit funded… [without success]”
 
In summary, my view is that the circumstances currently in place create a very real (and known) risk that transcription errors will continue to occur. This in turn endangers patients, and creates a risk that people will die in the future as a result of such errors.
 
It is, sadly, very easy to envisage circumstances in which a patient might not receive essential medication at all, might receive the wrong dose of the medication they need, or might receive the wrong medication altogether, because of a transcription error.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.","On 31 October 2022 an investigation commenced into the death of Ms Cherry Lynne GARLAND, aged 77.

·      This inquest was about a man who, aged 90, died whilst waiting to be seen by  a medical professional in hospital. He did not simply arrive at hospital,  but   had been assessed and then sent there by his GP, who felt, rightly as it turned out, that Derek may have developed an obstruction. He was anticipating   Derek would be seen quickly.
 
·      He arrived at the Emergency Department, and handed in some paperwork at reception and understandably expected he would not have to wait long to be assessed by doctors who he knew were expecting him.
 
·      No-one called for him for almost two hours by which time he had died.
 
·      It is correct to say that once a post mortem examination was performed, it was clear that even if he had been assessed immediately upon arrival at hospital his condition was such that surgical intervention was not a realistic possibility and the condition was going to prove terminal.
 
·      At the time Derek arrived, as the Hospital Trust’s own internal review of this death explained, such were the pressures on the hospital Trust posed by patient numbers that it was operating at OPEL [Operations Pressure Escalation Level] 4. This is a method used by the NHS to measure the stress, demands, and pressure a hospital is under. OPEL 4 represents the highest level, when a hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient
safety is at risk”.","During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
·      Concern 1 – that the medical professionals who work in a hospital emergency department are routinely expected to do so when the OPEL 4 applies, a recognition they are performing their roles when the hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient safety is at risk”. Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.
 
·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for. There is a clear risk that puts patients at risk and it would be remiss of me not to raise it.
 
·      Concern 3 – Finally, it is relevant to point out that Derek had not moved for    some time before a medical professional called for Derek.  I  formed the  view that there had been a reluctance on his Friend’s part to request assistance due   to the pressures staff were clearly under, but also because he had already  handed in Derek’s paperwork and was expecting some assistance imminently which did not arrive. I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures.","The death of Harold Derek PEDLEY Otherwise known as Derek PEDLEY on 21.12.22 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th August 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

He had owned his plane, a Cap- 10-B since 2014. He had a current and valid private pilot’s licence which permitted him to fly under Visual Flight Rules (“VFR”). Mr Mann did not possess the skills, experience of ability to fly in cloud; he could only fly in clear skies as he was unable to “instrument fly” and could only fly by reference to what he could see out of the window.
 
His passenger on the day, Mrs Costa, had no flying experience and did not possess a pilot’s licence. She had no active part in the events that unfolded.
 
On 12th August 2021 at 08:04 Mr Mann took off from Watchford Farm, Yarcombe near Taunton, Somerset with Mrs Costa on a planned pleasure trip for the day to the Isle of Sicily. There was no evidence that Mr Mann had used recognised aviation sources to check the weather prior to departure, instead obtaining weather information from news weather-based apps.
 
At around 09:10 the weather conditions deteriorated and so Mr Mann turned back. At around 10:10 found himself at an altitude of 7,500ft flying above cloud, He was not qualified to fly through cloud. He contacted the Distress and Diversion Cell (“D&D Cell”) on the emergency frequency for assistance.
 
Mr Mann began to descend to a lower altitude but he appears to have become spatially disorientated due to the extreme stress of flying in the weather conditions in which he found himself and when he emerged from cloud, the ground was not where he expected it to be. The plane collided with a large oak tree at Lower Colley Farm, Buckland St Mary near Chard, Somerset and was destroyed on impact with both the pilot and passenger being thrown from the wreckage and suffering catastrophic injuries that were incompatible with life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

(i)   the pilot’s capabilities (i.e that he could not instrument fly and/or fly in cloud);
(ii)   the plane’s capabilities (i.e. that it was not equipped to allow the pilot to instrument fly)
(iii)   the weather conditions at the selected diversion aerodrome (to ensure that the weather was more favourable to the conditions at the home aerodrome).
 
Checklists and aide memoires were not used by those on the ground and, consequently, there was a lack of knowledge and/or appreciation of the unsuitability of the selected airport (Exeter) as a viable diversion destination;

He had also undergone amputations of his toes due to non-healing diabetic ulcers.  
 
His daughter, said in evidence that he was admitted to hospital on 30th   May 2022 following a fall at home. He said that he’d fallen forward and onto his knee. He was lifted from the floor and onto his bed by his family where he remained until an ambulance was called, when the decision was taken to admit him to the Royal United Hosptial (the RUH) in Bath.  
 
He was admitted via the Emergency department, then to the medical assessment unit (MAU), and then onto the Orthopaedic ward – Pierce Ward on 1st  June 2022 in the early hours.  
 
According to the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mr Nippard was initially admitted, with the diagnosis of right knee septic arthritis and an acute kidney injury on top of his chronic kidney disease. Mr Nippard was on antibiotics and on 2nd   June 2022 underwent a washout of his knee. On 8th   June he had a second washout. By 17th   June he was deteriorating, on 20th   June his CRP was increasing. He said in his evidence that the pressure sore was first documented by the orthopaedic team on 21stJune, the surgeon described this now as – the bigger source of infection.  
 
An MRI was requested but did not take place for 4 days; it was undertaken on 25th June and reported as showing no obvious sacral osteomyelitis it did show that it had locally spread in the soft tissue.  
 
By 28th June Mr Nippard was getting worse, his inflammatory markers were going up and now his testicles were swollen, and there was a suspicion was that this was Fournier’s Gangrene and there was a referral made to the Urology team. 
   
The orthopaedic surgeon said that as far as the treatment for Mr Nippard’s knee went, he felt they were winning that it was improving that if he hadn’t developed the pressure sore his expectation was that he would have been discharged. He agreed with the medical cause of death proposed.  
 
A Consultant Urologist examined Mr Nippard on 28th June, he said that he had evidence of a significant infection, that the only treatment was surgery, and all agreed that surgery was not likely to help, and it would cause Mr Nippard immense suffering in his last days. He explained that the other medical conditions Mr Nippard suffered with caused him to be compromised, if he’d had a stronger heart and kidneys then they would have operated 
 
Sadly, after discussions with Urologists, Surgeons, Anesthetists and the Critical care team it was decided that Mr Nippard was not fit for surgery, and he was placed on priorities of care and died on 6th   July 2022. 
 
It was the view of the doctors who attended the inquest and gave evidence that the pressure sore significantly contributed to Mr Nippard’s death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

His mother was attended by paramedics, but really what she needed was early hospital obstetric care.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
That Phoenix’ death was and remains utterly devastating for his parents is unsurprising. However, it was clear at inquest that it was also deeply shocking for those trying to care for him and his mum. Events were outside the experience of several of the healthcare professionals involved.
 
I heard at inquest that new national maternity guidance is to be published at the end of the month. This will include within it revised advice for paramedics faced with an unplanned home delivery such as this one to transport to hospital even if birth is imminent. I was assured at inquest that the advice will quickly be disseminated.
 
Had I not been given this information, I would have made a prevention of future deaths report to the ambulance service.
 
It is of course of the utmost importance that hospital clinicians and ambulance clinicians have the same understanding of how a patient in any given situation should be treated, and I have copied this report to the London Ambulance Service (LAS).
 
The reason I make a report to the Homerton, is because it seemed to me at inquest that there were two matters that had not yet been resolved.
 
i)  At inquest, there was not a shared understanding among the clinicians within the trust about how such a situation should be approached.
 
The obstetricians were clear that, given her very high risk status, Phoenix’ mum needed to come in to hospital as soon as she showed the first signs of labour. And even if she had started to deliver, she could still only be treated effectively and Phoenix given the best chance of a good outcome in hospital.","On 3 August 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Phoenix Chapman, a baby who died less than six weeks after he was born. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 July 2023. I made a determination at inquest of death by natural causes.   ","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11 September 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.
 
Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action.

11/07/2023,2023-0242,John James,Nadia Persaud,East London,Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths,Barts Health NHS Foundation Trust,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/john-james-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/John-James-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0242_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023-0242-Response-from-Bart-Health-NHS-Trust-1.pdf,"Mr. James was admitted to Whipps Cross Hospital on the 13 October 2022 and was found to be suffering from malnutrition and a bowel obstruction (later discovered to be due to an adenocarcinoma). He underwent surgery on 18 October 2022 to remove the tumour. This was surgically uneventful. Post-operatively, he required a lengthy period of intensive care. On the 19 December 2022 he was stepped down from intensive care to a ward. He was at a very high risk of developing a thromboembolism due to his cancer diagnosis, recent surgery, lengthy period in hospital and immobility. During the period of 9 to 15 January 2023 he refused his anti- coagulation medication on three occasions. The reason for refusal is unclear and there is no documented evidence that the risk of non-compliance with the medication was explained to him or escalated to the medical team. On the 20 January 2023, Mr. James suffered from an acute deterioration in his health, culminating in a cardiac arrest. He passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on the 21 January 2023 from a pulmonary embolism. The missing doses of anticoagulation during the two weeks leading up to his death is likely to have contributed to a degree, to the development of the pulmonary embolism.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The refusal of anti-coagulation medication was not brought to the attention of medical staff. The administration of anti-coagulation medication to patients like Mr James, is vital for reducing the risk of a venous thrombo-embolism, a potentially life-threatening condition. There is no electronic prompt/alert to highlight to the medical team when prescribed anticoagulation medication is not administered.
 
The Trust’s internal investigator recognised that a fail-safe should be put in place within the electronic records, to ensure escalation to the medical team where doses of prescribed anti- coagulation are not administered. Such a measure could prevent similar deaths from occurring. It was considered that this measure could assist in preventing future deaths not just locally, but at a wider level.","On 16 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr John Michael James. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 6 July 2023.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:
 
1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.
 
2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.
 
3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.
 
4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.
 
5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.
 
6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.
 
7.  Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.
 
8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.
 
9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.
 
10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.
 
The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.","On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021 [REDACTED].
 
The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.
 
I made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:
 
1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.
 
2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.
 
3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.
 
4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.
 
5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.
 
6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.
 
7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.
 
8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.
 
9.  At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased’s home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4th August 2023.

When his penultimate placement broke down, he was placed by London Borough of Islington in an unregulated residential home, 23 Gledwood Gardens run by Urban Youth Flex during 2016. He was 18 years of age. Several weeks later, another resident, referred to as “the assailant” also 18 years old was placed in the same accommodation as an emergency. 11 days after they were placed together, the assailant fatally stabbed Lance Scott Walker.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1 Response requested from Secretary of State for Education and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
Lance was only exposed to his killer because he was obliged to live in the designated accommodation. Although the 2 relevant Councils were duty bound to house both individuals up until the age of 21 under the Leaving Care Act, there is currently no regulation for the over 18’s. Regulation is being introduced for 16- 17 year olds in April 2023.
 
Both Councils were in agreement that Regulation of this sector would be welcomed to support them in carrying out their statutory obligations . A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC’s regulation as the provision is not for “care” but support. The provision is made from an entirely un-regulated sector, resulting in some organisations offering accommodation with inadequate training, staffing or knowledge to meet the complex needs of some of our most vulnerable individuals. Consideration should be given to introducing regulation for at least 18-21 year old individuals. This issue remains a concern for all those who work within it.","On 17 July 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lance Scott Walker, age 18 . The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report , namely by 13 March 2023.
