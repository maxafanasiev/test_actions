He was moved to M wing on 16.01.21.He was placed in a single cell and appeared settled and was part of the daily cleaning crew.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Consideration should be given to the review of the treatment, monitoring and management of patients with a history of epilepsy or seizures by both the prison staff and healthcare staff. In particular, there was no seizure care plan, no seizure diary and once the ACCT had closed on 10th March 2021, there was no formal mechanism of monitoring Trevor’s condition. Further, the ACCT is not a suitable mechanism for such monitoring. The CSRA policy is designed to protect other prisoners, but not those who suffer from medical conditions as Trevor suffered. PPG in their evidence to be considered relating to PFD matters state that a care plan dashboard is now in place at HMP Lewes but this does not appear to be individualized or tailored to the prisoner’s clinical requirements.
 
Communication between healthcare and prison staff especially when Trevor was returned to the wing, between the prison staff and family, briefing by prison managers to officers on the wing about Trevor’s condition were all inadequate.
 
Evidence was heard about the lack of integration of various IT systems which contributed to poor communication. In spite of the evidence from PPG regarding the sensitivity of medical records which should not be disclosed to the prison staff, I remain concerned that there was no effective monitoring and management of Trevor on the wing once the ACCT was closed. There was no mechanism in place for prison and healthcare staff to report their concerns about Trevor’s non compliance with taking his medication to Security, thus preventing the cell from being searched for retained medication.
 
There was a lack of training of prison staff in dealing with long term health conditions such as epilepsy on the wings. I understand there is a deficit in national policy within the prison service to manage and support prisoners with epilepsy and seizures.","On 22 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Trevor Alan MONERVILLE aged 33.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 September 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 07, 2024.

Her separation anxiety had become so severe that it also began to impact her husband and his ability to leave her alone for any significant length of time and carry out his own work. She saw her GP on 16 and 30 June, and on 30 June she was referred to the Crisis Response Team. On both 5 and 8 July, she left a note for her family and took a taxi to a train station and multi-storey car park respectively. On each of those occasions, Nadia was found by police and taken to hospital. From 10 July she received specialist in-patient care at the Peter Bruff Unit, before being discharged home on 17 July under the care of the Crisis Home Treatment Team, who attended upon her either in person or virtually until 25 July. From 23 July she began to reach out to other professional colleagues (she had been a counsellor herself) via text message and email and made desperate pleas for help, to such an extent that one of these professionals called the police. On 26 July she recorded a video message for her daughter and left a handwritten note for her husband and daughter. She took sleeping tablets and appeared to have drunk some wine as well. When her husband returned home that evening, he found her hanging [REDACTED]. A post-mortem examination confirmed the medical cause of death to be; 1a Hanging.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
Failure to update Nadia’s records with the outcomes of referrals that were made and whether such referrals were accepted or declined, either for Nadia or her carer.
Failure to include within her records considerations and professional opinions reached on the prospect, or not, of readmission for in-patient treatment together with the final decision and rationale.
Lack of bespoke care plans tailored to Nadia’s needs. Notwithstanding the fact Nadia had begun to disengage and declined to be involved in her care planning, more personalised plans could have been drafted taking into account her personal characteristics, needs and past medical history.
Evidence of “cutting and pasting” into Nadia’s care plan from another patient’s care plan.
Failing to undertake risk assessments at all relevant and appropriate stages and/or failure to record that such an assessment had in fact taken place and what the outcome was.
Failing to provide a “RAG” rating to risk assessments and/or to indicate where required that a risk exists.
Failure to include risk management and contingency planning within Nadia’s care plans as well as key elements of her condition at that time, including her recent inpatient admission.
The potential for over-reliance on Nadia’s husband, albeit he was only too willing to support her and care for her, and the need to balance maintaining Nadia’s care and treatment in the community with the need to support her carer as well.","On 4 August 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nadia Wyatt, 53.

12/01/2024,2024-0023,Iona Buckingham,Jonathan Dixey,Northamptonshire,Child Death (from 2015) | Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths,Northampton General Hospitals NHS Trust | NHS Northamptonshire Integrated Care Board | NHS England,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/iona-buckingham-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Iona-Buckingham-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2024-0023_Published.pdf,,"On 28 November 2022 Iona Buckingham was admitted to the Northampton General Hospital for oxygen therapy and feeding support in view of a diagnosis of bronchiolitis. A chest x-ray was performed on 29 November 2022 which showed right upper lobe pneumonia and some pleural effusion. Iona was escalated from high-flow nasal cannula oxygen to continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”).   Iona continued to receive antibiotics and her condition appeared to improve. On 30 November 2022 she was stepped down from high-dependency care.   ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Following Iona’s death, the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust conducted a Serious Incident Investigation. One of the recommendations made by the investigation panel was:
 
“Children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should be suspected of having a pleural effusion and should get an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”
 
That recommendation reflected advice provided on 29th November 2022 (the day after Iona’s admission to Northampton General Hospital) by the East Midlands Paediatric Critical Care Network:
 
“We would like to inform you of a high number of cases of highly aggressive sepsis, linked to empyema, and positive culture for Group A Streptococcus in the region. This has caused significant morbidity and mortality.
We advise early referral, aggressive management, high dose intravenous antibiotics, and early drainage of empyemas.
Please have a low threshold for investigating any child with a secondary respiratory deterioration, especially with new onset of fever. Chest X-Ray and ultrasound will be beneficial.”
 
At the inquest into Iona’s death, I heard evidence from the Trust’s Clinical Director of the Child Health Directorate who is also a Consultant Paediatrician.
 
On the basis of the evidence I heard from the Clinical Director, I am satisfied that the Trust has taken action in respect of the recommendations made and more broadly have reflected upon the circumstances of Iona’s death. However, in respect of the recommendation set out above, I am concerned that there remains a risk that future deaths could occur unless further action is taken.
 
The recommendation made by the investigation panel was that children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should get “an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”. However, the evidence I heard suggests this is not possible.
 
I heard from the Clinical Director that as a district general hospital, Northampton General Hospital does not have access to a paediatric radiologist outside of 9am-5pm on Mondays and Fridays when such a specialist is either on duty or on-call. I heard evidence that in Iona’s case, a Consultant in ITU and Anaesthesia was able to perform an ultrasound scan at around 2pm on 4th December 2022 however this is not a facility that would routinely be available to the Trust and was not, in any event, part of that clinician’s core duties.
 
I am concerned that a very unwell child who may require a chest ultrasound may not receive one ‘immediately’ and in fact may have to wait for a considerable period of time. For example, if the need arose over a weekend, that child may not receive an ultrasound scan for up to 48 hours.","On 14th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Iona Grace Buckingham, aged 9 months.

On 27 April 2023 ducting made from rigid 180mm poly- ethylene coiled pipe was being dispensed from a coil trailer through a pre-drilled 100 meter hole. Mr Harper was stood sufficiently close to the trailer, that at the end of dispensing when the stored energy was released, it caused the unsecured tail end of the coiled pipe to spring and strike Mr Harper causing serious abdominal and chest injuries, and he died the following day. The coil trailer was supplied with a restraining clamp and strap. The operating manual for the coil trailer, and method statement and risk assessment for the work, all identified the risk of the tail end of coiled pipe springing as a consequence of stored energy, and that it should be secured to the trailer.

At 22.51PM Mr. KING’s wife called 999 and spoke with an ambulance service call handler. Following triage of the call, the response to Mr. KING’s call was graded as a Category 3 (a potentially urgent condition which is not life threatening with a target response of 120 minutes). This call was subsequently re-graded following review in the call centre at 23.18PM to a Category 2 (a potentially serious condition requiring rapid assessment, urgent on scene intervention or transport to hospital, with a response within 40 minutes and a target of 18 minutes).   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Availability of ambulances to carry out transfers in a timely manner, in urgent cases, between NHS Hospitals and in responding to 999 and 111 calls in the community.
Confusion as between ambulance and hospital staff and a lack of clarity in the purpose of and process for the categorisation of transfers (particularly in urgent situations) between NHS hospitals.
The suitability of the NHS approach to centralising exigent care in regional centres (such as the Royal Papworth Hospital for cardiac conditions) if the means to deliver such an approach are inadequate.
Adequacy of the action plan provided to the court in addressing the concern at (a) above and that of ambulance attendances to 999 and 111 calls; the plan is generalised, lacking detail and any means of measurement of progress.
 
Evidence received at Inquest identified waits for ambulance attendance of between 5-6 hours on the evening of 9th/10th December 2022. This, in circumstances where the call relating to Mr. KING had been categorised as a category 2 response. In Mr. KING’s case he was exhibiting symptoms of having suffered/was suffering a heart attack.
 
In Mr. KING’s case he had arrived at hospital been triaged, assessed and arrangements for urgent lifesaving care made by competent emergency clinicians in conjunction with experts from the regional cardiac unit. This included the requirement for an urgent transfer to the regional cardiac centre. A request for an emergency transfer from West Suffolk Hospital to The Royal Papworth Hospital was subject to further computer algorithm-based triage by the ambulance service. This resulted in a several hour delay to Mr. KING’s transfer, notwithstanding the protests from competent clinical staff in the Accident and Emergency Department at West Suffolk Hospital.
 
The circumstances of this case raise concerns about the NHS approach to centralising exigent care in regional centres (such as the Royal Papworth Hospital for cardiac conditions) if the means to deliver the approach are inadequate.
 
East of England Ambulance Service provided evidence to the Inquest, including a Report concerning its response. This plan is generalised, lacking detail and any means of measurement of progress and is inadequate in addressing the concerns raised at the Inquest.","On 20 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dennis John William KING aged 84.

05/01/2024,2024-0017,Tammy Watkins,Laurinda Bower,Nottingham and Nottinghamshire,Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths,Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/tammy-watkins-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Tammy-Watkins-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2024-0017_Published.pdf,,"Tammy Mary Louise Watkins was detained pursuant to s.45(5) of the Mental Health Act 1983 at the Women’s High Secure Service, Rampton Hospital, Nottinghamshire, when she swallowed a plastic twistable crayon (approx. 17 – 20cm in length), which perforated her bowel, causing her death on 6 June 2021. Tammy was assessed as being at high and ongoing risk of ingesting foreign objects, a risk which had materialised on many occasions prior to her death, and often lead to hospital admission. Her risk of self-harm by ingestion led to the lawful use of mechanical restraints, comprising of mittens, a bio belt, eyesight or arm’s length observations, controlled and supervised access to items when spending time out of her mittens, and a total restriction on Tammy having free access to personal items. On 22 March 2021, hospital staff provided Tammy was a twistable crayon to use while her mittens were removed. The twistable crayon had not been risk assessed or approved for use by Tammy’s MDT, who were responsible for setting her care plan. In those circumstances, the twistable crayon ought not to have been provided to her. If the crayon had been presented to the MDT, her Consultant Psychiatrist would not have approved its use as it would have posed an obvious risk of serious harm if ingested due to its size and plastic structure. Instead, alternative child-safe small wax crayons could have been used to meet the same therapeutic purpose. At this time, the Trust did not have any documented system that set out the requirements for the MDT to approve the use of risk items, but this was nevertheless an expectation on the MDT, which they failed to complete. There is no clear or consistent record of who was observing Tammy or what items she had been granted access to on 22 March 2021. Despite the crayon being noted as “missing” from the pack, no incident report was completed, nor was the Security Manager alerted or any ward level plan initiated to seek to locate the risk item. Tammy started to present with symptoms of a complication of swallowing the item the next day. She reported nausea after eating, vomiting and epigastric tenderness. Mental health staff escalated her symptoms to the physical healthcare team. Tammy reported to the Advanced Clinical Practitioner that she could feel the twistable crayon inside her. The ACP made a plan to monitor for any deterioration and to discuss with the GP the following day. She was not escalated for investigations at the local hospital despite the size of the missing item and Tammy reporting feeling it inside her.
The Trust failed to have in place a formal policy relating to the management of the ingestion of foreign bodies. This meant that staff were not all working to a clear plan of how to monitor for, detect and respond to the medical complications of ingesting foreign bodies. The MDT failed to have in place a care plan specific to Tammy’s risk of swallowing, setting out how this should be managed and escalated by ward staff. There was no continuing, co-ordinated investigation to seek to locate the twistable crayon. On the evening of 16th May 2021 Tammy was observed to be vomiting in her toilet and at the same time reaching into the toilet. When asked, Tammy reported that she had swallowed a toothbrush. An out of grounds visit was arranged to take Tammy to Bassetlaw District General hospital. Tammy was examined at Bassetlaw General Hospital and was given an x-ray at 01:33am on 17th May 2021 which did not reveal any foreign bodies. Tammy was booked for an ultrasound scan later that day but was discharged at approximately 9:30am and returned to Rampton Hospital before this could be completed.
Staff seem to have taken the negative x-ray result as evidence that there were no foreign bodies in Tammy’s system. Many staff were unaware of the limitations of x-ray in relation to non-radiopaque items or the extent of the imaging.
On the evening of 4th June 2021 Tammy reported discomfort and anxiety due to constipation. Given the timing and symptoms we feel this is likely to be the beginning of Tammy’s deterioration. No actions beyond further observations are recorded to have taken place, staff appear to have taken Tammy’s constipation entirely at face value. There is no evidence that the twistable crayon was being considered at this point.
Tammy spent most of the day of 5th June 2021 in bed due to worsening symptoms. It is recorded that a mechanical restraint review was undertaken by the duty doctor, but it is unclear whether any physical examination of Tammy was undertaken at this point.
By the evening of 5th June Tammy’s temperature and heart rate had begun to spike and mental health staff became concerned. The same duty doctor was contacted during the evening by ward staff as Tammy continued to deteriorate. The duty doctor did not attend the ward or examine Tammy and advised ward staff to provide Tammy with paracetamol. This represents a missed opportunity to have recognised the deteriorating patient and to have sought medical attention.
There is no record at this point that Tammy’s symptoms were linked in any way to foreign body ingestion, despite Tammy voicing concern that she may have perforated her bowel. Tammy’s symptoms continued to worsen throughout the early hours of 6th June 2021, including high pulse rate and temperature, anxiety, abdominal pain and vomiting, escalating to projectile vomiting and apparent ‘faecal’ vomit.
The Hospital Trust failed to adhere to the NEWS2 Policy when Tammy was acutely unwell. NEWS2 was not recorded as frequently as required, at times the readings were incomplete, and the total score was not acted upon in accordance with the policy. This led to an underestimation of Tammy’s clinical risk, and multiple missed opportunities to have rendered care in an acute hospital which would probably have prevented her death
The physical healthcare team and the on-call Duty Doctor failed to recognise Tammy was a deteriorating patient and failed to take steps to arrange her timely transfer to an acute hospital for treatment of her perforated bowel.
Over the weekend of 5-6 June 2021 there was a breakdown in communication between the ward staff, physical healthcare staff, duty doctor, and site management as to Tammy’s signs and symptoms which led to a delay in her being transported to hospital to receive treatment for her condition
Tammy continued to deteriorate throughout the morning of 6th June 2021, until shortly after 2pm when Tammy’s symptoms were recognised by the physical healthcare team to be so severe that an ambulance would be required to take Tammy to hospital. A number of miscommunications between staff, added to the lack of a clear escalation protocol for staff to follow, resulted in a delay to the ambulance being called, because staff were unclear who should call the medical emergency.","During the course of the inquest I heard evidence giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Poor Quality Acute Physical Healthcare in the mental health setting
Tammy’s death demonstrates a further example of a failure by medical staff to recognise a deteriorating patient and a subsequent delay in escalating for acute secondary care intervention.
Her death comes after repeated concerns have been raised about the quality of the Trust’s physical healthcare service in secure settings since 2018 (when Angus Bowie died from sepsis due to a perforation), in 2019 (when Christopher Howard Smith died from a pulmonary embolus), in 2020 (when Alexander Braund died from a chest infection) and in 2021 (when Michelle Louise Whitehead died from Hyponatraemic Encephalopathy).
At each of those inquests, the Trust committed to improving the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings and yet the same poor quality has prevailed in Tammy’s care.
These are examples of preventable deaths and the similarity in themes across them is exceptionally worrying.
Action needs to be taken at the most senior level to effect meaningful change to the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings at which the Trust provides services, recognising this class of patients as exceptionally vulnerable to deterioration as they are unable, either through mental health challenges and/or incarceration, to access healthcare services of their own volition.
 
Failure to Adhere to the National and Local National Early Warning Score (version 2) Policy
This is a repeated theme identified at inquest and in previous Prevention of Future Death reports. Staff remained unclear at the inquest about how frequently vital signs ought to be taken, where and how to record the values, and what action should be taken depending on the score.
 
A lack of robust policy relating to Ingestion of Foreign Bodies
I heard evidence that the Trust is in the process of drafting a policy, but it became clear during evidence that the policy is not yet sufficiently robust.
The policy needs to cover the assessment of risk when access is permitted to risk items, where such a risk assessment is stored and who is responsible for its review of content, what to do when ingestion is
suspected including how this should be managed medically and what security measures need to be taken to locate the item.
 
4. Emergency Medical Calls
There was significant confusion in this case as to who should call a medical emergency and how information should be relayed to the ambulance service. It had been recognised early in the day by the Security Team that Tammy may require an out of grounds medical transfer, but it was not until much later in the afternoon, when Tammy was in cardiac arrest, that an ambulance was called. The Security Team expected the physical healthcare team to place the call, the physical healthcare team expected the ward to place the call due to proximity to the patient.
Evidence called at the inquest established continued confusion amongst staff as to how an emergency should be managed.
 
This appears to be a training issue.","On 13 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Tammy Mary Louise WATKINS, aged 36, which concluded by inquest held before me sitting with a Jury between 9 and 20 October 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 March 2024.

She had a prolonged admission due to multiple postoperative complications requiring further surgeries. Throughout her admission she was given anticoagulant prophylaxis in the form of enoxaparin. Her clinical condition was improving and it seemed as if the cancer had been fully removed but at the time of discharge her mobility remained significantly restricted. Anticoagulant prophylaxis stopped when she left the hospital and it is unclear if ongoing indication was considered. It is more likely than not that the lack of ongoing prophylaxis led to the formation of thrombosis in her left leg and her death due to pulmonary embolism.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
[BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN]
(1) The surgical mortality review conducted after Karena’s does not seem to have considered the role that anticoagulation may have played. I understand trust guidelines suggest it continues until 5-7 days or until the patient regains full mobility. I was told many surgeons will extend this to 28 days. Karena was past the 28 day period but still had significant restriction at the time of discharge. A few years ago I heard a very similar case which occurred at a different health trust. The purpose of this report is to suggest that discharge planning might have a prompt to consider possible ongoing anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients who leave the hospital but have not yet regained full mobility.","On 16 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karena WICKINGS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . The conclusion of the inquest was

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
There was evidence that staff at Conway House were significantly concerned for Mr Cork’s welfare, which is why he was deemed as ‘at risk’. As a result of being ‘at risk’ I was told that welfare checks were required to be undertaken, at least every 24 hours. Such checks required a staff member to physically see and interact with Mr Cork or, in the alternative, to telephone him and speak to him. Welfare checks were then required to be recorded on a spreadsheet. Despite this, I was told in evidence that welfare checks would only be recorded if the resident in question was actually ‘seen’ by the staff member undertaking the check; this raises the concern that there is disparity about what constitutes a welfare check and what will or will not be recorded.
 
I heard evidence that prior to Mr Cork being found unresponsive in his room on 22 May 2023, the last recorded welfare check for Mr Cork was during the early shift of Saturday 20 May 2023. The concern here is that Mr Cork, despite being required to have welfare checks at least once every 24 hours, was not properly checked upon for between 36- 48 hours prior to his death.
 
A night project worker at Conway House told me in evidence that they had opened Mr Cork’s door at about 20:35 on Sunday 21 May 2023, but did not enter the room to see or assess Mr Cork. The only reason for opening the door appears to have been the arrival of the ‘EMS team’ who were required to check that Mr Cork was at home for the purposes of conditions imposed by the criminal justice system.
 
Having heard what they believed to be snoring, the staff member closed the door and left. This fact was verified by Metropolitan Police Officers who checked CCTV footage as part of their initial investigation following Mr Cork’s death. The concern here is that staff made assumptions that the ‘snoring’ noise was coming from Cork’s room and not an adjoining room, and that the noise was snoring, without investigating further. This was a missed opportunity to properly check on Mr Cork’s welfare, as required.
 
In evidence, I was taken through the spreadsheet that is used to record all checks and/or welfare checks required for any residents of Conway House. The record system appears to have been a basic Microsoft Excel spreadsheet devised by staff. I was told that the computer and/or spreadsheet often ‘crashed’, which led to data sometimes not being able to be recorded. I also observed that some fields of the spreadsheet were often left blank. Staff undertaking and recording checks regularly appeared not to input their name(s) or the time at which checks were undertaken. I was also told that while there was some training on how to undertake and record welfare checks, this was not needed because it was a simple task.
 
The concern here is that the recording system for welfare checks may not be adequate and that the approach taken to filling in the data required on the spreadsheet varied from one staff member to another, which may also indicate that there is a training need.
 
I was told in evidence that the same spreadsheet is still used to record any checks and/or welfare checks required for residents. I was told that the issues identified with a lack of checks for Mr Cork were caused by the fact that there were a significant number of agency staff on duty and that Conway House no longer uses agency staff. However, the staff member that opened Mr Cork’s door at 20:35 (without entering the room or seeing Mr Cork) on 21 May 2023 and subsequently found him unresponsive on the morning of 22 May 2023 was a substantive member of staff.
 
I was not reassured that any proper investigation into these issues had been undertaken or that any action(s) required to bring about improvements in the system of undertaking and recording welfare checks have been identified and/or implemented.","On 15 June 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of NICHOLAS CORK, then aged 57 years.

The provision to Ms. MITCHELL of 28 days’ worth of prescribed medication in less than a 48-hour period (14 days’ worth of medication dispensed on each occasion she was discharged hospital on the 3rd and 4th of August 2022). This occurred at a time when, due to concerns about Ms. MITCHELL hoarding medication and taking an overdose, she was receiving weekly medication prescriptions from her GP to control this risk.

She sustained multiple injuries incompatible with life. At the time she was under the care of Oxleas NHS Trust Adults’ Community Mental Health Team. She believed she had early onset dementia which was being investigated. She had poor sleep and low mood in the months prior to her death but there was no formal diagnosis for her mental condition at the time of her death.","British Transport Police made a referral to the Older Adult Community Mental Health Team, Oxleas NHS Trust, on 25th January 2023, following an incident at Hither Green Station, when Mrs Porter had attempted to end her life by standing in front of an incoming train, which stopped.
 
The 9 page referral included information that Mrs Porter: “…made a deliberate act to jump onto the tracks in front of a train” and “Q: In your opinion, due to proximity of lethal means if it hadn’t been for certain actions would death or serious harm have occurred? A:Yes”. The summary of the incident on page 4, was only partially complete, in that it did not include the information that the train had stopped. It stated she: “decided to jump down on to the tracks to take her own life but then changed her mind and came back onto the platform”.
 
The inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report, prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust Staff relied on the summary of the incident, both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for example the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police).
 
The Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to Mrs Porter. Their Report stated: “Had the referral from BTP to OACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of the incident on 25 January 2023, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been  determined as high, and a more robust plan of care implemented to mitigate against these risks, that would have been immediately shared with her family”. It was established at Inquest that had the full details of the incident on 25th January 2023 been understood – ie that Denise intended to take her life and this was only prevented by the slowing and halting of the train – that the psychiatrist would have referred her either to the Intensive Home Treatment Team (with consent) or for a Mental Health Act assessment (if no consent had been forthcoming).
 
The Trust’s Report stated: “There were no identified service delivery issues that impacted on the services’ ability to offer care and treatment”. However, in oral evidence, the Trust’s witness agreed this was inaccurate, following reflection upon the missed opportunities of investigating the events of 25th January 2023.
 
The Trust was unable to provide the Inquest with information to satisfy my concern that the Trust has robust systems in place to avoid the risk that staff may rely upon short summaries from British Transport Police, rather than scrutinising all the information contained within a referral and making relevant inquiries if the reporting is ambiguous or incomplete.
 
In this case, the Trust was clearly of the view that the detail was significant but was overly reliant upon partial information which resulted in missed opportunities for appropriate referral.",On 23 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Denise Jane PORTER.

He was advised that the additional cost of histological analysis of the excised samples would be c.£65 and so decided not to have the samples sent for analysis. When the lesion continued to trouble him in May 2020, he returned to his GP who referred him to dermatology, where a further excision was performed and analysed and was found to be melanoma. An ultrasound scan showed that the melanoma had metastisised to his lymph nodes, chest wall and lungs. Despite immunotherapy and targeted oral therapy, the melanoma continued to metastasise and in June 2022, scans showed that it had spread to Gregor’s brain such that his condition was terminal. He was placed onto a palliative care pathway and following an admission to Addenbrooke’s hospital on 6 July 2022, he died on 8 July 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
I was not able to conclude that, had the sample been sent for analysis in March 2019, any sign of melanoma would have been detected. Nevertheless, it is of concern that the barrier to undergoing a complete procedure, including histological analysis, appears to be one of cost. Anecdotal evidence received at inquest from treating clinicians was that the further costs associated with histological or other review, which on the NHS would be routinely included within the procedure at no charge to the patient, was a common disincentive to patients who would regularly opt not to have the further tests carried out.
While it is acknowledged that there have to be criteria for routine and non-emergency procedures to be conducted on the NHS, my concern relates to the disparity in what is included within the treatment when undertaken privately (where histological analysis is a separate and additional cost) and what is routinely included as part of NHS treatment
It therefore seems to me that there is a risk of future deaths if patients not meeting the NHS referral criteria, who have to pay for procedures to be carried out privately, opt on cost grounds not to have the histological analysis which would otherwise be provided on the NHS at no charge, as it is well-established fact that earlier detection and treatment is crucial in minimising the risks of developing metastatic cancers including melanoma.","On 29 July 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Gregor Patrick Edward Lynn aged 24 years.

Due to vegetation growth of trees and bushes on the verge of the public highway, the tractor driver’s line of sight was obstructed, making it impossible to assess whether there was adequate time and distance to safely exit the junction. Consequently, the motorbike’s path was blocked by the trailer and the rider could not take evasive action in time to avoid the collision.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
A thematic review completed in November 2021 had identified a number of significant issues in the functioning of mental health services, and many of the same issues were also identified in the serious incident review into Linda’s care and treatment, from February 2022 until her death. It is apparent that any actions taken as a result of the thematic review were not effective in implementing change and that the action plan was still a “work in progress” at the Pre Hearing Review Hearings which took place in this case in 2023.
The Serious Incident Investigation into the care received by Linda was not completed until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after the death. This is neither timely nor responsive. Despite reassurances given that the Trust are working to eradicate such delays, in response to a series of previous PFD reports issued by the Coroners of Durham and Darlington, there are still cases coming to the attention of the Coronial service where Serious Incident Investigations are significantly delayed in excess of the 60 day NHS framework.
As previously reported the concern in relation to the delays in such investigations and any subsequent necessary action required, is twofold. Firstly, the quality of the investigation is severely compromised as the evidence is not captured when memories are fresh. Secondly, because any lessons to be learnt and improvements to be made to improve patient safety cannot be implemented promptly.","On the 19th of April 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Linda Louise Banks, aged 48 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18th of December 2023. The medical cause of death was 1a) Paracetamol overdose with alcohol misuse. I gave a narrative conclusion as follows:-
 
Linda Louise Banks died on the 10th of April 2022 at the University Hospital of North Durham. Linda had a history of alcohol misuse and mental health difficulties, including self harm and suicidal ideation. Linda also had learning difficulties which may have increased her vulnerability, which were not identified by vast majority of the mental health professionals, and there is no evidence that consideration was given to any reasonable adjustments that might be necessary, or as to any impact such may have had on her presentation, communication and understanding.
 
Linda herself, her family and her friends, made multiple contacts with mental health services between February 2022 and her death, as her mental health deteriorated and concerns were expressed as to her safety. Referrals were also made by two external agencies, namely her GP and a home support agency, both expressing concerns about Linda’s presentation. On each occasion risks were considered to be minimal and no further treatment or care was provided by mental health services.
 
There were a multiplicity of difficulties revealed by a serious incident review which was extensively delayed and not received until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after Linda’s death. It concludes that Linda did not receive the right care at the right time and her needs were not fully met, and included concerns, in summary, in relation to the quality of assessments and triage, quality of safety planning, poor record keeping, and further considers that there was an underestimation of risk and a lack of a trauma informed approach. I also find that these difficulties culminated in advice being given to a friend attempting to support Linda and communicated to her family, from an unknown mental health worker, that they should consider “tough love” and to effectively step back from their intensive support of Linda, thus removing an essential safety net in the absence of any ongoing mental health treatment or support. The identified failings cumulatively contributed to the death more than minimally.
 
An earlier thematic review which had been completed in November 2021 identified many similar serious issues in the provision of mental health services, to those identified in this case, and it is clear that many of these issues were continuing at the time of Linda’s death in April of 2022 and had not been addressed effectively by the Trust.
 
On the 9th April 2022 Police forced entry to Linda’s home, as a result of concerns raised by her family and friends and was taken to hospital by ambulance. She was hyperthermic and had low blood sugar and had taken an overdose of medication. Despite attempts to treat her she died in hospital on the 10th April 2022 as a result of the acute complications of paracetamol overdose on a background of alcohol related liver disease",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23.2.24 .

She consulted with orthopaedic surgeons and it was decided that surgery would be appropriate to maintain her levels of independence. She underwent surgery on the 13 October 2022 and the orthopaedic outcome was satisfactory. Post-operatively, Mrs Waylett’s recovery was complicated by ongoing low blood pressure and intermittent oxygen requirements. From the early hours of 17 October 2022, she required a medical assessment, with medical intervention to address a likely pulmonary oedema and likely urinary tract infection. She did not receive the necessary medical intervention and on the 19 October 2022, she suffered a cardiac arrest on the ward. Resuscitation was provided and she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Sadly, she did not recover and she passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital in the early hours of the 20 October 2022. Had Mrs Waylett received the necessary medical intervention from the 17 October 2022 or even on the morning of the 19 October 2022, it is likely that her death would have been avoided.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

There was no clear cause or diagnosis for the seizures but it was felt that he was suffering from electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. In November 2022 a decision was made to commence him on high dose steroids, a known consequence of which was immunosuppression. He developed signs of chicken pox on Friday 17 February 2023 and was brought to his community paediatric appointment on 20 February 2023 but not seen and assessed as he was known to have a contagious disease. He was seen later that day by a nurse at his general practitioner surgery and was seen and sent home. A later discussion between a general practitioner at the surgery and the community paediatrician led to a referral to the paediatric assessment unit at Ipswich hospital. The unit was busy and an appointment was not made until the following morning. By 11am on 21 February 2023 Nuel had deteriorated further and his parents had to support and carry him to the paediatric assessment unit arriving at 11.05am. Observations taken at 11.30am revealed he was pyrexial, tachycardic and tachypnoeic but the sepsis pathway was not followed. He was prescribed paracetamol at 12.15 and seen by a paediatric registrar who did not consider the sepsis protocol should be initiated as there was a clear cause for his symptoms i.e chicken pox. The plan was made to observe him, recheck his observations and if he had improved to send him home with oral Acyclovir. At 13.20 he remained pyrexial and tachycardic and his respiratory rate was still high at 32 and he was prescribed Ibuprofen. By 15.30 his temperature had come down and his heart rate had settled but was still high at 118, as was his respiratory rate at 29. He was also unable to mobilise having previously not being limited with his mobility. He was confused but this was considered to be his usual presentation due to his neurodegenerative condition. The doctor who planned to discharge him did not discuss him with a Consultant and was not aware he needed a wheelchair to leave hospital having had no issues with his mobility prior to the onset of his current viral illness.
He was taken home by his parents and was unable to swallow his oral medication and took very little by way of fluids. He deteriorated the following day and collapsed shortly before 2pm. His parents called emergency services and police and paramedics attended. Despite attempts at resuscitation including in the emergency department at West Suffolk hospital he died later that afternoon. A post mortem revealed he had died as a consequence of Varicella Zoster.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
During the course of my investigation into the death of Nuel-Junior I instructed an independent paediatric expert to review his management and opine on causation. During the course of hearing the evidence from the expert and all of the treating clinicians it became clear that there was some potentially relevant guidance available but it lacked clarity. Here intravenous Acylovir, if prescribed, may have prevented Nuel-Junior’s death but he was instead prescribed oral Acyclovir which was unlikely to have made a difference. Had clear guidance been available then Nuel-Junior’s death may have been prevented.","On 11 April 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nuel-Junior Kerlii DZERNJO aged 10.

Ian fell so that he landed in front of the toilet block in the car park, suffering very serious injuries. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted at the scene by lifeguards and off duty doctors, before being conveyed to RCHT by ambulance. Ian was examined at hospital and found to have sustained multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs.
 
On 4 June 2022, Ian was transferred to Derriford Hospital for treatment of complex spinal fractures, under the neurosurgical team.
 
On 5 June 2022 Ian suffered a medical episode which developed into a critical incident in which Ian deteriorated rapidly and required life saving measures.
 
On 6 June 2022 Ian was taken to theatre for spinal surgery. Before surgery, the critical care flexible endotracheal tube was replaced by an armoured tube. After surgery, the anaesthetic team commenced an airway exchange, namely removing the armoured tube which had been inserted for the operation, in order to replace it with the more flexible critical care tube. However, having removed the armoured tube, the team were unable to insert the flexible tube despite repeated attempts. Ian then started to desaturate due to lack of oxygen. The Consultant Anaesthetist proceeded to jet ventilate Ian, the first jet was uneventful, the second resulted in massive neck swelling, Ian went into cardiac arrest. The medical team then resorted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency tracheostomy. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 20-25 minutes During this time Ian suffered hypoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen.
 
Over the following days, Ian suffered seizures on the intensive care unit and an MRI on 9 June 2022 showed extensive changes consistent with hypoxic brain injury.
 
On 15 June 2022, Ian’s care was transitioned to end–of-life care.
 
Ian died in the intensive care unit at Derriford hospital at 17:10 on 15 June 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
There was an error of omission in record keeping and in handover from critical care to surgery, and that this error likely contributed to Ian’s death.
There was no entry in Ian’s hospital notes to indicate the full extent of the critical incident of 5 June 2022.
There was a lack of information on handover from critical care to the surgical team regarding the full extent of the critical incident of the 5 June 2022. There was a verbal handover which was brief and vague. There was no formal written handover process highlighting significant events.
The error of omission was unexplained and has not been investigated by the NHS. The evidence regarding the error of omission came to light after the completion of the NHS investigation into Ian’s death. The Consultant Anaesthetist involved in Ian’s operation discovered the fact of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 on a later examination of ventilator data. The data indicated that Ian deteriorated significantly, that he was close to a cardiac arrest and the critical care team saved his life.
The surgical and anaesthetic team had no reason to suspect a secondary brain injury. The team had no information on Ian’s neurological status. Ian is likely to have suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the critical incident of 5th June. This will have undermined his resilience and ability to physically withstand the rigors of spinal surgery and airway exchange.
Had the surgical and anaesthetic team known of the extent of the critical incident of 5 June, the operation would have been delayed and further tests and assessments undertaken. The anaesthetic team may have opted for elective tracheostomy if the full circumstances of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 had been known. An elective tracheostomy would have led to
a different outcome because it would have avoided the complications that ensued from the attempted airway exchange.
I note the NHS Investigator and the Investigatory Panel both recommended that action is required for the handover of complex patients. The panel recommended as follows:
More robust and formalised handover of complex patients before transfer to theatre, to include review of airway management, cardiopulmonary status, potential avenues of deterioration and any significant events during admission
The Trust had chosen not to accept this recommendation but at the time the Trust made that decision it was not aware of the extent and significance of the error of omission.","On 7 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of 51 year old Ian Jacka.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1. The inquest heard that there are very long waiting lists for GID clinics. In September 2023, the average waiting time was in the region of 7 years. The expert instructed at the inquest identified that long waiting lists could intensify distress arising from gender dysphoria.
2. The inquest also heard that there is little local support available to patients who are waiting for assessment and treatment by Gender Identity Clinics .
3. There was a lack of clarity as to who is responsible for the wellbeing of the patient during the waiting period, for any distress caused by the gender dysphoria. There was a lack of consensus as to whether it would be the referrer or the GID clinic itself .
4. Local mental health services have very little specialist knowledge as to how best to support a person suffering from GID.
5. Those in attendance at the inquest were unclear about guidance available to GPs and other healthcare professionals to support them with the safe prescribing of bridging hormones, during the lengthy waiting period. The BMA’s guidance on the role of GPs in managing patients with gender incongruence (2022) and the Royal College of Psychiatrist’s advice relating to bridging prescriptions was not known by the healthcare professionals in attendance at the inquest hearing. There is a concern that primary and secondary/tertiary services are not working opt imally, to support those during the lengthy waiting periods.","On 1 April 20211 commenced an investigation into the death of Amarnih Louis Lewis­ Daniel, aged 24 years.

The inquest heard evidence that her mortality risk was around 40%. She provided verbal consent to the ascitic tap procedure but was not told there was a rare possibility of death if a surrounding structure were to be perforated. It appeared the procedure had been accomplished uneventfully on Friday 25/2/22, but within hours she complained of pain around the site of the procedure. On the Friday evening and during Saturday (25/26 February) her condition deteriorated, yet she was not reviewed or examined, nor were any other investigations initiated which may have halted this decline. On Sunday 27 February she was found in an unresponsive condition and died that day. Her family had not been forewarned of the seriousness of her illness, nor that her life was in danger and consequently went home some hours before she died.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

During a hospital admission in February 2022, she underwent an ascitic tap procedure that inadvertently perforated an artery, causing intra-abdominal bleeding that resulted in her death two days later. Within hours of the procedure, she was prescribed oramorph and other pain-relieving medications.

On 30 June 2021 Katherine was referred to the syringomyelia clinic (specialist clinic for patients with a syrinx). Although Katherine had back pain there was not felt to be a spinal surgical cause for this, and she was discharged from the complex spine clinic but was then referred to the pain team. Katherine had a history of progressive sensory and motor symptoms on the right side and because this could not be explained by her syrinx, an urgent MRI brain scan was requested. This scan was performed on 31 August 2021 and reported as normal. On 13 December 2021 Katherine was seen by a Consultant in Pain Medicine who noted the brain MRI of August looked abnormal and requested a review of the scan. On review there was a mass lesion that had been missed. Katherine underwent a further MRI of the brain where she was found to have tumour (left superior cerebellar / left quadrigeminal cistern region) which had increased in size by approximately 10mm since 31 August 2021. On 18 January 2022 a biopsy was undertaken to establish the type of tumour and a further scan took place on 2 February 2022 when the tumour was felt to have increased in size further. The tumour was found to be an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT). This being a highly malignant central nervous system neoplasm which generally affects infants and is reported to rarely occur in adults. The prognosis of this type of tumour was poor. The management plan was to remove as much of the tumour as possible and then treat it with chemotherapy and radiation. Katherine was consented for the procedure where the risk to life was deemed low. Katherine was admitted to the Walton Centre on 21 February 2022 and underwent the surgery on 22 February 2022. The surgery was uneventful, and a large portion of the tumour was removed but there was still part of the tumour that remained as it could not be removed. Post -operatively, Katherine was slow to wake, and a CT brain scan showed there was some blood at the site of surgery, and it was reviewed by the operating surgeons and no further surgery was felt to be necessary. The plan was to leave the external ventricular drain (EVD) in and continue high dose steroids to help reduce post operative swelling. Katherine was transferred to the intensive care unit to be kept sedated and ventilated overnight. As the sedation was reduced, Katherine became aware of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and bit down on it causing significant trauma to her tongue at the same time. The sedation was increased to enable Katherine to tolerate the tube again. Later that day the tongue was noted to be very swollen and was assessed as being a risk to the airway which prevented the removal of the ETT. The sedation was reduced over the ensuing 48 hours and neurological assessment showed improvement, eye opening to stimuli, obeying commands on the left side however there was still a severe weakness on the right side.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The case is a complex death where the immediate cause of death was blockage of an external ventricular drain resulting in hydrocephalus and coning. The written policy at this Trust, at the time, was not entirely clear about how the nursing staff should escalate things when a drain stopped draining but was still seen to be oscillating. Though some Trusts have developed their own policy on this area, these vary as there is currently no standard national policy dealing with this issue. This is a risk which needs to be highlighted at a national level.","On 23 October 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Katherine Sarah FLYNN aged 34.

Hazel Pearson was admitted into Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 20/8/21 having spent some time at a care home and community hospital before returning to Ysbyty Maelor hospital on 23/11/21. She had known coeliac disease which was recorded on her medical records. Her family had repeatedly informed staff about her coeliac disease. On 26/11/21 she was offered and consumed Weetabix probably believing it was a gluten free equivalent. This caused her to vomit, aspirate, suffer significant oxygenation and subsequent respiratory deterioration which then led to her death from aspiration pneumonia. She died on 30/11/21 at Ysbyty Maelor, Wrexham.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. Despite the deceased passing away just shy of 2 years ago, there have been inadequate improvements to manage patients with food intolerances and allergies. The Health Board has been working with other organisations in Wales to create an e-learning module and implement the use of red wrist bands for food intolerances / allergies, but this has taken far too long. The e-learning training module was uploaded to BCUHB system the day prior to the Inquest. It is strongly suspected that this was due to the impending Inquest.
 
2. The Health Board has not investigated the incident at all. A Medical Examiner Report was prepared following the death in November 2021 highlighting the ingestion of gluten in a coeliac patient. I have raised and continue to raise a number of concerns around the inadequacy of governance and poor investigation processes.
 
3. There were other incidences of gluten ingestion at Ysbyty Maelor and Deeside Community Hospital. On the at least 4 occasions at Deeside Community Hospital there were no Datix reports completed at the time. I was provided with no evidence that additional training, refresher training or induction training deals with when such reports should be made. I cannot be satisfied and reassured that all staff are aware of when to make a Datix report and how to complete this.","On 6 December 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Hazel Pearson (DOB 28/6/42) who died on 30 November 2021.

They were murdered by Terri’s partner Damien Bendall, curfewed to the address under a suspended sentence order, who had inflicted severe head injuries on all four, and he had also raped Lacey.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Probation Service (PS) offender records and documents.
 
The inquests identified that very concerning information regarding Damien Bendall was made known to the PS (including violent assault and injury of a partner, and an incident of possible child sexual abuse) but was not recorded clearly or prominently for subsequent PS practitioners to read and evaluate in risk assessment and decision- making, and indeed was not read at key and critical points. Although this was in part due to the recording made by individual PS practitioners it was also the result of confusing proformas (e.g. the OASys misleading drop-down boxes and the open and closed sections), imprecise arrangements and expectations of how and where such information should be recorded, and where checks should be directed and made when the records needed to be reviewed. The inquests were informed of current PS expectations for recording offender risk information and assessments, but I remain very unsure that there are clear and efficient recording arrangements and systems to ensure that risk information is accurate, prominent, easily seen, and easily updateable by PS practitioners.
 
PS domestic abuse (DA) and child safeguarding (SG) checks
 
The inquests identified that DA and SG checks were either insufficient or wholly lacking at various stages of Damien Bendall’s offender management. The current evidence is that DA and SG checks remain generally insufficient or are not being done with consequent on-going risks to children and women.
 
Insufficient or absent PS DA and SG checks has been a theme of HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and reviews for at least the last 5 years. On HM Inspectorate of Probation case sampling to determine whether domestic abuse and child safeguarding enquiries were being undertaken when indicated, the HM Inspectorate of Probation Annual Report for 2022/2023 states at page 38: –
 
where inspectors judged that these enquiries needed to be made by the probation practitioner, child safeguarding enquiries were carried out in 55 per cent of cases, domestic abuse enquiries were only carried out in 49 per cent of cases and risk of harm was only properly addressed in 39 per cent.
 
The PS is not currently conducting SG checks in all cases where an offender will live with or have access to children.
 
The PS has mandated that in all cases where a curfew condition is proposed to the court in a pre-sentence report (PSR) DA and SG checks will be conducted prior to the proposal and submission of the PSR: this is not being done in all cases. I am also unclear whether contact to the address homeowner/lead tenant for a potential curfew condition to discuss the suitability of a curfew condition is being undertaken in all cases.
 
Relatedly, although I have not taken evidence on this wider issue, it appears to me that the systems for conducting DA and SG checks are generally severely strained. I say this because as an example the PS has now employed staff to make the checks from police records and has had to do this because the police service itself is unable to check and provide the information to the PS within necessary timeframes.
 
PS PSR reports
 
There is no evidence that DA and SG checks were made by the PS practitioner in respect of Damien Bendall’s PSR report. Via the report the court was informed that checks had been conducted. The PS practitioner put forward a curfew provision as appropriate and the report was written in such a way to indicate that the report writer had checked the suitability of the curfew address, when she had not in fact done so. Had the court not been misled it is unlikely that the court’s disposal would have included a curfew requirement.
 
The inquests heard that PSRs written by the same PS practitioner, reviewed before her submission of Damien Bendall’s PSR, and reports reviewed after the murders, also lacked evidence of DA and SG checks having been made even though they were stated to have been done in the reports.
 
Evidence from senior PS staff was to the effect that failing to undertake the checks and failure to make this explicitly clear in a PSR might be dealt with by management feedback to the PS practitioner but is an unlikely to be a disciplinary matter. This leads me to question whether, given the potentially very disastrous outcomes in terms of public protection, the PS is failing to grasp the seriousness of the issue, to make this explicit to PS practitioners, and ensure that there are commensurate penalties for staff where these professional duties have been breached.
 
PS DA and SG training
 
A significant issue in the inquests was the fact that the very inexperienced staff who were (wrongly) allocated Damien Bendall’s case on transfer to the East Midlands PS region had insufficient DA and SG training. The PS states it has introduced more robust DA and SG training, but it is unclear whether PS practitioners are receiving this before cases are allocated to them to manage.
 
Reporting concerns to the PS by the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS)
 
Damien Bendall made the comment “if this relationship goes bad I’ll murder my girlfriend and the children” to the EMS field operative who fitted his tag and monitoring equipment but this was not reported back by the field operative to her manager nor to the PS. EMS has stated that it has introduced relevant training but the inquest heard evidence from the field operative that comments made by offenders which can be interpreted as potentially posing risk are currently routinely not being reported back by EMS field operatives.
 
The inquests examined the relevant contract terms between the Ministry of Justice and Capita (EMS) relating to reporting concerns and there did appear to be lack of clarity on reporting mechanisms and issues to report.
 
Notification of missed substance misuse appointments to the PS
 
In Derbyshire the substance misuse services provided to offenders where there is a court-imposed sentence requirement for such services is provided under the auspices of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS FT. Damien Bendall was subject to an alcohol treatment requirement. The precise number is not clear on the records, but he missed 4 or 5 appointments with the service between 21 July and his first attended appointment on 17 September 2021, but the required proforma attendance/non-attendance forms were not sent by the substance misuse service to notify the PS.","On 23 September 2021 I commenced investigations into the deaths of Terri Liz Harris aged 35, her children John-Paul Bennett and Lacey Bennett, aged 13 and 11 respectively, and their friend Connie Gent aged 11.

He lived in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. Mr Goodwin had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Dementia in 2016 and observed to be unable to assess risk to his own safety in 2022. He also had a history of depression and anxiety. On
10th November 2022 Mr Goodwin was struck by a train whilst walking along the railway track in the vicinity of Dalton-in-Furness Station. His death was confirmed at 00:17 on 11th November 2022. A post mortem examination has confirmed that Mr Goodwin had ingested a significant amount of alcohol prior to his death. It is more likely than not that he happened on to the railway track as a result of his dementia and alcohol consumption.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
(1)  The Liaison and Diversion of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust had contact with Mr Goodwin in September and October 2022. Liaison and Diversion Team members visited Mr Goodwin at home and concluded that he was at risk of self- neglect. They noted his appearance, his living conditions and the fact that he was not taking prescribed medication. On any view Mr Goodwin was vulnerable: he suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia, and was thought to misuse alcohol. The Liaison and Diversion Team considered that there were safeguarding concerns in respect of Mr Goodwin and referred him to the Adult Social Care team of Cumbria Council. I understand that the team in question now forms part of Westmorland and Furness Council. Despite this referral from practitioners who had personally visited Mr Goodwin, it was rejected at triage on 5th October 2022. I am concerned that this indicates that an approach to triage is being taken which pays insufficient regard to the concerns of practitioners who had personally witnessed apparent safeguarding concerns.
 
(2)  The witness statement on behalf of the Adult Social Care team explains that after the refusal to conduct a safeguarding enquiry, Mr Goodwin was nevertheless referred for the Social Work team to ‘engage’ with him. A social worker took steps to engage with Mr Goodwin and his family and concluded that a care assessment was appropriate. Despite
this the ‘Reablement Team’ referred the case for closure indicating that they did not consider that such an assessment was not required. I am concerned that this indicates further circumstances in which the needs of a vulnerable person might be overlooked. After a social worker considered that a care assessment was needed the Reablement Team appear to be able to come to an alternative view and close the case without further discussion or rationale. In another case this might lead to a vulnerable person being disregarded.
 
(3)  Fortunately, the Closure Team noticed that the Reablement Team were seeking to close a case in which another social worker had recommended a Care Assessment. They sent the case to the ‘Short Term Allocation Tray’. This should have resulted in a referral but that did not happen. I am concerned that in a future case a referral might not be generated and a person’s needs overlooked. The witness statement prepared by the Service Manager indicated ‘we are looking at a way of ensuring that notifications requiring an action are only acknowledged once the task is complete’. This indicates that such work has not yet borne fruit and the risk still exists.
 
(4)  Thereafter Mr Goodwin’s case was allocated and de-allocated to a social worker within the space of one day, without anything being done. It is said that there is no note or explanation for this. I am concerned that, once again, the ability of a case to be allocated and deallocated within a short period and without anything having been done may enable a case to ‘fall through the cracks’. Indeed, the referral for the care assessment was not ultimately actioned until 25th November 2022, 2 weeks after Mr Goodwin died.
 
(5)  More generally, it is striking how many different teams and systems appear to co-exist and require mutual communication and cross referencing. I am concerned that the above narrative demonstrates that those systems do not function effectively. I am concerned that this exposes other vulnerable adults to risk.","On    16    November    2022 I    commenced    an    investigation    into    the    death      of Gerald GOODWIN.

He underwent an endoscopy on 18 August 2022 where biopsies were taken. The results showed abnormal cells. On 15 September, Mr Di Blasi was referred by a GP to the Lower Gastro-intestinal team for possible bowel cancer and had a CT scan on 4 November 2022. The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the
report until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022. The incidental findings were not considered to be ‘significant’ by the Radiologists and were not therefore warrant an alert being sent to the referring clinician, leaving the report to be reviewed when they were able to. My investigation revealed that the timeframe for seeing patients on the cancer referral pathway is the date of the first appointment and there are no other target dates in respect of investigations of subsequent treatment.
 
Mr Di Blasi underwent a further endoscopy on 30 November 2022. The Endoscopist was unaware of these incidental findings. A biopsy was taken from an area which looked abnormal but was actually a gastric varix. As a result of this, Mr Di Blasi suffered a massive bleed and despite maximal supportive measures, he died on 1 December 2022 at the Bristol Royal Infirmary, Upper Maudlin Street, Bristol, BS2 8HW.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
(1)  That one of the teams caring for Mr Di Blasi was completely unaware of the input from another specialty team, despite both referrals being made under the 2-week urgent referral pathway. The lack of communication between these teams meant that timely sharing of results did not occur. Even the very knowledge of the fact that a CT scan had taken place would have alerted the endoscopist to check those results, and it is likely that the second endoscopy would not have gone ahead. I understand this to be a national issue and is likely to apply to other investigations being carried out.
 
(2)  That the reporting timeframes on the 2-week urgent cancer pathway referral does not take into account timeframes for reporting investigative procedures or subsequent review by the referring clinicians.
 
(3)  The current training for Endoscopists for JAG certification requires the performance
of 200 endoscopies. However, these tend to focus on the clinician’s area of specialty and therefore there is a danger that lesion recognition will be limited and insufficient to ensure that endoscopists are able to recognise less frequently occurring lesions. With the need for an increasing number of endoscopists, action should be taken.","On 13th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Calogero Di Blasi. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was:   ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, the Secretary of State for Health, have the power to take such action, and that University Hospitals Bristol & Weston also have the power to take such action on a local level.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10 January 2024.

Investigations identified a pelvic abscess and bowel obstruction as the source of sepsis which was not amenable to radiological drainage. He underwent an emergency laparotomy the same day with findings of a pelvic abscess from a perforated gangrenous appendix and non-viable adjacent colonic tissue and small bowel obstruction. This required drainage of the abscess, removal of the gangrenous tissue and bowel and formulation of a stoma. As part of the pre-surgical preparations for post operative care the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) was undertaken using the right subclavian vein. A landmark approach was used. There was no use of ultrasound to assist placement of the CVC despite this being available. As part of the checks to ensure correct placement of the CVC a check chest x-ray was undertaken. Other checks in the form of an arterial blood gas and transducing the intra-vessel pressure wave via the CVC were not undertaken even though the necessary equipment to do so was available. The check chest x-ray was incorrectly interpreted as showing correct placement into the vein whereas, in fact, the CVC had been incorrectly placed into the artery. The check chest x-ray was not reviewed by the consultant who had undertaken the procedure until a later point after discovery that the CVC had been incorrectly placed. Whilst the evidence identified incorrect placement of a CVC was a recognised complication, it was accepted that the various steps detailed above that would have reduced this happening were not undertaken.","During the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Mr Gale was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was seen regularly by mental health professionals and was in frequent contact with mental health services. Those services were provided by Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Gale was compliant with his medication and engaged with services. He was well supported by his family and friends.
 
Mr Gale’s anxiety continued during his engagement with mental health services. Evidence was heard about what caused Mr Gale’s anxiety. One ongoing feature was his application for Universal Credit.
 
On 2 March 2023, 2 days before his death, Mr Gale was seen by an Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the inquest. The Psychiatrist considered Mr Gale’s anxiety was exacerbated by his application for Universal Credit. During Mr Gale’s appointment, the Psychiatrist called the benefits office for help but the call was not answered before the end of the consultation. Mr Gale was expecting a call from a DWP representative the next day (3 March).
 
On 3 March 2022 at approximately 11:00 am, Mr Gale spoke to the duty Registered Mental Health Nurse. He remained very anxious and his main concern was the application for Universal Credit.
 
During their evidence, the Associate Specialist Psychiatrist expressed concerns about the experience of mental health service users with DWP. These concerns were not just specific to Mr Gale.
 
Evidence was also given by the Trust’s Group Nurse Director (a Registered Mental Health Nurse) who considered that the issues identified by the Psychiatrist were national. The Director considered it important to address these issues as they were debilitating for service users.
 
The Director advised that the Trust’s Crisis Team had started a food bank 3 years ago to support service users. The Director was also aware that the DWP had been invited to the Cumbria Suicide Prevention Group.
 
I stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Gale’s death and his anxiety about his Universal Credit application. DWP was not an Interested Person in Mr Gale’s inquest and did not give evidence as the concerns raised did not come to light until the hearing.","The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Current DWP procedures may not be practical for those with mental health illness and can exacerbate symptoms. I heard evidence that:
 
1.     The number of and length of DWP forms required to be completed can be overwhelming for someone with a mental health illness. This is perpetuated if the applicant cannot get help to complete the paperwork.
2.     There are long telephone queues to speak to a DWP advisor.
3.     Having to travel long distances for appointments can be detrimental for those with a mental health illness.","Mr Kevin Conrad GALE died on 4 March 2022 at his home address.

On being woken from the anaesthetic it was immediately apparent that Tracy had sustained serious brain injury. She died in hospital on the 19th of November 2016. On the balance of probability, it is likely that Tracy would have died as a result of the damage caused by the first incision.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 19th of December 2023.

He underwent a series of diagnostic tests.
 
At admission Mr Doyle was found to be experiencing two factors that fall within the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria in defining severe sepsis – an elevated white blood cell count and tachycardia.
 
Despite these findings and in contravention of the Trust policy, a diagnostic process required to confirm or eliminate a diagnosis of sepsis was not commenced at that time. Subsequently, there were a further two missed opportunities to commence the diagnostic pathway in the next 24 hour period.
 
In the early hours of the morning of 24th January 2023 Mr Doyle suffered a significant drop in blood pressure, intravenous anti-biotics were commenced. Despite appropriate treatment, Mr Doyle continued to deteriorate and subsequently died.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1.     The trust’s clinical records were of a particularly poor standard which impeded the Trust’s governance investigation and the inquest investigation in determining what, if any consideration was given to the possibility that Mr Doyle was suffering from an infection.
 
The Trust’s failure to commence a diagnostic pathway to investigate sepsis when clearly indicated on Mr Doyle’s admission, as required by both local policy and national guidance.","On 26th January 2023 this Court commenced an investigation into the death of Thomas Doyle aged 90 years.

She recovered well from this, and was discharged to the Haywood Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent on the 18 September 2021.
 
ii)  During her stay at the Haywood Hospital she developed a pressure sore which developed eventually into a Grade 4 Pressure sore.
 
iii) On the 10 November 2021, she developed symptoms of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, and was taken to the Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent where an oesophageal gastro duodenoscopy was performed. She was discharged back to the Haywood Hospital on the 11 November 2021.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

She presented with a headache and vomiting which had started two days previously. She was prescribed antibiotics for a suspected infection. It is probable that the symptoms were due to a subarachnoid haemorrhage due to a burst aneurysm. A hospital referral at this point would probably have identified the subarachnoid haemorrhage and allowed preventative treatment to reduce the risk of her developing severe vasospasm. On 2nd April 2023 an ambulance was called as she was feeling unwell. The ambulance crew did not recognise that her behaviour was inconsistent with her usual presentation. She was taken to Tameside General Hospital where there was a prolonged wait to be seen. A CT scan undertaken showed evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage that had occurred previously around 28th March 2023. The scan was incorrectly reported as being clear. At Tameside General Hospital her consciousness levels were reduced, and she was agitated. She had probably developed a severe vasospasm from the subarachnoid haemorrhage. Treatment options at this point are extremely limited. An MRI scan on 5th April 2023 showed multi territorial infarctions and significant narrowing of all the intracranial vessels. On the balance of probabilities, the neurological situation was probably irreversible on her admission to Tameside General Hospital. She was transferred to Salford Royal Hospital where attempts to treat her were unsuccessful. She died at Salford Royal Hospital on 11th April 2023.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The inquest heard evidence that early identification of a burst aneurysm is vital if treatment is to be offered at an early enough stage to reduce the risk of death.
The inquest was told that particularly in primary care the symptoms are not readily understood and awareness is often low. In Kirsty Hendry’s case she had the key symptoms that are linked to a burst aneurysm.","On 18th April 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Michelle Hendry.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1.     The concerns within the hospital and non-compliance with the LRCP protocol has been addressed by way of an investigation & action plan.
 
2.     The nurse at the practice told the Inquest, the procedure for practice staff calling 999 (not leaving it to the patient) in the event of a patient with chest pain and other life threatening conditions applied only to reception staff and not to nursing staff. This led to inconsistency and in this case an avoidable delay in summoning urgent medical assistance and needs reviewing/all staff working in/working on behalf of the practice need to be aware of the procedure to be followed, consideration must be given as to whether it is appropriate to have different standards for qualified nursing and administrative/non qualified nursing staff. The awareness of Dissecting Aortic Aneurysm and the rapidity at which the condition can become catastrophic/fatal also needs raising within the practice.
 
The nurse within the practice who spoke with Wayne on the date of his death on behalf of the practice , did not escalate to a doctor, did not call 999, she did not inform the NOK of her concerns, she did not call back to see if Wayne had called for an ambulance/attended hospital and she did not alert the hospital of her suspicions

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
(1)  The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner’s service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased’s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be’ likely end of July/August time’. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the ‘end of September/beginning of October’ and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased’s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author’s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due ‘end of September/beginning of October’. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.
 
(2)  The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.
 
(3)  If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah’s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.
 
(4)  I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths.
 
(5)  I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust’s response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report.",,In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6th of December 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1. The Coroner recommends to the MPS that they consider whether there is any alternative and less cumbersome water rescue equipment [to throw lines] that could be issued to officers on patrol near bodies of water, for example some sort of device which could be inflated quickly and thrown to the person in the water to assist them in floating until a throw line is available.","On 8th October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lamont Ashley Roper.

·      Notwithstanding that I determined that it could not be established this fatal house fire was contributed to by Kiran’s eating disorder and how it was managed and responded to, I was satisfied that I have a duty to write this report.
 
·      At the time of her death, Kiran lived alone her flat with support from adult social care. A support worker assisted her with tasks such as ordering prescriptions, booking taxis, medical appointments, for example.
·      Although Kiran was said to have maintained a chronic low weight for some time, evidence before the inquest suggested that in the weeks prior to her death she lost significant weight, and could take steps to avoid accurate recording of her weight, such as on two occasions when she refused to remove her boots prior to being weighed. Her BMI was 14, and would reduce further. She was said to have been “presenting as not eating, and with an increased level of confusion” and no longer willing to have prescribed ensure drinks, something she had previously agreed to.
 
·      The quality of assistance she received from professionals varied. A support worker was proactive in seeking to provide Kiran with the help she needed, By contrast, during an inadequate mental health assessment the extent of her eating disorder and a declining weight was not considered to the degree clearly required.
 
·      This inquest was held some time after Kiran’s death, the inquest having been necessarily adjourned on previous occasions for a range of reasons.
 
·      The court heard how, at the time Kiran died, in terms of managing and treating an eating disorder the relevant guidance was what is often referred to as the MARSIPAN guidance. Some time later, from around May 2022, the Royal   College of Psychiatrists replaced that guidance with their up-dated Guidance on Recognising and Managing Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders, sometimes known as the MEED guidance.

However, no significant internal investigation into Kiran’s death had taken place since, and no changes have  been made in response to her death.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In   the circumstances it is my statutory duty to send the report:
 
The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows.
 
Eating disorders are increasingly prevalent. An eating disorder is a mental disorder and with a known high risk of mortality.
 
Many vulnerable people live in the community with support from adult social care, but who may not have access to specialist eating disorder services, perhaps due to a lack of availability or because they are reluctant to engage with specialist services.
 
As part of their illness, they may be reluctant to discuss their condition with family members, friends, or attend their GP surgery for monitoring of their weight.
 
It is important that adult social care staff, should they become aware of concerning signs of a previously unknown eating disorder problem, or identify a possible deterioration in the condition of a service user previously diagnosed with an eating disorder, take action within their range of powers to raise such concerns with the appropriate professionals, and possibly family members.
 
I have a concern that in the absence of the tools, training and access to the relevant guidance, well – meaning adult social care staff may not recognise when a situation arises and the service user will go without necessary and often very urgent, medical assessment and treatment, and with fatal consequences.
 
I do not seek to be prescriptive about what should now happen, and that is not the purpose of this report. I simply raise the concern.","The death of Kirandip Bharaj [known to her family as Kiran] on 14th September 2019 was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest on 30th September 2023.

He applied for indefinite leave to remain in 2004 but this was rejected in the same year.
2.        He had a history of severe mental health issues.
3.        Mr Santos was remanded to HMP Highdown on 29 October 2019, being transferred to HMP Belmarsh on 26 November 2019. On 6 May 2020, Mr Santos was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and was due to be released on 27 October 2020.
4.        On 5 October 2020, the Immigration Service served an IS91 notice of a decision to detain on Mr Santos. This meant he would not be released from prison at the end of his sentence whilst his deportation was considered. A Stage 1 letter had been served on 28 December 2018 but a Stage 2 letter had not been served. There was also an outstanding appeal in the First-tier immigration Tribunal.
5.        Mr Santos wrote a letter on a bail form outlining his concerns about returning to Brazil, referring to his sexuality and his health. This was sent by the prison to a charity assisting immigration detainees on 29 October 2020.
6.        In the early hours of 2 November 2020, the night officer found Mr Santos hanging in his cell during a routine check. Staff tried to resuscitate him. Ambulance staff arrived. Mr Santos was declared dead at 3.30am.
 
In summary, the jury found as follows:
 
·       That Mr Santos’ understanding of his immigration position at the conclusion of his custodial sentence made a material contribution to his death.
·       There was a failure to notify Mr Santos of the incoming IS91 form and its significance.
·       The central issue was communication between Mr Santos and the various agencies involved with him. By 16 October 2020 Mr Santos understood he would be detained at the end of his sentence but was confident his bail application would lead to resolution. However in the days prior to his death he told a fellow prisoner he believed he was to be placed in immigration detention and deported within days.
·       Confusion amongst the agencies involved in communicating with Mr Santos is likely to have played a vital role in his change of understanding but it was difficult to pinpoint the role that information passed to Mr Santos played in changing his understanding of his position. There were no adequate notes of a meeting on 22 October 2020 with Mr Santos and his prison and community offender managers. However it was clear that his view of his circumstances changed and he decided to end his life and deliberately did not clearly communicate his intent to those around him.","During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.
 
I have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1.      Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as “causative matters” in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases.
Timing of IS91 notification.
 
2.      The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage.
Signposting legal advice about immigration matters
 
3.      Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.
4.      I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.
5.      In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.
Communication between agencies
 
6.      Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.
7.      I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.
 
Delays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.
 
8.      I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos’ case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos’ case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.
9.      I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.
The SSHD Internal report
 
10.    The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos’ case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.
11.    The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos’ case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.
12.    This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been.","1.      The death of Manoel Messias Santos (“Mr Santos”) was reported to the coroner by HMP Belmarsh on the date of his death, 2 November 2020.                                                                                      .
2.      A forensic post-mortem was conducted on 5 November 2020. The medical cause of death of MS was 1a: Hanging
3.      On 24 February 2021 an Inquest was opened into the death of Mr Santos and an Article 2 Inquest was heard between 11 September 2023 and 25 September 2023 with a jury. The jury concluded with a narrative conclusion incorporating a conclusion of suicide.
4.      I considered Prevention of Future Death (“PFD”) evidence (written and oral) on 27 September 2023.","Action should be taken by The Secretary of State for the Home Department, HMP Belmarsh, His Majesty’s Prison and Probation Service, the Ministry of Justice and Practice Plus Group:
 
1.    Consideration as to whether FNOs can be notified at an earlier stage of their sentence that they are not going to be released. (SSHD)
2.      Consideration as to how to ensure there is effective signposting and facilitating of access to legal advice for FNOs. (HMP Belmarsh, HMPPS, MOJ)
3.      Consideration as to how to ensure more effective communication/information exchange between the SSHD and the prison and Healthcare. (HMP Belmarsh, HMPPS, MOJ, SSHD, Practice Plus)
4.      Consideration to be given as to why the Internal report dated February 2021 was not disseminated/placed on the Home Office file and to ensure this does not occur again. (SSHD)

Ms Kerr was not seen by a surgeon or clinician prior to the 19 November 2019. Evidence revealed that Ms Kerr underwent a limited assessment prior to the procedures. The evidence is that Ms Kerr was provided with limited information regarding the risks and mortality  rate associated  with the procedures.  The fat  was collected and processed  before it was injected into her buttocks; a liposuction procedure and a Brazilian Buttock Lift procedure. During surgery Ms Kerr became unwell. Her condition deteriorated and she was declared dead. There is limited documentary evidence as to the procedures performed.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1.    Expert evidence was heard that the findings in this case are consistent with findings in other cases where patients have died following autologous fat transfer to the gluteal area during an operation colloquially known as Brazilian Buttock Lift. I understand from the evidence heard that due to the high mortality associated with this procedure a voluntary moratorium on the practice of this procedure has been introduced in the UK. Recommendations for safer practices have emerged that recommend significant changes to practice.
2.    I am concerned that patients travelling to Turkey for this procedure are not being made aware of the risks and the high mortality rate associated with this surgery
3.    I am also concerned that patients are travelling abroad where there are no or limited controls with regard to such surgery taking place. Evidence was heard there Ms Kerr was  not seen by a surgeon before the date of the procedure. There was limited psychological and physical assessment prior to the procedure proceeding.
4.    I appreciate the UK Government has no control over what happens abroad. However I am concerned that citizens are travelling abroad for such procedures unaware of the risks involved and that practices are used which are regarded as unsafe in the UK.","On 09 December 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Melissa Hannah KERR aged 31.

On 1st March 2023 he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham with suspected biliary sepsis/ascending cholangitis due to an obstructing bile gall stone as well as a bilateral basal consolidation which was revealed by a chest x ray.   Whilst in the ED, he was initially prescribed Tazocin for treatment of the sepsis but was then given a dose of Gentamicin which is in fact contraindicated in patients suffering from Myasthenia Gravis. He was not prescribed his normal Pyridostigmine.   On 2nd March he was transferred to a Liver ward for further treatment and arrangements were made for him to undergo an Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography Procedure (‘ERCP’) which could not be done until 3rd March.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1.       During the course of the inquest I heard evidence from the author of a Serious Investigation Report commissioned by the Trust (University Hospitals Birmingham) that the errors with regard to medication were, in part, due to a lack of awareness on the part of clinicians within the Trust as to the seriousness of Myasthenia Gravis as well as the interaction between Gentamicin and this condition.
2.       I also heard evidence from the author of the SI report about a comprehensive action plan that is being put in place to raise awareness within the Trust including the development and issue of a Trust wide patient safety notice in relation to Antibiotic Prescribing in patients with Myasthenia Gravis.
3.       However, given the apparent lack of awareness about Myasthenia Gravis amongst clinicians within UHB, a large hospital trust in a significant metropolitan area, I am concerned that there is a risk that a similar lack of awareness could persist amongst clinicians in other areas of the country and that consideration should be given to raising awareness more widely.","On 13 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Graham Thomas John SMITH.

Prior to the incident on the 26th June 2021 evidence shows Kelvin was suffering undiagnosed mental health problems, which were deteriorating over several months. Attempts by Kelvin’s mother to secure mental health assistance for him were unsuccessful, as no formal assessments were made. His mental health then spiralled significantly in the four days proceeding the incident. On the morning of 26th June 2021, Kelvin became extremely violent, firstly trying to forcefully baptise his partner’s children in the bath. His partner and her daughter were able to flee to knock on the neighbours flat ([REDACTED]) to seek assistance to call the police. His partner was then dragged back [REDACTED]. Kelvin then forcefully regained control of her two year old son and began to progress into holding him under water causing him to become unconscious. On a second successful attempt to flee to the neighbours flat ([REDACTED]), his partner and her daughter asked the neighbours to help save her son as Kelvin was trying to kill him. The[REDACTED]neighbour then went into [REDACTED] to try and save the two year old boy but was bludgeoned to death [REDACTED]. The neighbours [REDACTED] called the police and gave shelter to Kelvin’s partner and her daughter. At this point, the first officer on scene attempted to gain entry after announcing she was police but was unsuccessful, so called for back-up assistance with method of entry equipment.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Out of hours and emergency mental health care for people who are not registered with an NHS GP in Milton Keynes may be obtained by attending the Emergency Department at the Milton Keynes University Hospital where mental health professionals are based.
 
Through Kelvin’s period of deteriorating mental health, which was obvious to those who knew him, his mother made repeated attempts to secure mental health assessment and care for him.
 
She was not directed clearly by the professionals she did have contact with, to take him to the Emergency Department for assistance. There was a gap which Kelvin fell through and he did not receive either mental health assessment or care. It was not possible to say that the failure to receive assessment or care resulted in Kelvin attempting to take the lives of others and succeeding in taking the life of his male neighbour.
 
It was clear that the lack of clear information and direction in regard to how to obtain that mental health assessment or care contributed to Kelvin not presenting for assessment which may possibly have averted the tragic events which unfolded on the 26th June 2021. This in turn raises the prospect that others, in similar predicaments may also be unable to obtain the care required.",On 01 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Odichukwumma Kelvin IGWEANI aged 24.

These difficulties included self harm and suicidal ideation, as a result of command auditory hallucinations.
 
On the 2nd of May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance with a mental health crisis and suicidal ideation, [REDACTED]. He was clear that what would help him would be “to not go home” and that he did not feel safe at home. He was discharged in the absence of any comprehensive assessment, and in the absence of liaison with his family. The clinician assessing him did not have all of the important information to be able to carry out a comprehensive risk assessment, including in relation to recent incidents of self harm.
 
The deceased was seen by his care co ordinator on the 3rd of May 2022. The de- ceased again confirmed that he had drunk bleach on the command of voices, and both he and family were asking for admission. There was no comprehensive assessment. Again the clinician was not aware of important information which should have been taken into account in any assessment of risk, including in relation to self harm.
 
On the 4th of May 2022 the deceased presented at hospital via ambulance [REDACTED]. He told Doctors in the Emergency Department he had done this at the command of voices, that he still felt suicidal, and if discharged he would attempt to take his life again. There was no comprehensive assessment by mental health services and the clinician was not in possession of all relevant information as to risk. The deceased was discharged on the basis that there was no indication of current suicidal ideation at the point of the assessment or objective evidence of psychosis, to his home address, where he had indicated he did not feel safe. Whilst awaiting transport the deceased left the hospital having discarded his mobile phone and was reported missing. He was assessed as medium risk by the Police in the light of information provided by mental health services which had not been up- dated and did not include all risk events.
 
Having left the hospital, the deceased fell or jumped [REDACTED] on the 5th May 2023, despite the efforts of Police officers on the scene. Kenneth’s intention cannot be established although it is known that the deceased was suffering from a deterioration in his mental health in the days leading up to his death, including evidence of auditory command hallucinations to harm himself.
 
Mental health services involved with the deceased, did not carry out comprehensive mental state assessments despite the escalating risks which were known or ought to have been known, and did not fully involve family members in care, safety and dis- charge planning, who were crucial to his safety.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
(1) The serious incident investigation report in this case was not available in this case until the 24.03.2023, over 10 months since the death and around 8 months outside the NHS framework guidance of 60 days for the completion of such, despite repeated requests and a schedule 5 notice being issued to attempt to obtain a copy of the draft report to inform this investigation, which was not complied with.","On the 16th May 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Kenneth Rippon, aged 47 years.

The conclusion of the inquest was that Kenneth died on the 5th of May 2022 when he jumped or fell from the viaduct at Durham Train station, sustaining fatal injuries.The medical cause of death was multiple injuries. I recorded a narrative conclusion which included my finding that mental health services inadequate response to escalating risks, which were known or ought to have been known, including the failure to include family in assessment and safety/discharge planning contributed, more than minimally, to the death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13th September 2023.

It was identified she had had a heart attack and needed a pacemaker. Whilst at Macclesfield she had a fall on 27th January whilst unobserved in a bay where she should have been observed but she sustained no significant injury. She was transferred to Stepping Hill Hospital as a day patient on 2nd February 2023 for a pacemaker to be fitted. During the fitting she sustained a pneumothorax a recognised complication of the pacemaker fitting. A chest drain was fitted and she was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital whilst the chest drain was required. On the 12th February 2023 she had an unwitnessed fall but sustained no significant injury, She was identified as having acute coronary syndrome and treated with anticoagulants. On 13th February the chest drain was removed and on 14th February she was deemed to be medically optimised for discharged. She was in a bay where a member of staff should have remained at all times. That did not happen. Whilst unobserved she had an accidental fall when she tried to mobilise independently from her chair. She was sent for a CT scan and a bleed to the brain was identified. She deteriorated rapidly and died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 14th February 2023 as a consequence of her head injury.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
The inquest heard evidence that to deal with the risk of falls in patients deemed to be high risk the concept of observable bay nursing had been introduced at both Trusts. At both Trusts Mrs Nickson fell whilst unobserved due to the challenges of maintaining the bays as observed bays. The challenge for both trusts had arisen where staff were required to deal with issues out of the bay and left the bay area. The cause of that was multifactorial and included a lack of understanding of the risk presented by leaving the bay and a need for the staff to complete other urgent tasks due to the demand on ward staff.","On 20th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Marion Nickson. The investigation concluded on the 6th July 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of an accidental fall sustained when not observed in hospital exacerbated by necessary anticoagulation therapy and when an inpatient following a pneumothorax a complication of a necessary medical procedure.

She was triaged at 17:52. She presented with a history of vomiting and abdominal pain. She was triaged into Category 3 (urgent) which recommends clinical assessment within 60 minutes. She was not clinically assessed until 02:46 – 9 hours after her arrival. The delay was due to the demand on the department and was not unusual at that time. The abdomen was distended and guarded. A decision was made that she needed antibiotics and a CT scan. The antibiotics were not prescribed until 04:21 and administered at 04:50. The CT scan was ordered at 04:13. The delay was due to the clinical demands on the department. The scan took place at 05:11 and at 05:44 it was reported on. The scan showed a sigmoid colon perforation. She was referred to the surgical team who saw her at 06:50. A conservative treatment plan was put in place. She was moved to a surgical ward where she began to rapidly deteriorate with her NEWS 2 score rising to 16 at 08:55. Her NEWS 2 had been 1 at triage and 3 at 23:53 and 04:13. She died at Tameside General Hospital on 17th December just after 9am from peritonitis.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
The inquest heard evidence that the very significant delay for Mrs Oldham to be seen by a clinician was due to the demand on Emergency Department Services. The inquest was told that delays of this length (9 hours) for patients who had been triaged to be seen within 60 minutes were not uncommon throughout the winter period across Greater Manchester and more widely.
 
The demand was due to the volume of patients and the number of staff available to see and treat them. The delay was compounded by the shortage of radiographers and radiologists nationally meaning that even when a decision is taken for a scan it can take some time 9 an hour in this case) for it to take place and then reported on.
 
In the time that Mrs Oldham was waiting to be seen she deteriorated very significantly meaning that by the time it was understood what the issue was she was very unwell and did not respond to conservative treatment which was all she was well enough for by that point.",On 28th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Marianne Erika Oldham. The investigation concluded on the 6th June 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of a perforation of the sigmoid colon where the perforation was not identified until 12 hours after her arrival in the Emergency Department and treatment was delayed as a consequence. The medical cause of death was 1a) Peritonitis; 1b) Stercoral Perforation of Sigmoid Colon; 1c) Intra-abdominal Adhesions; II) Ischaemic Heart Disease,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14th September 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.      The inquest heard evidence that Mr Amesbury needed to be referred from secondary to tertiary services within Greater Manchester. The inquest heard evidence that the speed and quality of that referral was impacted by the way in which information was shared between clinicians in different trusts within Greater Manchester. The use of different systems and reliance on postal services and lack of a clear, effective electronic system of referrals including transfer of images /notes meant there were delays in assessing patients which led to a delay in formulating a treatment plan in tertiary services;
 
2. The evidence also indicated that there were delays in patients who had been identified as requiring cardiology input being seen in cardiology clinics due to availability of clinicians/appointment slots inquest. This was exacerbated where there was a need for trans- oesophageal echocardiogram due to resource issues. The inquest heard that this type of echocardiogram could be key in understanding the cardiac issues of a patient.","On 6th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Kevin Amesbury.

She returned to Tameside General Hospital with concerns over her wound. She subsequently developed a deep vein thrombosis and cellulitis. On 22nd November 2022 she became very unwell and was admitted to Intensive Care Unit with sepsis, acute kidney injury and liver failure. She was treated on the Intensive Care Unit until 26th November when she returned to the ward. She continued to be treated for her cellulitis and an ulcer of the left foot that had developed. She was stepped down to the Stamford Unit on 16th December 2022. On 22nd December 2022 she returned to Tameside General Hospital due to concerns about her raised NEWS 2 score, raised probably as a consequence of cellulitis. She was started on intravenous antibiotics. Her liver function was deranged and she had acute kidney injury. She had a catheter but her urine output was difficult to assess due to issues regarding possible catheter bypass. On 24th December, one dose of antibiotics was missed. On 25th December, two doses of antibiotics were missed. She continued to be unwell and on 27th December further antibiotics were prescribed. She was referred to the Critical Care Outreach Team who assessed and determined that Intensive Care Unit referral was not necessary. On 29th December the antibiotics were changed. There was a further referral to Critical Care Outreach that was unsuccessful as there were no staff available. There was no doctor to doctor assessment and no consultant review and no liver specialist advice sought or provided. She continued to deteriorate on 30th December with poor liver function and poor kidney function. On the morning of 31st December she deteriorated rapidly and was accepted by the Intensive Care Unit where despite aggressive treatment she deteriorated rapidly and died on 31st December 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1. Mrs Wadsworth missed three doses of antibiotics prescribed to treat her infection according to the evidence given to the inquest. This did not appear to have been escalated and there was no clear explanation regarding this occurring other than that her cannula may not have been in place and there was a delay in a doctor being available to reinsert one;
 
2. The evidence before the inquest was that on her admission over Christmas/New Year there was no effective consultant input into her care;
 
3. The junior doctor involved in her care felt that ICU involvement/input would be beneficial. The evidence was that there did not seem to be any doctor to doctor discussion of this. The inquest heard evidence that this was one way a patient could be transferred to ICU. It was unclear why there had not been such a discussion and whether in periods such as Christmas/ New Year where there were fewer consultants available the system worked effectively. This was not a situation where there had been a ward based ceiling of care put in place and ultimately Mrs Wadsworth was treated by ICU but was extremely unwell at that point and did not respond to that intervention at that point;
 
4. The alternative support available to ward based staff and possible route into ICU according to the evidence given at inquest was via the Critical Care Outreach team. That team is staffed primarily by nurses and its key focus is on presentation linked to NEWS2 scores according to the evidence given to the inquest. Mrs Wadsworth’s case was a complex one involving issues relating to her liver function and kidney function rather than just her NEWS2 scores and it was unclear if the Critical Care Outreach Team were best placed to assess her need for ICU support;
 
5. The inquest heard that on the date of one referral that team was not in any event available to the ward and the nurse who should have undertaken the role had been redeployed elsewhere in the trust and there was no capacity to fill that role;
 
6. Following her first admission to ICU there was a note that Mrs Wadsworth’s case should be discussed with a specialist Liver team. There was no evidence available to the inquest that such a discussion had taken place. It was not entirely clear on the evidence precisely which clinician was to take ownership of the action.","On 3rd January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jane Elizabeth Wadsworth .The investigation concluded on the 12th June 2023 and the conclusion was one of ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11th September 2023.

Inmy opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1. The GP practice uses EMIS for patient records and prescribing. From the evidence it appears that when one doctor ends a repeat prescription on EMIS, it remains in the ‘pending’ Medication Management box of the doctor to whom it was originally sent. Creating the risk, as in this case, that as a pending prescription it is actioned and issued instead of cancelled.
 
2. I heard evidence that the EMIS system appears to group prescriptions into the amount prescribed rather than simply recording when a prescription is issued. In this case there were different entries grouped as 100 tablets, 50 tablets, 30 tablets, and 24 tablets. Consequently, it was not clear to the duty doctor that the most recent prescriptions for co-codamol had been for a shorter course of only [REDACTED] tablets and as a result [REDACTED] tablets of co-codamol were prescribed and issued.
 
3. Evidence was given by the GP practice that to interrogate the EMIS system in order to ascertain what had actually been prescribed, issued and when, was a challenging task; it had taken 3 GPs and the in-house pharmacist to conduct the review.","An inquest into the death of Matthew William Thomas Power was opened on 29 September 2022 and resumed and concluded on 14 June 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe youhave the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 August 2023.

Jean Frickel had required an ambulance on 19 December 2022 due to symptoms of shortness of breath and confusion following a GP home visit. She was in reasonably poor health. A call was made by her husband to WAST at 17:09 hours. At 08.07 hours the following morning a further call was made informing WAST that Jean Frickel was unresponsive and not breathing. Paramedics arrived at 08:12 and confirmed that she had died. It took 13 hours and 3 minutes from the initial call for paramedics to arrive.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
There was evidence from WAST and BCUHB that improvements had been made internally within their organisations. It seems that patient flow i.e. those patients who are ready to be discharged from hospital but are unable to be discharged due to insufficiencies in social care means that ambulances are unable to offload patients into the Emergency Department which then causes the community delays as ambulances are not readily available.
 
I have not been presented with any meaningful evidence on the involvement of Local Authorities in the considerations by WAST and BCUHB of lack of patient flow due to social care deficiencies.
 
I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to BCUHB and WAST pertaining to the length of time it is taking for ambulances to arrive to patients (as well as handover at hospitals).
 
I remain significantly concerned that delays are continuing and that deaths will continue to occur into the future.
 
Specifically, I require responses to the following: 
1.      Extent of working relationship between WAST, BCU and North Wales Local Authorities to address the above issues; and

There were no complications during the surgery nor in her post- operative care leading to discharge to Ripley Rehabilitation Hospital where she arrived at about 23:00 on 22 June. Because she arrived so late and out of core hours, she did not have the benefit of the full and usual assessments and she had also been waiting for the transfer for some significant time at the general hospital in its discharge lounge.   ","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: –
1.  Jean had spent a lengthy period in the general hospital discharge lounge, during which time which she would not have had close checks and observations as compared to ward- based care. She did not arrive at the rehabilitation hospital until late at night and so did not have the usual core admission assessments. Such situations appear to me to have the potential to place patients such as Jean at significant risk. Given that there would usually be three parties involved in the transfer (the discharging hospital, the transporting ambulance service, and the discharge destination) there is opportunity for consideration of protocols to ensure such discharge arrangements are safe and appropriate.
 
2. Jean had signs of infection to the surgical site on arrival at the rehabilitation hospital and should have had more robust clinical review but confirmation of infection and referral back to the general hospital did not occur until her blood results were reviewed 3 days later. There had been opportunity to expedite the blood results. On the evidence at inquest there is reason to think that the rehabilitation staff were falsely reassured by a low NEWS score whereas there was suspected infection that could have been confirmed earlier.","On 05 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alice Jean FOX aged 90.

The court found that rider error on the part of Kaius was the cause of the collision, contributed to by the faded road markings and a visibility issue at the collision location.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

In summary, Amelia’s mother had a routine pregnancy and was given a due date of 01 December 2020. She attended Peterborough City Hospital at around 1030 hours on 5 December 2020.
 
2. From very early on, the CTG trace was classified as suspicious on a number of occasions and on some occasions as pathological. Evidence and a report from HSIB confirms that assessment and decision making during this period was appropriate.
 
3. Due to a failure to progress in the second stage of labour and suspected fetal compromise at around 0240 hours, a decision was made for a Category 2 Caesarean section delivery.
 
The CTG trace was stopped at 0404 hours to enable the Caesarean to take place.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN ARE:
1. While I heard evidence that there has been training for Midwives on how to take cord blood, and I was provided with a copy of a poster that was said to have been in use at the Trust for some time, in April 2023, over 2 years after this delivery, the Midwife gave evidence that she and her colleagues were of the opinion that it was appropriate to take a sample from anywhere in the cord, not just in the clamped area. The expert and the Trust’s own Head of Midwifery advised that this was not appropriate. It therefore does not appear that the learning has been passed on to all Trust Midwives and there is a risk that in future cases those treating the baby will be falsely reassured by normal cord pH results which may not be accurate.
 
While I read evidence of some training that had been provided in response to HSIB recommendations for further training on auscultation in addition to saturation monitoring and ECG monitoring during resuscitation, the independent expert also recommended training on UVC and IO access. I am also concerned that there does not appear to have been training in relation to the provision of blood transfusions in such cases to ensure that all potential reversible causes are treated before resuscitation stops. The Head of Midwifery who attended the inquest to advise on issues relating to the recommendations was not in a position to provide evidence on the neonatal position and I have been provided with no evidence by the Trust that these issues have been considered. I am concerned that they require further action.","On 14 October 2021 an investigation in to the death of Amelia Barbosa was commenced. Amelia died on 13 December 2020, aged 7 days.

She had a period of care at KMH CCU, but had to be transferred to Burton Hospital on 22.3.22 as KMH CCU was at operational capacity. She continued to make good progress on the CCU at Burton Hospital, but there were continuing issues of difficult airway management.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows 
 ·       There is limited evidence to date for the introduction and continuing use of comprehensive airway strategies, with structured planning and preparation, when a difficult airway is anticipated. There should be airway plans A, B, and C recorded, shared, and the equipment and skills to carry them out must be available
·       There is limited evidence to date for the universal use of the NAP4 algorithms and checklists, which should be available on the difficult airway trolley, and be familiar to all ICU nursing and medical staff, and to the wider anaesthetic team
 
·       There is limited evidence to date, for the robust daily checking of all necessary equipment on the difficult airway trolley, to ensure immediate replacement of all key equipment if it is broken or misplaced
 
·       The Mortality Review policy was not followed, leading to a significant delay in completing the serious incident review, delaying Trust learning, and delaying the family’s understanding of the circumstances of Jodie’s death. There is limited evidence of progress in implementing the national Patient Safety Incident Response Framework at the Trust

He had had several other spinal operations before then. He developed infection and abscesses, and the evidence showed that the most likely origin of that infection was the surgery that he had in January. He died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital on the 3rd March 2022.
 
As part of the investigation, I reviewed the medical records. These included medical records from the time of his surgery at Spire Hospital in Portsmouth, but also included outpatient appointments (as a private patient) with [REDACTED] on (inter alia) 29th December 2021 (by telephone), 26th January 2022, and 23rd February 2022.
 
My investigation revealed that [REDACTED] made no formal medical records of the outpatient appointments. It is right to point out that [REDACTED] letters dictated and typed up by his secretary (to the patient and his GP), and some of this correspondence is relatively detailed. It was advanced on his behalf that this correspondence effectively represents a medical record and it is entirely appropriate to make ‘records’ in this way.
 
I did not accept that this correspondence is as full as a medical record would be. Much of the correspondence relates predominantly to plans and proposed courses of action, rather than a record of the patient’s condition at that time.
 
In questioning, [REDACTED] accepted that much of the further information which he gave at the inquest (and referred to in a witness statement) is not recorded anywhere other than his own personal memory.
 
Even leaving aside GMC requirements in relation to record-keeping, it is plainly the case that records are important for patient safety, and storing information about a patient in an individual doctor’s memory is clearly unacceptable. Leaving aside the issue of protection for the clinician, this approach carries a risk for patients.
 
I was clear at the inquest that I had no reason to disbelieve the additional evidence which [REDACTED] brought to the inquest – both in his oral evidence in court and in his witness statement – but I am concerned about the risks of this continued approach for other patients. In questioning, [REDACTED] clarified that his intention is to continue practising in this way.","The issue about which I have concern is clear.
 
[REDACTED] should review his record-keeping approach, perhaps with the benefit of legal advice and reference to GMC guidance. An approach of ‘storing’ information in an individual clinician’s memory carries a risk (including a risk of death) for future patients.","I conducted an inquest into the death of Peter William Frederick Lawrence, which concluded on 15th March 2023.

20/04/2023,2023-0128,Joseph Maunick,Peter Taheri,Suffolk,Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths,Department of Health and Social Care and NHS England,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/joseph-maunick-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Joseph-Maunick-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0128_Published.pdf,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/2023-0128-Response-from-NHS-England.pdf,"Joseph Willy Maunick (Will) was an intelligent man, gifted with communication skills, who worked as a teacher and spoke multiple languages. In his later years he developed cognitive impairment, which in turn led to him being at very high risk of falls. This risk, in relation to which he needed constant supervision, was known to those caring for him and to those responsible for looking after him when he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was admitted to the hospital Emergency Department not because he himself was experiencing a medical emergency, but as a last resort after exhaustive efforts to explore all options before Will was admitted to hospital: it proved not to be possible to find suitable alternative care for him in residential care placements while his wife, and main carer, underwent unplanned emergency major surgery.
 
The inquest heard evidence that, prior to his admission to hospital, at least eight social care providers were contacted plus further residential homes, but none of them could provide emergency care for Will. The inquest heard undisputed evidence that this was an instance of a national care shortage.
 
The inquest heard evidence that in an Emergency Department where many patients are suffering medical emergencies constant one-to-one supervision will not always be possible. I found as a fact that it was not possible on this occasion and that Will’s fall in the Emergency Department took place when the nursing assistant who was trying to maintain constant one-to-one supervision of Will insofar as possible had their attention momentarily diverted to another patient experiencing a medical emergency. I judged that it would not be just to describe this as a failure on the part of the nursing assistant or the Emergency Department staff.
 
The reason why it was not an individual failure included that the inquest heard evidence that the hospital, and in particular the Emergency Department, was experiencing significant pressures associated with high demand and an internal critical incident had been declared. There was a high demand for beds within the hospital without the availability of beds to meet the demand. This included the facts that there were, at the time of Will’s arrival in the Emergency Department, 50 patients in the Emergency Department, of whom 32 were waiting for bed placement. Moreover, staffing was at a ‘black status’ (the worst level) across the hospital, with a deficiency of staff of around 60 nurses and nursing assistants.
 
I found as a fact that those severe pressures – the high demand levels and the deficiency of staff and scarcity of resource – contributed to the death. Firstly, if it had been possible to care for and supervise Will on a constant basis as he needed, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.
 
Secondly, on the balance of probabilities, the scarcity of resource relative to demand contributed to Will not being transferred to a ward – or other more appropriate environment – sooner.
 
Apart from the inherent particular difficulties in providing constant supervision in an Emergency Department referred to above, the inquest also received undisputed evidence that the environment of a busy, noisy Emergency Department, with lights on at all hours of the day and night would be overly stimulating and not the most suitable environment for someone with cognitive impairment who was experiencing confusion and agitation. I found that such an environment probably contributed to Will’s inclination to wander and so to his fall.
 
If it had been possible to transfer Will to a more suitable environment sooner, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.
 
I found as a fact that, on the balance of probabilities, the lack of availability of more appropriate care contributed to the death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1)  A national care shortage contributed to a situation where a gentleman who was not experiencing a medical emergency, but who required constant supervision for his own safety in view of his cognitive impairment and very high falls risk, could not be cared for anywhere other than in a hospital Emergency Department. If there is not sufficient provision of care, including residential care placements, such that those in similar need do not receive suitable care, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths will occur or continue to exist in the future, when they are placed in an environment that is not realistically able to provide the constant supervision needed, as occurred in this case.
 
The severe pressures on the hospital, including the Emergency Department, were such that they were experiencing scarcity of resource relative to demand and a severe deficiency of staff. In these circumstances, it was both not possible to provide the care and supervision that Will needed in the Emergency Department, and the scarcity of resource contributed to Will not being transferred sooner to a ward or other more appropriate environment, where Will could receive the constant supervision that would probably have prevented the fall that led to his death. The evidence was that the scarcity of resource experienced was a challenge on the national level, rather than just a particular local issue. If hospitals, including Emergency Departments, do not receive sufficient resource, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths, due to an inability to provide the required care and / or prompt transfer to an available ward bed or appropriate alternative place, will occur or continue to exist in the future.","On 18th March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Joseph Willy Maunick.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th April 2023. The narrative conclusion of the inquest was that:   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe each of you and / or your organisations have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15 June 2023.

The family member called the emergency services and ambulance service personnel attended. The first response paramedic tried to elicit the history, but was unable to determine from Mrs Robinson what medication had been taken. There was a delay in conveying Mrs Robinson to hospital, in the order of around 50 minutes, but there is no evidence that this delay contributed to her death. Mrs Robinson was taken to Queen’s Hospital where a diagnosis of mixed drug toxicity, on the background of severe co-morbidities, was made. She was provided with intensive care. Sadly she did not recover and she passed away at Queen’s Hospital on the 8 May 2022. By way of background, Mrs Robinson had taken an overdose in March 2022 and had received care from the mental health home treatment team. On the 25 April 2022 she was discharged back to the care of the general practitioner. She was not assessed by a doctor in the home treatment team before her discharge and she did not receive a comprehensive risk assessment in the days leading up to her discharge. Whilst such assessments and reviews should have taken place, it is not possible to conclude that they would have prevented her death. It is noted that there were no documented concerns about her mental health between the 26 April and the 6 May 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The collision occurred when the deceased pulled out of a side road, Pittington Road, into the path of a vehicle travelling in the outside lane of the A690.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
During the course of the Inquest evidence was heard from the lead road traffic collision investigator in the case that there are significant concerns in relation to the adequacy and layout of this particular junction and the five other junctions on this stretch of road (A690). Evidence was given that since this fatality, there has been another fatal road traffic collision on the 22/12/22, at the junction directly opposite. Further that between 11/01/00 and 31/12/22 there have been 21 collisions at this junction (including this fatality and 3 other serious collisions) and that there have been 29 collisions at the other junctions on this stretch of road (including one further fatality and 6 other serious collisions).
 
The concerns in relation to this junction, and the other junctions relate to:-
1.  The volume of traffic that the junctions must manage.
2.  The complexity of traffic movement at the junctions.
3.  The speed limit in the vicinity of the junctions.
 
Concerns were also raised in relation to the planned extensive expansion/development of the area in the vicinity of the junction, including increased housing development, a proposed retail park, football site, as well as developments occurring more widely in the area which will lead to increased traffic, and that any proposed improvements to the junction are not required until prior to the occupation of the 39th dwelling on the site. The concern is that the proposals to improve the safety of the junction are not sufficient nor timely, and that consideration does not appear to have been given to reducing the speed limit within the junction series. A further concern was raised that the proposed improvements to the junction considered this junction in isolation, and did not consider the series of junctions on this
stretch of road.","On 12/07/2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Kelly Nicola DUNNE. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20/02/2023.

Mr Parsons had spent the evening of Friday 22 April 2022 at the Porthleven Food Festival. He had been due to meet up with his wife at a rented holiday cottage in Porthleven on the morning of Saturday 23 April 2022. He failed to meet her as planned and was uncontactable.
 
The police search revealed that Mr Parsons was last seen just before midnight on 22 April 2022 by a witness in the in the big tent at the harbour. The witness stated that Mr Parsons did not seem to be drunk at the time that they were speaking.
 
On 4 May 2022 the fully clothed body of Mr Parsons was recovered from the sea, approximately 4 miles off the coast of the Isles of Scilly after being spotted by a fisherman.
 
The post-mortem revealed no injuries and gave the cause of death identified above. Toxicology shows raised urine ethanol (alcohol) at 291 mg / 100 ML. For comparison, the legal driving limit alcohol in urine is 107 mg / 100 ML urine.
 
The Inquest findings were as follows
·       Mr Parsons died after midnight, on 23 April 2023 after falling into the harbour waters and drowning.
·       Due to Mr Parsons body being located fully clothed, he fell into the water by accident and not through choice.
That if Mr Parsons was still conscious and was able to shout for help, he is unlikely to have been heard by anyone due to the noise of the ongoing events.
·       The alcohol consumed by Mr Parsons made it more likely that when entering the water this would increase the risk of drowning due to impairment of cognition and motor skills.
·       Police evidence revealed that the sea off Porthleven features a notorious current that means it is not safe to swim in the harbour.
·       The pier and harbour walls raised safety issues discussed below under matters of concern. The police evidence was that these safety issues amounted to a failing to ensure the safety of members of the public.
Responsibility for public safety rests with the Porthleven Harbour & Dock Company as the owners of the harbour, and with Cornwall Council as the licensing authority for the Food Festival.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

She was then taken to Wythenshawe Hospital. There was a delay in triage due to demands on the Emergency Department. Triage did not pick up on her being a potential silver trauma case. A CT scan was not ordered at that time. She was triaged to be seen within 1 hour. ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
1.     Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;
 
2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;
 
3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;
 
4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival.","On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson. The investigation concluded on the 12th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from injuries sustained in a road traffic collision where there was a delay in identifying the severity of the injuries sustained.

She went to a hospital in Bali where she deteriorated and died on the 24th July 2022 despite treatment. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. It was found that she had methanol in her system which had caused her death. Methanol is not meant for human consumption. She had inadvertently consumed methanol believing she had consumed alcohol.

The Inquest heard evidence that there is a growing problem of methanol being passed off as alcohol for human consumption particularly in places such as Bali. Methanol is used rather than ethanol in spirits aimed at the Western market and sold even through apparently reputable suppliers.
 
The evidence before the Inquest was that :
1.  Knowledge of the problem amongst the expatriate/tourist community was very low despite the increase in the problem and the catastrophic consequences of methanol consumption;
 
2.  There was little publicity by the UK Government of the risk in contrast to the approach taken by the Australian Government who had undertaken a campaign to increase awareness to protect their citizens travelling in areas of Asia such as Bali;
 
3.  The UK Government publicising information about the risk of methanol being used in local spirits, steps that could be taken by UK nationals travelling to reduce the risk and warning signs of methanol toxicity would help to reduce the chance of others dying in the way in which Kirsty McKie died","On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Margaret McKie.

Cattle in the field approached them, knocked them down and trampled them, causing serious injuries. Emergency treatment was provided by a doctor who arrived by helicopter. Mr Holmes could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 12:56 that day at the scene of the incident.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 
  
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   
1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. 
  
1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  
 
1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.
 
1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.
 
1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the ‘application’). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as “essential.”
 
1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest.

1. The ongoing pressures faced by the ambulance service are clearly multifactorial.

Resuscitation algorithm (4 H’s & 4 T’s)* for PEA cardiac arrest
 I heard evidence that the 4 H’s and 4 T’s should be considered and excluded in any PEA cardiac arrest situation. Steps were taken to treat anaphylaxis, but in the absence of any improvement in Teegan’s clinical condition, and whilst it was mentioned, no steps were taken to exclude possible bilateral tension pneumothoraces. Evidence was heard at the Inquest that it is the only one of the 4 H’s and 4 T’s (see footnote) that directly results in a sudden inability to ventilate, with the HSIB report indicating that there was sufficient time to consider and exclude this possibility given the length of time of the PEA cardiac arrest.
 
2. Surgical emphysem
There was a delay in the recognition of surgical emphysema by clinical attendees at the cardiac arrest (medical specialist registrar, consultant obstetricians, anaesthetic core trainee, anaesthetic specialist registrar and the on call consultant anaesthetist) despite indicative clinical signs of deep cyanosis, gross whole body swelling with the need to remove the increasingly constrictive hospital wrist band and endotracheal tube tie, alongside sub-cutaneous crepitus and an abdominal drainage bag noted to be tense with air.
 
3. Investigation after Teegan’s death
Following this incident, and despite Teegan being intubated and ventilated at the time, with a real possibility of this being an anaesthetic related event, no steps were taken by the anaesthetic department at St Richard’s Hospital, Chichester, either before or after the publication of the HSIB report, to explore potential iatrogenic or other anaesthetic related causes (such as exposure of Teegan’s lungs to excessive volume or pressure) as a possible or probable cause of Teegan’s death.
 
Furthermore, the anaesthetic machine/ventilator was not taken out of service and assessed to see if there was a fault. Neither was the data from the anaesthetic machine downloaded and interrogated, which may have assisted in establishing how Teegan came to develop bilateral tension pneumothoraces during her emergence from general anaesthesia.
 
The failure of the anaesthetic department to undertake any morbidity or mortality review/meeting following Teegan’s death led to a lost opportunity to share any possible learning opportunities both within and outside their department to prevent future deaths, and as a corollary to have been in a position to fully assist both the investigation by the HSIB and the inquest hearing.
 
4. Trust Clinical Governance procedures
The senior management team within the Trust have not acknowledged that there was a lack of a proper and robust system in place to trigger an investigation into all the circumstances of the death of a 17-year-old patient, with no steps taken by them to do so either before or after the publication of the HSIB report or at any time prior to the Inquest hearing.
 
This gives rise to a concern of a lack of insight within the senior management team of the importance of undertaking a comprehensive investigation into unexpected deaths within their organisation and for there to be wider dissemination of any institutional learning with the aim of preventing future deaths.
 
The failure of the Trust to fully investigate how Teegan came by her death also gives rise to a concern regarding the Trust’s obligation to comply with the Statutory Duty of Candour and their requirement to share their findings with both the regulators and Teegan’s family as well as to indicate the steps, if any, they have taken to prevent future deaths.","On 7th January 2022 I resumed an investigation into the death of Teegan Marie Barnard.
