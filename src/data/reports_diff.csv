Ian fell so that he landed in front of the toilet block in the car park, suffering very serious injuries. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted at the scene by lifeguards and off duty doctors, before being conveyed to RCHT by ambulance. Ian was examined at hospital and found to have sustained multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs.\n \nOn 4 June 2022, Ian was transferred to Derriford Hospital for treatment of complex spinal fractures, under the neurosurgical team.\n \nOn 5 June 2022 Ian suffered a medical episode which developed into a critical incident in which Ian deteriorated rapidly and required life saving measures.\n \nOn 6 June 2022 Ian was taken to theatre for spinal surgery. Before surgery, the critical care flexible endotracheal tube was replaced by an armoured tube. After surgery, the anaesthetic team commenced an airway exchange, namely removing the armoured tube which had been inserted for the operation, in order to replace it with the more flexible critical care tube. However, having removed the armoured tube, the team were unable to insert the flexible tube despite repeated attempts. Ian then started to desaturate due to lack of oxygen. The Consultant Anaesthetist proceeded to jet ventilate Ian, the first jet was uneventful, the second resulted in massive neck swelling, Ian went into cardiac arrest. The medical team then resorted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency tracheostomy. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 20-25 minutes During this time Ian suffered hypoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen.\n \nOver the following days, Ian suffered seizures on the intensive care unit and an MRI on 9 June 2022 showed extensive changes consistent with hypoxic brain injury.\n \nOn 15 June 2022, Ian’s care was transitioned to end–of-life care.\n \nIan died in the intensive care unit at Derriford hospital at 17:10 on 15 June 2022.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nThere was an error of omission in record keeping and in handover from critical care to surgery, and that this error likely contributed to Ian’s death.\nThere was no entry in Ian’s hospital notes to indicate the full extent of the critical incident of 5 June 2022.\nThere was a lack of information on handover from critical care to the surgical team regarding the full extent of the critical incident of the 5 June 2022. There was a verbal handover which was brief and vague. There was no formal written handover process highlighting significant events.\nThe error of omission was unexplained and has not been investigated by the NHS. The evidence regarding the error of omission came to light after the completion of the NHS investigation into Ian’s death. The Consultant Anaesthetist involved in Ian’s operation discovered the fact of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 on a later examination of ventilator data. The data indicated that Ian deteriorated significantly, that he was close to a cardiac arrest and the critical care team saved his life.\nThe surgical and anaesthetic team had no reason to suspect a secondary brain injury. The team had no information on Ian’s neurological status. Ian is likely to have suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the critical incident of 5th June. This will have undermined his resilience and ability to physically withstand the rigors of spinal surgery and airway exchange.\nHad the surgical and anaesthetic team known of the extent of the critical incident of 5 June, the operation would have been delayed and further tests and assessments undertaken. The anaesthetic team may have opted for elective tracheostomy if the full circumstances of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 had been known. An elective tracheostomy would have led to\na different outcome because it would have avoided the complications that ensued from the attempted airway exchange.\nI note the NHS Investigator and the Investigatory Panel both recommended that action is required for the handover of complex patients. The panel recommended as follows:\nMore robust and formalised handover of complex patients before transfer to theatre, to include review of airway management, cardiopulmonary status, potential avenues of deterioration and any significant events during admission\nThe Trust had chosen not to accept this recommendation but at the time the Trust made that decision it was not aware of the extent and significance of the error of omission.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 7 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of 51 year old Ian Jacka.

She took up residency on discharge from hospital where she had had an inpatient stay as a result of a fall in the community.\n \nOn becoming a resident of Ashley House Barbara had a known diagnosis of dementia, which sometimes affected her memory. She was at a high risk of falling and had blurred vision. All in all, she was a relatively frail elderly woman with known risks around her mobility and she relied on others to keep her safe.\n \nBarbara was the only resident with a bedroom on the first floor of Ashley House. This could only be accessed via the stairs (which Barbara was incapable of ascending or descending safely) or the mechanically operated stairlift (which Barbara was not permitted to use unattended or unsupervised.)\n \nOn the evening of the 8th of August 2022 two carers were on duty; neither of whom were native English speaking nationals; one was Romanian and the other was Indian.\n \nI was told that in order to be able to work in the UK, those requiring a Visa (as the two carers on duty did) must prove that they can read, write, speak and understand English to at least Level B1…. [that they must demonstrate that they] can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work”. Applicants for a Visa must have passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT).\n \nIt transpired during the Inquest that one of the workers on the evening of the 8th August 2022 had never passed the SELT, so was not qualified or permitted to work in the UK.\n \nAt 19:27 one of the carers called 999 to request an ambulance. It was clear, on the evidence, that Barbara had been left unattended on the mechanical chair for around five minutes. This was clearly contrary to the rules and procedures of Ashley House. During those five minutes she has left the seat of the mechanically operated stairlift (possibly unfastening the seat belt) and proceeded to climb the stairs; which she was unable to safely, due to do physical limitations and her underlying cognitive impairment.\n \nShe has fallen on the stairs, falling downwards. There were no witnesses to this incident but Barbara has been found, having fallen awkwardly, landing with her head trapped under the chair for the mechanically operated stairlift. Care staff were unable to free her because of the positioning and angle at which she was entrapped within the mechanics.\n \nOn calling 999 (copies of both recordings were played at the Inquest) it was obvious that neither of the care staff were sufficiently proficient in English to be able to:\nExplain clearly the nature of the medical emergency. An internal audit by the ambulance service revealed that the call-handler had selected an incorrect pathway. The correct pathway that should have been selected was “entrapment” but at no time during the call did the carer give any\ninformation that would have indicated that this was the presenting problem. The carer repeated used the word “blocked” which added no assistance, clarity of explanation of the events that were unfolding.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing”. This made any meaningful triage of Barbara’s condition virtually impossible. The call handler followed the script to ask if the patient was conscious and breathing (i.e. to ascertain clinical emergency and determination of a priority response) but this assessment was severely hampered given the carer did not appear to know or understand the difference between bleeding and breathing.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “alert” and “alive”, which presented all of the same problems as referred in in (ii) above.\n \nParamedics arrived on a category 2 response and, on arrival, it was clear that Barbara was beyond medical help. She was pronounced deceased at the scene.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Vulnerable people, by very definition, are unable to often appreciate the need for help; take steps to keep themselves safe and/or summon help for themselves when they need it.\n \nBy being unable to speak the native language of England with any proficiency I am concerned that deaths will continue to arise where those who are young, disabled, suffering from a mental impairment or who are elderly and in need of urgent medical help will not have this summoned for them if those who are engaging with emergency professionals are unable to communicate effectively.\n \nThe Court looked at evidence of the B1 English test. Examples from the paper were as follows:\n“I                      that book last year” (options are bought, have bought, had bought)\n“The town,                  is very beautiful, has lots of parks” (options are which, where, what).\nThis level of comprehension is comparable to a KS2 curriculum being studied by Year 6 students sitting their SATS exam and appears to be wholly insufficient for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people, as demonstrated in this case by carers who were alone (i.e. no English speaking members of staff on duty) being unable to explain to medical professionals the presenting condition of the patient.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Jean Rymell, aged 91 (“Barbara”).

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\nProbation Service (PS) offender records and documents.\n \nThe inquests identified that very concerning information regarding Damien Bendall was made known to the PS (including violent assault and injury of a partner, and an incident of possible child sexual abuse) but was not recorded clearly or prominently for subsequent PS practitioners to read and evaluate in risk assessment and decision- making, and indeed was not read at key and critical points. Although this was in part due to the recording made by individual PS practitioners it was also the result of confusing proformas (e.g. the OASys misleading drop-down boxes and the open and closed sections), imprecise arrangements and expectations of how and where such information should be recorded, and where checks should be directed and made when the records needed to be reviewed. The inquests were informed of current PS expectations for recording offender risk information and assessments, but I remain very unsure that there are clear and efficient recording arrangements and systems to ensure that risk information is accurate, prominent, easily seen, and easily updateable by PS practitioners.\n \nPS domestic abuse (DA) and child safeguarding (SG) checks\n \nThe inquests identified that DA and SG checks were either insufficient or wholly lacking at various stages of Damien Bendall’s offender management. The current evidence is that DA and SG checks remain generally insufficient or are not being done with consequent on-going risks to children and women.\n \nInsufficient or absent PS DA and SG checks has been a theme of HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and reviews for at least the last 5 years. On HM Inspectorate of Probation case sampling to determine whether domestic abuse and child safeguarding enquiries were being undertaken when indicated, the HM Inspectorate of Probation Annual Report for 2022/2023 states at page 38: –\n \nwhere inspectors judged that these enquiries needed to be made by the probation practitioner, child safeguarding enquiries were carried out in 55 per cent of cases, domestic abuse enquiries were only carried out in 49 per cent of cases and risk of harm was only properly addressed in 39 per cent.\n \nThe PS is not currently conducting SG checks in all cases where an offender will live with or have access to children.\n \nThe PS has mandated that in all cases where a curfew condition is proposed to the court in a pre-sentence report (PSR) DA and SG checks will be conducted prior to the proposal and submission of the PSR: this is not being done in all cases. I am also unclear whether contact to the address homeowner/lead tenant for a potential curfew condition to discuss the suitability of a curfew condition is being undertaken in all cases.\n \nRelatedly, although I have not taken evidence on this wider issue, it appears to me that the systems for conducting DA and SG checks are generally severely strained. I say this because as an example the PS has now employed staff to make the checks from police records and has had to do this because the police service itself is unable to check and provide the information to the PS within necessary timeframes.\n \nPS PSR reports\n \nThere is no evidence that DA and SG checks were made by the PS practitioner in respect of Damien Bendall’s PSR report. Via the report the court was informed that checks had been conducted. The PS practitioner put forward a curfew provision as appropriate and the report was written in such a way to indicate that the report writer had checked the suitability of the curfew address, when she had not in fact done so. Had the court not been misled it is unlikely that the court’s disposal would have included a curfew requirement.\n \nThe inquests heard that PSRs written by the same PS practitioner, reviewed before her submission of Damien Bendall’s PSR, and reports reviewed after the murders, also lacked evidence of DA and SG checks having been made even though they were stated to have been done in the reports.\n \nEvidence from senior PS staff was to the effect that failing to undertake the checks and failure to make this explicitly clear in a PSR might be dealt with by management feedback to the PS practitioner but is an unlikely to be a disciplinary matter. This leads me to question whether, given the potentially very disastrous outcomes in terms of public protection, the PS is failing to grasp the seriousness of the issue, to make this explicit to PS practitioners, and ensure that there are commensurate penalties for staff where these professional duties have been breached.\n \nPS DA and SG training\n \nA significant issue in the inquests was the fact that the very inexperienced staff who were (wrongly) allocated Damien Bendall’s case on transfer to the East Midlands PS region had insufficient DA and SG training. The PS states it has introduced more robust DA and SG training, but it is unclear whether PS practitioners are receiving this before cases are allocated to them to manage.\n \nReporting concerns to the PS by the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS)\n \nDamien Bendall made the comment “if this relationship goes bad I’ll murder my girlfriend and the children” to the EMS field operative who fitted his tag and monitoring equipment but this was not reported back by the field operative to her manager nor to the PS. EMS has stated that it has introduced relevant training but the inquest heard evidence from the field operative that comments made by offenders which can be interpreted as potentially posing risk are currently routinely not being reported back by EMS field operatives.\n \nThe inquests examined the relevant contract terms between the Ministry of Justice and Capita (EMS) relating to reporting concerns and there did appear to be lack of clarity on reporting mechanisms and issues to report.\n \nNotification of missed substance misuse appointments to the PS\n \nIn Derbyshire the substance misuse services provided to offenders where there is a court-imposed sentence requirement for such services is provided under the auspices of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS FT. Damien Bendall was subject to an alcohol treatment requirement. The precise number is not clear on the records, but he missed 4 or 5 appointments with the service between 21 July and his first attended appointment on 17 September 2021, but the required proforma attendance/non-attendance forms were not sent by the substance misuse service to notify the PS.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 23 September 2021 I commenced investigations into the deaths of Terri Liz Harris aged 35, her children John-Paul Bennett and Lacey Bennett, aged 13 and 11 respectively, and their friend Connie Gent aged 11.

The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the\nreport until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022.

The lack of communication between these teams meant that timely sharing of results did not occur. Even the very knowledge of the fact that a CT scan had taken place would have alerted the endoscopist to check those results, and it is likely that the second endoscopy would not have gone ahead. I understand this to be a national issue and is likely to apply to other investigations being carried out.\n \n(2)  That the reporting timeframes on the 2-week urgent cancer pathway referral does not take into account timeframes for reporting investigative procedures or subsequent review by the referring clinicians.\n \n(3)  The current training for Endoscopists for JAG certification requires the performance\nof 200 endoscopies.

The call was allocated a C2 category which aims to have an urgent response within an 18 minute time frame. The EEAS was extremely busy that night with previously unseen levels of C2 allocations of ambulances. In addition, the hospitals in the area were queuing ambulances outside ED’s because they were unable to offload patients and then proceed to other calls. That combination meant that despite being allocated an urgent response time Mr Vincent was effectively left on the floor for a very prolonged time. Ultimately he had a cardiac arrest at home and an ambulance attended promptly. He was resuscitated but the “down time” was prolonged.

Mr Gale was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was seen regularly by mental health professionals and was in frequent contact with mental health services. Those services were provided by Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Gale was compliant with his medication and engaged with services. He was well supported by his family and friends.\n \nMr Gale’s anxiety continued during his engagement with mental health services. Evidence was heard about what caused Mr Gale’s anxiety. One ongoing feature was his application for Universal Credit.\n \nOn 2 March 2023, 2 days before his death, Mr Gale was seen by an Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the inquest. The Psychiatrist considered Mr Gale’s anxiety was exacerbated by his application for Universal Credit. During Mr Gale’s appointment, the Psychiatrist called the benefits office for help but the call was not answered before the end of the consultation. Mr Gale was expecting a call from a DWP representative the next day (3 March).\n \nOn 3 March 2022 at approximately 11:00 am, Mr Gale spoke to the duty Registered Mental Health Nurse. He remained very anxious and his main concern was the application for Universal Credit.\n \nDuring their evidence, the Associate Specialist Psychiatrist expressed concerns about the experience of mental health service users with DWP. These concerns were not just specific to Mr Gale.\n \nEvidence was also given by the Trust’s Group Nurse Director (a Registered Mental Health Nurse) who considered that the issues identified by the Psychiatrist were national. The Director considered it important to address these issues as they were debilitating for service users.\n \nThe Director advised that the Trust’s Crisis Team had started a food bank 3 years ago to support service users. The Director was also aware that the DWP had been invited to the Cumbria Suicide Prevention Group.\n \nI stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Gale’s death and his anxiety about his Universal Credit application.

He did not simply arrive at hospital,  but   had been assessed and then sent there by his GP, who felt, rightly as it turned out, that Derek may have developed an obstruction. He was anticipating   Derek would be seen quickly.\n \n·      He arrived at the Emergency Department, and handed in some paperwork at reception and understandably expected he would not have to wait long to be assessed by doctors who he knew were expecting him.\n \n·      No-one called for him for almost two hours by which time he had died.\n \n·      It is correct to say that once a post mortem examination was performed, it was clear that even if he had been assessed immediately upon arrival at hospital his condition was such that surgical intervention was not a realistic possibility and the condition was going to prove terminal.\n \n·      At the time Derek arrived, as the Hospital Trust’s own internal review of this death explained, such were the pressures on the hospital Trust posed by patient numbers that it was operating at OPEL [Operations Pressure Escalation Level] 4. This is a method used by the NHS to measure the stress, demands, and pressure a hospital is under. OPEL 4 represents the highest level, when a hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient\nsafety is at risk”.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \n·      Concern 1 – that the medical professionals who work in a hospital emergency department are routinely expected to do so when the OPEL 4 applies, a recognition they are performing their roles when the hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient safety is at risk”. Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.\n \n·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for. There is a clear risk that puts patients at risk and it would be remiss of me not to raise it.\n \n·      Concern 3 – Finally, it is relevant to point out that Derek had not moved for    some time before a medical professional called for Derek.  I  formed the  view that there had been a reluctance on his Friend’s part to request assistance due   to the pressures staff were clearly under, but also because he had already  handed in Derek’s paperwork and was expecting some assistance imminently which did not arrive. I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""The death of Harold Derek PEDLEY Otherwise known as Derek PEDLEY on 21.12.22 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th August 2023.   ""},""action"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.""},""response"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

On the 19 December 2022 he was stepped down from intensive care to a ward. He was at a very high risk of developing a thromboembolism due to his cancer diagnosis, recent surgery, lengthy period in hospital and immobility.

The reason for refusal is unclear and there is no documented evidence that the risk of non-compliance with the medication was explained to him or escalated to the medical team. On the 20 January 2023, Mr. James suffered from an acute deterioration in his health, culminating in a cardiac arrest.

The administration of anti-coagulation medication to patients like Mr James, is vital for reducing the risk of a venous thrombo-embolism, a potentially life-threatening condition. There is no electronic prompt/alert to highlight to the medical team when prescribed anticoagulation medication is not administered.\n \nThe Trust’s internal investigator recognised that a fail-safe should be put in place within the electronic records, to ensure escalation to the medical team where doses of prescribed anti- coagulation are not administered.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nEvidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:\n \n1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.\n \n2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.\n \n3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.\n \n4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.\n \n5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.\n \n6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.\n \n7.  Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.\n \n8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.\n \n9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.\n \n10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.\n \nThe summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021 [REDACTED].\n \nThe investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.\n \nI made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:\n \n1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n \n2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.\n \n3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.\n \n4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.\n \n5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.\n \n6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.\n \n7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.\n \n8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.\n \n9.  At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased’s home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021.""},""action"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.""},""response"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4th August 2023.

She had recently been diagnosed with hypertension which was being treated with atenolol. She was also taking hormone replacement therapy. \nii.) For the previous 5 years she had been using a Decathlon Easybreath full face snorkel mask when on holiday. \niii.) On the 13th January 2020 she was snorkelling using the full face mask when she expressed concerns and was accompanied back to the beach. She collapsed and died. \niv.) Expert evidence at the inquest identified immersion pulmonary oedema as the cause of the death. This is caused by the build-up of fluid in the lungs as a result of an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure caused by water pressure when the chest is submerged. This is exacerbated by hypertension and hormone replacement therapy. Negative pressure in the lungs causes fluid from the blood vessels to be drawn into the lungs. \nv.) The use of a full face snorkel mask contributed to the death in two ways: \na.) because negative pressure in the lungs is increased as a result of the increased effort of breathing caused by inhalation through the snorkel tube and mask, and \nb.) because respiratory effort is increased by the inhalation of elevated carbon dioxide levels caused by inhaling air drawn through a dead space in the mask.\nBoth exacerbate the negative pressure in the lungs and increase the effects of immersion pulmonary oedema.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\nAwareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession:\ni.) Concerns were raised by the medical witnesses that there is very little awareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession and that it is not addressed in medical training, as a consequence, it can be missed by those treating the condition and is often mistaken for drowning.\n \nThe Full Face Mask\n \nii.) At the time that the Easybreath full face snorkel mask was developed by Decathlon there were no United Kingdom or European Standards which were applicable to a full face snorkelling mask.\niii.) In the course of its development, Decathlon commissioned a number of tests to be undertaken on it, but it was accepted in evidence that the tests undertaken did not replicate the conditions of the use of the mask by the general public.\niv.) Decathlon have sold over 16 million of the masks. Other such masks are also on the market.\nv.) The Decathlon usage instructions for the full face mask, contained in small print, have been amended over time. From the 17th August 2015 the instructions included a warning that you must make sure that you are in good physical condition before snorkelling and that the mask is not suitable for swimming.\nvi.) Further tests were undertaken and an Ergomedical report considered the issue of whether use of the mask and inhalation through the mask’s dead space gave rise to excess carbon dioxide inhalation. The report concluded “we strongly recommend to advise against wearing Easybreath masks to people who suffer from underlying cardio-respiratory conditions.”\nvii.) As a result, Decathlon amended their instructions for use to include that the mask should not be used if the user has unstable cardio-respiratory pathologies, that the mask is to be used under conditions of submaximal exercise (mild to moderate) and that it is not suitable for active swimming.\nviii.) Development of a United Kingdom standard in relation to this type of mask is now being put in train but has not yet begun and is likely to take some time.\nix.) Decathlon have recently updated their website in the United Kingdom to include the following, “It is not recommended to use this product if you have any ongoing respiratory or cardiovascular issues including but not limited to chest infection, asthma, high/raised blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease or angina etc. If you have any doubts or questions relating to this please check with your medical practitioner.” The same additional wording is being translated and added to all websites of the company.\nx.) The packaging of the mask has been revised to show a pictogram to warn against use of the mask by those with heart or other cardiovascular conditions.\nxi.) The concern is that many million of the full face masks have been sold and the safety concerns about their use by those with ongoing cardiovascular and respiratory issues has not been widely publicised or brought to the attention of those who already own the masks. Those purchased before 2017 had no warning is relation to these matters and the warning included in the instructions from 2017 inwards was not prominent nor sufficient to alert prospective purchasers to the hazards of use which have now been identified.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""Following an investigation opened on the 2nd March 2020 and an inquest opened on the 5th March 2020 the inquest was concluded on the 20th December 2022.   ""},""action"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.""},""response"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9th May 2023.

Further evidence was heard that referrals for assessment and investigation of febrile seizures should be undertaken earlier to exclude a more severe underlying illness.\n \n2. Information provided to parents/guardians after their child had a Febrile Seizure \nEvidence was heard that the NHS website and pamphlet provided to parents/guardians following a child’s febrile seizure is insufficiently informative to provide parents with sufficiently detailed information to assist them in picking up potential early indicators of a more severe illness\ne.g. issues with gait, co-ordination, definition of complex seizures, developmental regression etc.\n \n3. Improvement to and highlighting of the JRCALC guidelines for paramedic management of seizures in children JRCALC guidelines indicated paramedics should have conveyed Louis to hospital or contacted the GP and/or Out of Hours GP service following Louis’s second seizure on 11th February 2020, as the close proximity of two seizures indicated it was a ‘complex febrile seizure’ rather than a febrile seizure. This led to a lost opportunity to expeditiously trigger further investigation and/or a referral to either the ‘first seizure’ service or to a specialist paediatrician for further assessment and management.

A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC’s regulation as the provision is not for “care” but support. The provision is made from an entirely un-regulated sector, resulting in some organisations offering accommodation with inadequate training, staffing or knowledge to meet the complex needs of some of our most vulnerable individuals.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –\n1.     Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;\n \n2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;\n \n3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;\n \n4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson.

(HEALTHCARE) Lack of safe system, supported by training, guidance, and compliance auditing, for the provision of physical healthcare assessment and monitoring by NEWS2 for acutely unwell patients in a secure setting.\n \nThe Jury found shortcomings in the healthcare afforded to Alex at HMP Nottingham in the form of “continuous failures to provide adequate healthcare, which probably more than minimally contributed to his death“.\n \nI heard evidence that staff were not consistently assessing acutely unwell patients using the NEWS2 system, despite the scoring system having been adopted across the NHS over the past decade and having been adopted by this Trust many years prior.\n \nIn 2017, when relaunching the NEWS system, the Royal College of Physicians noted,\n“Every so often, someone comes up with an idea that is so obvious, no one can understand why it wasn’t thought of before. I am proud that the RCP’s National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is one of those initiatives – not just a chart (or iPad) at the end of the bed to record the patient’s physical signs and symptoms, but the chart at the end of the bed – a single point of truth to unify recording of symptoms across the NHS, consolidate training for doctors and nurses in the recording of symptoms, and thereby improve patient safety. When the RCP launched the NEWS in 2012, we hoped to see the score adopted across the NHS. What has been more astonishing is the adoption of the score internationally, with requests to use NEWS coming from health services across the world from Europe to India and the USA, including the US Naval Air Forces!“\n \nI heard evidence of an inconsistent application of NEWS2 by staff, an inconsistent awareness of NEWS2 across the staff body, and an absence of clear and robust training supported by guidance, ensuring staff were aware of the expectations of their employer with regards to the use of NEWS2 in monitoring acutely unwell patients.\n \nSadly, Alex’s is not an isolated case. I have been repeatedly assured at a senior level from Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that they are seeking to embed NEWS2 across their Directorates, yet successive inquests have heard of patients failed by the lack of use of the system by the clinical staff responsible for their medical care.

Further, the ACCT is not a suitable mechanism for such monitoring. The CSRA policy is designed to protect other prisoners, but not those who suffer from medical conditions as Trevor suffered. PPG in their evidence to be considered relating to PFD matters state that a care plan dashboard is now in place at HMP Lewes but this does not appear to be individualized or tailored to the prisoner’s clinical requirements.\n \nCommunication between healthcare and prison staff especially when Trevor was returned to the wing, between the prison staff and family, briefing by prison managers to officers on the wing about Trevor’s condition were all inadequate.\n \nEvidence was heard about the lack of integration of various IT systems which contributed to poor communication. In spite of the evidence from PPG regarding the sensitivity of medical records which should not be disclosed to the prison staff, I remain concerned that there was no effective monitoring and management of Trevor on the wing once the ACCT was closed. There was no mechanism in place for prison and healthcare staff to report their concerns about Trevor’s non compliance with taking his medication to Security, thus preventing the cell from being searched for retained medication.\n \nThere was a lack of training of prison staff in dealing with long term health conditions such as epilepsy on the wings.

One of the recommendations made by the investigation panel was:\n \n“Children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should be suspected of having a pleural effusion and should get an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”\n \nThat recommendation reflected advice provided on 29th November 2022 (the day after Iona’s admission to Northampton General Hospital) by the East Midlands Paediatric Critical Care Network:\n \n“We would like to inform you of a high number of cases of highly aggressive sepsis, linked to empyema, and positive culture for Group A Streptococcus in the region. This has caused significant morbidity and mortality.\nWe advise early referral, aggressive management, high dose intravenous antibiotics, and early drainage of empyemas.\nPlease have a low threshold for investigating any child with a secondary respiratory deterioration, especially with new onset of fever. Chest X-Ray and ultrasound will be beneficial.”\n \nAt the inquest into Iona’s death, I heard evidence from the Trust’s Clinical Director of the Child Health Directorate who is also a Consultant Paediatrician.\n \nOn the basis of the evidence I heard from the Clinical Director, I am satisfied that the Trust has taken action in respect of the recommendations made and more broadly have reflected upon the circumstances of Iona’s death. However, in respect of the recommendation set out above, I am concerned that there remains a risk that future deaths could occur unless further action is taken.\n \nThe recommendation made by the investigation panel was that children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should get “an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”. However, the evidence I heard suggests this is not possible.\n \nI heard from the Clinical Director that as a district general hospital, Northampton General Hospital does not have access to a paediatric radiologist outside of 9am-5pm on Mondays and Fridays when such a specialist is either on duty or on-call. I heard evidence that in Iona’s case, a Consultant in ITU and Anaesthesia was able to perform an ultrasound scan at around 2pm on 4th December 2022 however this is not a facility that would routinely be available to the Trust and was not, in any event, part of that clinician’s core duties.\n \nI am concerned that a very unwell child who may require a chest ultrasound may not receive one ‘immediately’ and in fact may have to wait for a considerable period of time.

A member of staff was with him. On arrival he was triaged at 11:01 and assessed by a physician associate at 13:34. This was reviewed by the Emergency Medicine Consultant and a diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction was made based on the clinical assessment and x- ray of the abdomen which showed distended bowel loops. He was deemed stable and was referred to the nurse co-ordinator on the Surgical Assessment Unit (SAU) at 14:30. Evidence was provided at the inquest that the NELA (National emergency laparotomy audit) risk of death score was 2.3% at this time of referral.\n \nCrucially no CT scan was undertaken which would have provided better resolution and information on the presenting condition. Evidence was given at the inquest that this would form basic medical treatment for an acute intestinal obstruction and consideration of an abdominal emergency laparotomy. Later under examination from the trust representative, the witness recanted slightly on this stating that more junior doctors may not be minded to seek a CT scan, and commented surprisingly that requesting a scan by a consultant in the Emergency department could not be guaranteed.\n \nI received evidence in the form of the serious incident report that there were nursing shortages on that day and that the department was under considerable pressure. No surgical referral had been made. Concerns were raised that observations were not completed on time and I heard evidence from family members that their concerns about Karmchand and the pain he was suffering were not taken on board by staff. The SI report noted that there were difficulties in assessing his condition due to his mental health difficulties meaning that he could not express pain to staff as easily. His family and staff who knew him raised concerns, but adequate notice does not appear to have been taken..\n \nAt 20:30 Karmchand Deteriorated with decreasing level of consciousness and oxygen saturations and was escalated to the ED registrar and transferred to the resuscitation area where he was intubated and taken for CT scan at 22:00. The CT scan demonstrated dilated large bowel and a decision was taken for him to have urgent surgery\n \nThe delay in seeking a CT scan, which did not occur until that evening meant that surgery to treat the bowel distention only occurred much later into the evening and into the early morning of 24 September 2022. By this time, the NELA risk assessment had increased from 2.3% to 52% in other words, death was more likely to occur at that point of surgery than earlier in the day.\n \nMr Gulzar died during surgery in the early hours of 24 September 2022."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nKarmchand was referred to the surgical nursing team instead of the surgical registrar or surgical on-call team, as required by the Emergency Department to surgical registrar referral pathway from a previous SI where it had been identified as an issue. This was not followed in this case, leading to a delay in surgery and increased risk of death. I am concerned that the surgical registrar referral pathway is not being utilised despite previous incidents in which its use was highlighted as necessary.\n \nNo CT scan was undertaken as required by the acute abdominal pathway and guidance as part of the initial assessment. I was concerned by evidence that a CT scan would not be undertaken urgently as part of an acute abdominal presentation and that the necessity for a scan may not be known by junior (or some consultant) doctors.\n \nThe deterioration in Karmchand’s condition was not recognised due to difficulties in communication of pain due to his mental health condition. Concerns raised by his carers and family who knew him best and his presentation were not given adequate weight. A previous SI was reported to have raised this issue, but no action point or plan was provided in the current report to set out how staff could improve the assessment of patients with communication difficulties, by using observations and relying on people\nwho better knew their demeanour and presentation."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 26 September 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death\nof Karmchand GULZAR.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nA thematic review completed in November 2021 had identified a number of significant issues in the functioning of mental health services, and many of the same issues were also identified in the serious incident review into Linda’s care and treatment, from February 2022 until her death. It is apparent that any actions taken as a result of the thematic review were not effective in implementing change and that the action plan was still a “work in progress” at the Pre Hearing Review Hearings which took place in this case in 2023.\nThe Serious Incident Investigation into the care received by Linda was not completed until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after the death. This is neither timely nor responsive. Despite reassurances given that the Trust are working to eradicate such delays, in response to a series of previous PFD reports issued by the Coroners of Durham and Darlington, there are still cases coming to the attention of the Coronial service where Serious Incident Investigations are significantly delayed in excess of the 60 day NHS framework.\nAs previously reported the concern in relation to the delays in such investigations and any subsequent necessary action required, is twofold. Firstly, the quality of the investigation is severely compromised as the evidence is not captured when memories are fresh. Secondly, because any lessons to be learnt and improvements to be made to improve patient safety cannot be implemented promptly."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 19th of April 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Linda Louise Banks, aged 48 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18th of December 2023. The medical cause of death was 1a) Paracetamol overdose with alcohol misuse. I gave a narrative conclusion as follows:-\n \nLinda Louise Banks died on the 10th of April 2022 at the University Hospital of North Durham. Linda had a history of alcohol misuse and mental health difficulties, including self harm and suicidal ideation. Linda also had learning difficulties which may have increased her vulnerability, which were not identified by vast majority of the mental health professionals, and there is no evidence that consideration was given to any reasonable adjustments that might be necessary, or as to any impact such may have had on her presentation, communication and understanding.\n \nLinda herself, her family and her friends, made multiple contacts with mental health services between February 2022 and her death, as her mental health deteriorated and concerns were expressed as to her safety. Referrals were also made by two external agencies, namely her GP and a home support agency, both expressing concerns about Linda’s presentation. On each occasion risks were considered to be minimal and no further treatment or care was provided by mental health services.\n \nThere were a multiplicity of difficulties revealed by a serious incident review which was extensively delayed and not received until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after Linda’s death. It concludes that Linda did not receive the right care at the right time and her needs were not fully met, and included concerns, in summary, in relation to the quality of assessments and triage, quality of safety planning, poor record keeping, and further considers that there was an underestimation of risk and a lack of a trauma informed approach. I also find that these difficulties culminated in advice being given to a friend attempting to support Linda and communicated to her family, from an unknown mental health worker, that they should consider “tough love” and to effectively step back from their intensive support of Linda, thus removing an essential safety net in the absence of any ongoing mental health treatment or support. The identified failings cumulatively contributed to the death more than minimally.\n \nAn earlier thematic review which had been completed in November 2021 identified many similar serious issues in the provision of mental health services, to those identified in this case, and it is clear that many of these issues were continuing at the time of Linda’s death in April of 2022 and had not been addressed effectively by the Trust.\n \nOn the 9th April 2022 Police forced entry to Linda’s home, as a result of concerns raised by her family and friends and was taken to hospital by ambulance. She was hyperthermic and had low blood sugar and had taken an overdose of medication. Despite attempts to treat her she died in hospital on the 10th April 2022 as a result of the acute complications of paracetamol overdose on a background of alcohol related liver disease"",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23.2.24 .

On 30 June 2021 Katherine was referred to the syringomyelia clinic (specialist clinic for patients with a syrinx). Although Katherine had back pain there was not felt to be a spinal surgical cause for this, and she was discharged from the complex spine clinic but was then referred to the pain team. Katherine had a history of progressive sensory and motor symptoms on the right side and because this could not be explained by her syrinx, an urgent MRI brain scan was requested. This scan was performed on 31 August 2021 and reported as normal. On 13 December 2021 Katherine was seen by a Consultant in Pain Medicine who noted the brain MRI of August looked abnormal and requested a review of the scan. On review there was a mass lesion that had been missed. Katherine underwent a further MRI of the brain where she was found to have tumour (left superior cerebellar / left quadrigeminal cistern region) which had increased in size by approximately 10mm since 31 August 2021. On 18 January 2022 a biopsy was undertaken to establish the type of tumour and a further scan took place on 2 February 2022 when the tumour was felt to have increased in size further. The tumour was found to be an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT). This being a highly malignant central nervous system neoplasm which generally affects infants and is reported to rarely occur in adults. The prognosis of this type of tumour was poor. The management plan was to remove as much of the tumour as possible and then treat it with chemotherapy and radiation. Katherine was consented for the procedure where the risk to life was deemed low. Katherine was admitted to the Walton Centre on 21 February 2022 and underwent the surgery on 22 February 2022. The surgery was uneventful, and a large portion of the tumour was removed but there was still part of the tumour that remained as it could not be removed. Post -operatively, Katherine was slow to wake, and a CT brain scan showed there was some blood at the site of surgery, and it was reviewed by the operating surgeons and no further surgery was felt to be necessary. The plan was to leave the external ventricular drain (EVD) in and continue high dose steroids to help reduce post operative swelling. Katherine was transferred to the intensive care unit to be kept sedated and ventilated overnight. As the sedation was reduced, Katherine became aware of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and bit down on it causing significant trauma to her tongue at the same time. The sedation was increased to enable Katherine to tolerate the tube again. Later that day the tongue was noted to be very swollen and was assessed as being a risk to the airway which prevented the removal of the ETT. The sedation was reduced over the ensuing 48 hours and neurological assessment showed improvement, eye opening to stimuli, obeying commands on the left side however there was still a severe weakness on the right side."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

On 31 August 2018 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool Hospital presenting with vomiting and right upper quadrant pain, a known complication after a TACE procedure. Various medications were prescribed but the pain was ongoing. On 11 September 2018, whilst still in hospital, Amirah was prescribed dexamethasone (a steroid), initially [REDACTED] twice daily and  then [REDACTED] once a day. She was then discharged from hospital. A discharge summary was sent to her General Practice (GP) requesting the steroid medication to be reviewed. When the steroids were prescribed there was no indication noted as to the length of the intended treatment course in the clinical notes or in the discharge letter issued by the hospital team. In April 2019 the steroids were noted as a repeat prescription in the GP records rather than an acute prescription. It is unclear upon what basis this was done. On 12 June 2019 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital with dizzy spells. It was noted that her high blood pressure was poorly controlled. Her dexamethasone was continued in hospital and on discharge. A discharge summary was sent to her GP practice with the steroids to be continued. On 12 September 2019 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool hospital with similar symptoms. Her dexamethasone was continued again in hospital and on discharge. Throughout 2019-2022 Amirah had numerous consultations with various specialists in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. On 29 December 2022 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital feeling generally unwell and with leg pain. Treating medical professionals deemed that Amirah’s case was complex and multiple organ systems were investigated and treated. Despite active treatment Amirah deteriorated and died on 31 January 2023. The post mortem examination found it was more likely than not Amirah died as a result of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis and intestinal haemorrhage as a result of long term steroid therapy. Throughout, on each discharge from hospital, a discharge letter was sent to Amirah’s GP and was generally to continue the dexamethasone. There were a number of failures relating to the care and treatment afforded to Amirah; through numerous appointments an incomplete medication history was taken and documented which did not include dexamethasone. Amirah had multiple complex conditions and was under the care of numerous specialists, many of whom clearly did not appreciate she was on steroids, and had been, for a lengthy period of time. Amirah was seen by numerous clinicians both in the hospital and in the community and at no stage was it questioned as to why she was still on the steroids, and why at the high dose she was on. Evidence has been heard that it was rare for a patient to be on these steroids at this dose for a lengthy period of time. Amirah presented with symptoms clearly suggestive of the possibility of complications of steroid use, namely uncontrollable blood pressure, diabetes, swelling and cognitive impairment. There was a failure to recognise these obvious presentations and the link between them and the long term steroid use. There was a failure to document in the clinical notes and / or in the discharge letter, the indication or length of the dexamethasone tablets. This failure prevented adequate instructions being provided to Amirah’s GP as to the intended length of the dexamethasone treatment and monitoring of the same. There was a failure for the GP to clarify the discharge with the hospital and to review the medication, this failure was exacerbated by the fact the prescription was changed to repeat from acute with no apparent reason. Overall, there was a catalogue of missed opportunities both in hospital as well as in the community to identify that Amirah remained unnecessarily on dexamethasone tablets despite multiple reviews as an inpatient and outpatient. Even when the ongoing prescription was identified, and Amirah was symptomatic of Cushing’s disease and steroid induced diabetes the correct action to wean treatment completely was not undertaken. It is a basic and fundamental expectation for a clinician in charge of a patient’s care to monitor and review prescribed medication, particularly acute medication such as steroids. There was a failure to do this for Amirah despite the fact that there were numerous opportunities to do so over a lengthy period of time. The accumulation of failures through the primary and secondary care services has led to a gross failure to provide basic medical attention to Amirah who was in a dependent position and had every reason to rely upon those who had management of her care and treatment to prescribe, monitor and review her medication. It is more likely than not the inappropriate and prolonged administration of steroids caused Amirah’s death."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In 2020 Gracie started working for a company in Chesterfield called Xbite. Whilst working at Xbite, Gracie met up on a number of occasions outside of work with a male colleague who was employed as a supervisor at Xbite. Gracie decided that she did not want to have any sort of relationship with the supervisor and made this clear to him in December 2020. The supervisor failed to accept Gracie’s decision and became obsessed and fixated with her. Gracie reported the supervisor’s behaviour to Xbite in January 2021 and he was subsequently dismissed from Xbite in February 2021.   "",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nDerbyshire Constabulary:\n \nStalking – during the inquest I heard evidence from the police officers who were involved in investigating Gracie’s stalking complaint in February 2021. Derbyshire Constabulary accepted that there were serious failings in how Gracie’s complaint was investigated by these officers. I do recognise that Derbyshire Constabulary has taken some steps following Gracie’s death to improve knowledge around stalking. However, as the Detective Chief Superintendent who gave evidence for the Constabulary accepted, more needs to be done to improve knowledge and understanding around how officers should investigate complaints of stalking. Consideration may be given to:\n \nReviewing the current force guidance/training on stalking and considering whether further guidance/training is required in light of the issues identified during the inquest (including consideration of whether there ought to be a force policy on stalking);\n \nRe-enforcing understanding of the existing training/guidance on stalking including consideration of further training sessions/briefings to emphasise the key issues around investigating complaints of stalking, particularly in relation to the need to investigate the stalking complaint fully in order to identify potential patterns in the suspect’s alleged behaviour;\n \nEnsuring officers are aware of the available resources on stalking and, crucially, the importance of actually consulting the available resources on stalking when police officers are investigating stalking cases to ensure that investigations are conducted in line with expected standards.\n \nRisk assessments – during the inquest I saw a number of good quality risk assessments completed by police call handlers/officers who were involved in the very early stages of Gracie’s stalking complaint in February 2021 and also the rucksack incident in May 2021. However, it became apparent during the inquest that the police officers who were subsequently allocated to deal with the stalking complaint and the rucksack incident failed to record any form of risk assessment or fully assess the potential risks. As was recognised by the Detective Chief Superintendent who gave evidence for the Constabulary at the inquest, the crime report for the stalking investigation in February 2021 lacked any sort of risk assessment or even a recognition of potential risks. I heard evidence from the police officers involved in the stalking investigation and the rucksack incident and I am concerned that there may be an ongoing lack of understanding about the importance of completing comprehensive risk assessments which include the initial identification of risk and also, importantly, a regular re-assessment of risk as the investigation progresses. I consider that further steps should be considered in order to improve understanding and appreciation of the importance of completing comprehensive risk assessments.\n \nIndependent Office for Police Conduct (“IOPC”) – the IOPC carried out an investigation into the conduct of the five officers involved in the stalking investigation and the rucksack incident. The IOPC made a number of recommendations to Derbyshire Constabulary which included:\n \n‘2. To consider how stalking offence locations are recorded on Niche. There does not appear to be any guidance to suggest that all of the locations of the stalking offending are tagged to the incident individually. In this instance it may not have made any difference as the officers who received the bag did not do a search of police systems for the area. However, in future that may well be done, and it could make the difference between linking risk and suspects.’\n \nI heard evidence about this issue from the Detective Chief Superintendent on behalf of the Constabulary and I am concerned that more needs to be done to engage with this specific recommendation from the IOPC. The inquest heard that specific geographical locations can be particularly important in stalking investigations (i.e the horse field in Gracie’s case). As such, it seems to me that the IOPC recommendation is an important one which could assist in future cases with linking suspects and particular locations relevant to the stalking investigation.\n \nContemporaneous note taking/record keeping – during the inquest I heard that police officers failed to make any contemporaneous notes of important steps in the police investigation including, for example, conversations with an informant/member of the public, words of advice given to a suspect, a telephone call to a potential witness and also an internal police discussion between a police constable and police sergeant discussing the closure of an investigation. The written crime reports reviewed during the inquest also lacked sufficient detail around these important conversations/investigative steps – in other words, the crime reports did not compensate for the lack of contemporaneous notes.\n \nI am concerned that a lack of contemporaneous notes/insufficient detail within a crime report may impact on the ability to make properly informed risk assessments which rely on the existence of a good written record of important conversations/steps taken during an investigation. This may become an issue where, for example, an investigation is re-allocated to another police officer who has had no prior involvement in the investigation such that the newly allocated police officer will be reliant upon the quality of the original police officer’s records/notes."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 21 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gracie Elizabeth Spinks (“Gracie”) who was 23 years old when she died on 18 June 2021.

His mother had risk factors – gestational diabetes, a congenital heart condition and heightened blood pressure. At 4 minutes of age Alfie was noted as “grunting”. At 03.55 observations were documented on the NEWTT chart. Two were in the amber category – respiratory rate of 72 rpm and Oxygen saturation of 88%. The Mother was concerned and there was cyanosis around the mouth and nose. Intermittent grunting was noticed. At a review noted up at 5am, having probably occurred at around 04.30, saturation was 89.93%. On re-testing with a monitor from the resuscitate it was found to be 97%. The assessment found that there were no other signs of respiratory distress. The evidence from the Trust has included that given the maternal risk factors, once the two amber category observation at 03.55 had been documented, antibiotics should immediately have been administered to Alfie on a pre-emptive basis. In the event antibiotics were not applied, nor was close monitoring implemented. Alfie’s temperature fluctuated. At 05.15 he was 37.5 degrees. By 14.00 he was 37 degrees. The fluctuation was to some extent influenced by environmental factors. He was noted as intermittently groaning at 06.30. There were complications with feeding. He underwent a tongue-tie procedure at 10.20. At 11.30 the complications were persisting. At around 16.45 Alfie was discharged home. He became increasingly unsettled, crying consistently. This worsened such that the parents called 999. Pre-alert to the Emergency Department of University Hospital of North Durham at 00.02 on 14 June 2022 stated that Alfie was in cardiac arrest. Despite intensive treatment, and a brief return of cardiac output at 00.40, Alfie declined and died at 01.50. The medical cause of death provided following postmortem was 1)a) severe congenital pneumonia and meningitis, b) suspected acute chorioamnionitis. Reflecting the concession in the evidence of the Trust witnesses, the omission of antibiotics from 03.55 on 13 June 2022 is more likely than not to have contributed directly to Alfie’s death and, but for this omission, he would not have died."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

He had a history of 3 falls in the previous few days which following an examination was considered to be attributable to a condition called postural hypotension. This condition results in a sudden drop of blood pressure when somebody stands up and can cause dizziness even temporary unconsciousness. The treating clinicians view, in respect of which I agreed, was that the postural hypotension and general frailty likely caused Ray’s falls noted over the previous few days.\n \nRay was admitted the following day onto the Linnett Acute Medical Unit (LAMU) and a CT scan undertaken revealed evidence of chronic subdural haematomas, indicative of previous head trauma more likely than not attributable to earlier falls, not necessarily those falls in the last few days. In keeping with the hospital’s falls policy, following his arrival on LAMU, Charge Nurse [REDACTED] who was starting the night shift, carried out a falls risk assessment amongst other assessments. Relying on information that was passed to him verbally at the  shift handover before 8 o’clock that evening, he was however only told and therefore recorded as part of that falls risk assessment that Ray had had 1 fall in the last 12 months. Whilst recognising that there was a risk of a fall the assessment did not trigger any of the higher levels of monitoring over and above 1 hourly care rounding such as ensuring that Ray was within line of sight or more importantly was within arm’s reach of a care worker.\n \nWhilst the plan was for hourly care rounding I noted that no such checks were made on Ray from 20:50 on 17th January 2023 until just after midnight on 18th January 2023, although it was not material in my view to the events that followed but was indicative as regards the working pressures faced by nursing staff on that shift.\n \nAt 00:45 on 18th  January  2023, Nurse [REDACTED] was called by another patient in the same bay as Ray and saw him stood next to his bed passing urine into a bottle. She recalls the night light was on and she could see him clearly. She observed him suddenly falling to the right not putting his hands out to break his fall and he fell hitting his head on the chair leg as he collapsed to the floor. Due to the postural hypotension Ray was being given IV fluids and this equipment was connected to his arm. I was not of the view that the equipment contributed to the fall and found as a fact that the fall more likely than not was attributable to Ray’s postural hypotension.\n \nAs a consequence of the fall, Ray was found to have suffered head trauma and in addition had fractured his right neck of femur in respect of which it was noted more likely than not it was an osteoporotic fracture. The fracture was repaired the following day on the 19th January 2023, however, Ray as a result of immobility and trauma sustained deteriorated and he began to develop swallowing issues. He also became generally more confused and ultimately, he developed an aspiration pneumonia from which sadly he died in The Great Western Hospital on the 25th January 2023.\n \nDuring  the Inquest  hearing I heard live  evidence  from  Charge  Nurse [REDACTED] who came across as a conscientious and caring Nurse. That having been said I did ask probing questions\nof Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  as regards the discrepancy between Ray’s pre-admission history and\nwhat was actually  recorded  as part of the falls risk assessment.   By way of background,  I  was\ntold that  LAMU  consisted  of a ward  with  36 beds.   Back  in January  2023  those  beds  were\noccupied by elderly patients. I was told following the arrival of a new Chief Nurse there had been improvements in relation to staffing levels and at the time of Ray’s fall Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  told\nme that there was  1 Senior Nursing Sister in charge, 5 Registered Nurses of which he was one,\n4 Health Care Assistants  and 2 enhanced Care Workers.    "",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""Falls in the hospital environment do happen and I am not saying that all can be avoided. That having been said what I have noted of late when dealing with these cases is an increase in the instances where as a result of my investigation, in relation to cases that I have been directly involved in, that I am making findings that more likely than not the falls could have been prevented and the injuries that were causative in relation to that individuals death, avoided.\n \nRay was a 96 year old gentleman who would have died had it not been for the fall at some point in the future. That may have been in a matter of weeks, months or even a few years but had it not been for the fall on the night of the 17th 18th January 2023 he would not have died as he did, in the circumstances that he did, on the 25th January 2023.\n \nDuring the course of the Inquest, I also heard evidence from Sister Jones and in addition to the challenge of getting the staffing levels commensurate to the patients needs and safeguarding patients there does appear to be an issue that causes me a concern as regards the ability to dynamically respond to a need for enhanced supervision especially entering into night shifts. Sister Jones when questioned was open and extremely candid in her answer that at those times nursing staff could not always support those additional needs in the short term because of the challenge to get additional personnel at short notice in circumstances where the nursing team were under pressure due to the complexities and demands of patient’s needs. There is in my view no flexibility and resilience within the system to dynamically adapt and respond to changing patients enhanced needs exacerbated by the fact that especially during the winter months these beds are mainly occupied by the elderly. It is easier during day shifts to respond but  there clearly appears to be an issue especially going into night shifts.\n \nThere were 2 issues here, firstly the initial falls risk assessment on LAMU which was not undertaken  taking advantage  of all available  information  which in  my  view led to an  incorrect\nassessment  of  Ray’s  supervision  needs.    His fall  was  observed  by  another  member  of the nursing staff and therefore my view was that only arm’s length supervision would have avoided the fall and that there were sufficient indicators to warrant this prior to the event occurring. The failure here in relation to the initial assessment was down to the volume of work and not in my view laziness or anything of that nature on the part of nursing staff.\n \nFlowing from the first issue a further issue relates to the resilience and the ability to respond dynamically with changing patients on the ward so as to ensure that vulnerable patients with a high degree of risk of falling, like Ray, are properly safeguarded.\n \n[REDACTED] in her evidence talked about an ongoing programme, the Enhanced Care Toolkit Framework, which I acknowledge is work in progress, in respect of which not only the family but also I am interested in hearing what steps the Trust intends to take to mitigate against a risk of further incidents occurring such as the fall that Ray had on the night of 17th/18th of January.\n \nThis report is also being sent to The Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care and the reason I have sent this to The Secretary of State is to highlight the issue and my concerns. Often when Regulation 28 Reports are submitted responses often come back from Government Departments as regards the increase in the amount of money that they are injecting into that particular public service. Coroners cannot  make recommendations but as we advance in time into yet another winter period, which will undoubtedly be challenging for frontline NHS personnel, combined with an ever-increasing elderly population whose care needs both physical and mental are more complicated and demanding, it is essential that when these vulnerable people come into the care of the state, that they are effectively safeguarded. I cannot see this winter being much different from last winter and at the moment and my concern is that potentially it could be worse. Whilst the focus of this report relates to a hospital environment, the challenges created by an increasing elderly population in terms of NHS and social care response affects those in the community as well. I do not believe that there is an easy fix for these issues when resources and budgets are stretched. The problem here undoubtedly is multi factorial but any solution here is one in respect of which the Government undoubtedly has a crucial role to play,\nand I hope The Secretary of State understands why she is a recipient to this Regulation 28 Report."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 13th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raymond Lionel Eggleton and I opened an Inquest into his death on the same date.  On the 14th November 2023 I concluded Ray’s Inquest.

It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual’s notes is not provided as standard.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \nThe focus of my concerns relates to the approach of your Trust to learning from deaths. Although Mr Barnes was not treated at the John Radcliffe Hospital, I concluded that he should have been transferred there, and that the delay in carrying out vascular surgery there contributed to his death. The Oxford Trust has been involved in this investigation almost from the start, and other Interested Persons involved in the investigation have attempted to work with your Trust to investigate the circumstances of Mr Barnes’ death.\n \nI have been assisted by investigation reports and statements from the Spire Dunedin Hospital, and Royal Berkshire Hospital. This, I am afraid, sits in stark contrast to the response and approach by the Oxford Trust.\n \nThe Oxford Trust has carried out no investigation. They did not co-operate with the offer to conduct a joint investigation with Royal Berkshire Hospital.\n \nThere is no recorded morbidity and mortality meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.\n \nThere is no recorded MDT meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.\n \nThere is no evidence of proposed changes beyond evidence in court during the inquest that “we are looking into this”. Whilst I accept entirely that a knee-jerk response, even following a tragic death, is not appropriate, it is now some 18 months since Mr Barnes’ death.\n \nEvidence from RBH and Spire Dunedin was consistent, namely that attempts to liaise with your trust and learn from this event jointly have been universally ignored.\n \nIt was also difficult for my office to obtain evidence for the inquest. We were provided with a joint statement, from three consultant vascular surgeons (only two of whom were clinically involved). It transpired that this statement was written by a clinical governance manager, and each of the witnesses who gave evidence was careful to tell the court that they did not agree with the wording of that statement. We subsequently received a statement from the consultant vascular surgeon in this case on the 29th of September, and from the clinical lead of vascular surgery some 5 days before the inquest started. We were also informed 11 days before the inquest started that the key vascular surgery witness would be on holiday abroad. This witness was summonsed in May 2023. He ultimately gave evidence by video link, but this was difficult technically, and arrangements would have been made for him to attend in person, had we been made aware of this holiday arrangement, even aside from the fact that he had been formally summonsed."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""I have on occasion referred to the deceased as Barney.

It was heard in evidence a radiologist would need to telephone the department in question or go there to inspect the notes. Their awareness of a patient’s condition is based on a telephone call referral followed by a summary document which can be at odds with each.\n–  It is of concern that the use of telephone referral system and summary could contain errors and the radiologist must rely on this information, with no quick way to inspect a patient’s notes.\n–   The evidence also dealt with radiologists working in 2 hour triage shifts in a hectic environment where those clinicians receiving the referral seldom were the clinicians who carried out the imaging. The inference was the arrangement was susceptible to error.\n–  Over the course of the inquest evidence was heard on a number of issues where information passed to and from clinicians involved in Mr MORETON’s care was inaccurate and misleading.\n–  Assumptions were made that, Mr MORETON was improving clinically when a surgical opinion was sought, this was incorrect.\n–   It was assumed Mr MORETON would be referred for a surgical opinion by ED department clinicians, when in fact none took place.\n–  Clinicians in Newcastle Upon Tyne when asked for advice were under the impression treatment was working as it was mentioned his discharge from hospital was comptemplated\n– this was not the case.\n–   Overall I am concerned by the poor and misleading communications between clinicians, departments and Hospital Trusts on matters of vital importance to patient care."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 5th April 2023 an inquest was opened into the death of Brian David MORETON.

The evidence that was heard from a Consultant Intensivist was that the sooner that CPR can be commenced the greater chance that a person is able to survive a cardiac arrest, with minimal if no long lasting disabilities. The inquest concluded that the EMD should have directed staff at the Lord Cradoc to commence CPR and it is understood that compulsory training has been given to all Wetherspoons staff to enable them to comply with EMD instructions. This compulsory training dod not extend to CPR training.\n \nIt is not the purpose of this report to compel your organisation to provide CPR training to its staff but to make such training available to staff who express an interest. It is recognised that such situations are stressful situations and that it would be unfair to impose compulsory CPR training to staff, however as with all organisations some individuals would welcome the opportunity to benefit from such training. No failings were found against the staff who attended to Christopher that evening and they ought to be commended for their actions.\n \nI am concerned that in such cases bar staff at pubs will invariably find themselves in situations where the administering of emergency CPR treatment ought to be administered. The time taken between the beginning of an emergency call and an instruction to commence CPR may deprive a patient of a favourable outcome. Whilst Wetherspoons staff have been trained to comply with EMD instructions there are occasions such as this case where staff could implement CPR of their own accord before being instructed to do so by EMD’s. The training would not only teach staff the correct techniques but educate them of the situations in which CPR should be used.\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –\n \n1.       In a pub environment there is a greater chance for the public to sustain injuries that requires emergency treatment\n2.       Ordinary bystanders’ ability to administer emergency treatment may be hindered by their own consumption of alcohol\n3.       Whilst the primary responsibility of staff is to comply with EMD directions they are deprived of the opportunity to provide lifesaving treatment in circumstances that warrant it if that training is not offered\n4.       Staff would not know the circumstances that warrant it without the benefit of CPR training."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 11th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher James Locke.

Detailed factual findings in Security Sensitive form are held by MOD and I request that you should have regard to the full Security Sensitive factual findings."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""I have been greatly assisted by detailed evidence from MOD on the changes made to the relevant aspects of military diving training since Ben’s death. From that evidence it is very clear that there has been a comprehensive and far-reaching review of policies, practices and organisational structures which will have very significantly reduced the risk of future fatalities. In several areas, the changes made go beyond those recommended by the Defence Safety Authority, and in nearly all other cases the recommendations have been adequately addressed. There are a few areas where there remains technological limitations to the response to the earlier DSA recommendations , but I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard that appropriate technological advances are being rapidly sought, with the risks in the meantime being mitigated by other means. Among over thirty recommendations arising from earlier investigations where extensive action has already been taken, there are four discrete areas in relation to which I assess that the Statutory threshold for me to make a Report to Prevent Future Deaths is met. Accordingly, it is still the case that during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to conce rn. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you .\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(1)  A stand-by diver was present at the dive exercise and he was deployed to try to find and rescue Ben. However, the stand-by diver had to surface having run out of breathable gas before Ben was found. A spare breathing apparatus cylinder was not carried in the safety boat for the stand-by diver (or other divers) to use in the event that the stand-by diver’s main cylinder ran out.\n \n(2)  The progression of the dive training in which Ben was engaged was safety-critical. The progression of training was accelerated for several reasons, one of which was a visit by a high-ranking naval officer. The concern of the instructing staff was to polish the drills ahead of that visit and to take the pressure off the dive students by allowing them to practise\nthe dive with relevant equipment ahead of the visit. This acceleration of safety-critical training in part because of such a visit was not appropriate.\n \n(3)  Ben was lifted unconscious from the sea bed and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation was immediately started. A defibrillator was also applied, but this was only available because it was carried by a Harbour Patrol vessel which came to assist. I am concerned that in such safety-critical military diving training, the dive support staff did not have available to them a defibrillator of their own either on the supporting safety boats or on land. This did not cause or contribute to Ben’s death but could lead to future fatalities.\n \n(4) There is an inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus as between the maintenance manual for which DE&S is responsible and all other policy and safety guidance."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 26 November 2018 the Senior Coroner for Dorset commenced an investigation into the death of BENJAMIN DAVID MCQUEEN, aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held by me as nominated Judge Coroner from 10 to 28 July 2023. "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""(1)   As to carrying a spare breathing apparatus cylinder in safety boats in addition to that carried by the stand-by diver where this is practicable, I am reassured that this appears to be happening in practice in Ben’s former unit. But I have a concern that this does not yet appear in policy guidance and it is a safety concern that may need to be more widely shared in defence.\n \n(2)   As to avoiding visits by senior ranking Officers or VIP visitors to training courses leading to an acceleration of safety-critical training, I am reassured that action has been taken in Ben’s former unit such that this should not recur in relation to the relevant diving training. But I have a concern as to whether this has been shared more widely amongst other military units.\n \n(3)   As to the availability of defibrillators, I was informed that they are present at some, but not all, dive sites used by Ben’s former Unit. The risk assessment suggesting that defibrillators are not required because of the age/health profile of those attending the diving training appears to focus upon the risk of myocardial infarction (or similar) from a natural cause or routine exercise, rather than the risk of cardiac arrest / heart arrythmias caused by traumatic injury when carrying out arduous military diving.\n \n(4)   As to the inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus, I was informed that the relevant operators would not need to consult the detailed maintenance manual such that confusion should not occur. Nevertheless, I consider that in the sphere of safety-critical dive training, there is an unnecessary residual risk in different figures being given for the minimum safety pressure level for a type of diver’s breathing apparatus.\n \nIn relation to each of these areas, in my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you as the responsible Minister for the Ministry of Defence have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Friday 22 September 2023.

The patient was diagnosed as not suffering from any form of cancer and was therefore referred on to the “benign” gynaecology team.\n \nMs Nakafeero was advised that it was likely that the most effective treatment for her condition was a hysterectomy. It was expected that the likely wait for this treatment would be 6 months.\n \nMs Nakafeero was not allocated an appointment and therefore had not received the necessary surgery by the time of her death in June 2022. Had the surgery been undertaken it is probable that she would not have developed a pulmonary embolism.\n \nAlthough the trust has investigated these circumstances and implemented change, no clear explanation could be offered for why the deceased slipped out of this care pathway. I am not satisfied that the risk of re-occurrence has been properly addressed.\n \n2.       The clinicians treating Ms Nakafeero assessed her VTE risk utilising an established algorithm based on national guidance. The assessment was undertaken appropriately but it failed to identify two risk factors which made the formation of a DVT more likely, namely, large uterine fibroids and the use of tranexamic acid.

He spoke to his GP on 19 October who advised rest and fluids and went with [REDACTED] to a walk in centre on 21 October who advised him to attend hospital. He was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn and admitted. He was unwell with acute kidney injury and febrile. He was given IV fluids and antibiotics and urine and stool samples sent. The junior doctor clerking him did not use the clerking booklet when performing a VTE assessment which would have guided [REDACTED] to prescribe 40mg of enoxaparin an anti- coagulant, instead [REDACTED ]used the VTE assessment on the electronic prescribing system which is not as detailed as the paper clerking booklet. To prescribe anticoagulants the electronic VTE assessment has to be filled in. Despite Mr Greenway’s known risk factors of age, obesity, recent infection and loss of mobility she prescribed a “renal dose” of 20mg of enoxaparin, half the usual dose. Mr Greenway’s eGFR (measurement of renal function) was 58 and the dose of anticoagulant is only supposed to be reduced if this measurement is below 30. When spoken to after Mr Greenway’s death [REDACTED] explanation was that [REDACTED] did this in a excess of caution despite clear guidelines. Mr Greenway remained on this dose for his entire hospital stay. No senior clinician checked this prescription, the consultant who gave evidence assumed the pharmacists would have done a reconciliation. Mr Greenway was discharged and died several days later from a pulmonary embolism.\nThe pharmacy service at weekends at this hospital had been suspended for some time, this consultant was even aware of this.  [REDACTED] said   [REDACTED]was too busy to check individual patients’ new prescriptions on  [REDACTED] ward rounds. The pharmacy reconciliation is meant to operate as a fail safe or safety net, it is the Consultant Doctor’s responsibility to check what their junior unsupervised doctors do at the weekend when a patient is admitted. This consultant didn’t ever speak to this junior doctor about this mis-prescribing or know what action if any had been taken about it.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  \n1.  Upon RA’s arrival back at the Nursing Home on 2nd August, staff immediately raised a Safeguarding concern in respect of, inter alia, his genitals being covered in a white “cheese” like substance with, additionally, faecal matter in his pubic hair; extensive areas of flaking skin including behind his ears was also identified. Colour photographs were taken and provided to the Trust along with the Safeguarding documentation. Objectively, the photographs clearly documented the flaking skin and white “cheese” like material covering RA’s penis.\n \n2.  Evidence confirmed that the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, responsible for Basildon Hospital, carried out a significantly flawed RCA investigation which effectively rejected any suggestions of shortcoming in care, management and treatment. The Ward Matron (responsible for the ward concerned) was the co-author responsible for the RCA Report. [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest that she had not been provided with the photographs provided by the Nursing Home and RA’s daughter until just two weeks prior to the inquest hearing.  (It was noted and accepted that even when [REDACTED] had seen the photographs neither nor the Trust had seen fit to draw this to HMC’s attention or to provide either an addendum statement or a revised RCA).\n \n3. The Trust’s responsible Adult Safeguarding Lead provided a statement in which [REDACTED] confirmed that, notwithstanding the photos having been expressly noted in the original Safeguarding referral and raised in subsequent correspondence and meetings with the Thurrock Local Authority Safeguarding Team, [REDACTED] had not made the photos available for the purposes of the RCA. [REDACTED] was unable to provide any explanation at all for this failure. This lack of professionalism was and remains a grave cause for concern resulting as it did in a seriously flawed Trust investigation, which itself fed into the Thurrock Adult Safeguarding investigation and, further still, a wider section 42 systemic investigation involving RA’s case and two others to which a range of stakeholders contributed. It was accepted by the Trust witnesses that but for the coronial investigation, the denials of any Trust failings would have remained unchallenged perpetuating a false record of the basic nursing care provided (or not provided) to the highly vulnerable and dependent RA.\n \n4. The evidence heard at the inquest undermined the following erroneous findings of the RCA:\n·  In response to the concern that RA had extensive flakes of fungal growth behind his ears the RCA concluded that “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation supports regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”\n \n·  In respect to the concern that RA’s foreskin/genitals were covered in flakes and what appeared to be “cheese / paste” the RCA asserted that there were “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation support regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”"",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 3rd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ronald Scott Ashdown, aged 55 years.

In addition the inquest heard how there was no safe system to communicate high levels of clozapine.\n \n2.       Medication changes: After a review on 14/10/22, when a high level of clozapine was noted from a blood test on 03/05/22, the consultant indicated that medication should reduce on the next prescription. This was communicated by email to the care coordinator however this was not read or acted upon. The inquest heard how there was no safe system to effect medication changes.\n \n3.       How to record high clozapine levels: The clozapine and nor clozapine levels are recorded in the pharmacy section of the records. There was no system for highlighting high clozapine results in the rio notes which are routinely used by all clinicians.\n \n4.       Understanding of clozapine: I heard evidence that there was a lack of understanding of when to measure clozapine levels, how to interpret high clozapine levels and then how to respond to a high level.\n \n5.       August 2020 Regulation 28 report: I sent a Regulation 28 report in August 2020 (case of Ian Allen) which identified that there was no system in place to ensure abnormal clozapine levels were escalated and acted upon and that there was a lack of understanding of the importance of clozapine monitoring and how frequently levels should be monitored. Given this report there is a concern that the Trust has not learnt from the previous Regulation 28 report.\n \n6.       Quality of the internal investigation process: The initial investigation report did not raise significant issues regarding the monitoring of clozapine and importantly whether Mr Hussain did in fact have toxicity. It was only when [REDACTED] wrote a report on 26/03/23 (7months after the death) that this issue was highlighted and addressed.

In the circumstances it is  my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \nPreamble \nDuring the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashton’s gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time.\n \nDuring the ‘relevant period’ examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton’s death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as ‘player protection tools’, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him.\n \nConcerns\n1)    I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler.\n \n2)     I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally.\n \n3)     I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 06 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Luke Anthony Ashton aged 40.

For a variety of reasons, a home birth was against medical advice, this had been explained on a number of occasions throughout the pregnancy. On the 17th December 2021 advice to transfer to hospital had been given by midwives during early labour due to concerns that Sinon’s mother was showing signs of pre-eclampsia and due to findings of light meconium staining on rupture of membranes which could indicate fetal distress. This advice was not accepted. At 12:47 it was identified that Sinon maybe an undiagnosed breech presentation, transfer to hospital was recommended and declined. Up to that time presentation based on abdominal palpitation and vaginal examinations had been assessed as cephalic. A frank breech presentation was confirmed during a 999 call commencing at 13:00. Paramedics arrived at scene at 13:07 and transfer to hospital was again advised and not accepted. The presenting part delivered at 13:14, there was then a 27 minute period before delivery of Sinon’s head causing a catastrophic hypoxic brain injury. He received resuscitation and was transferred to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital arriving at 49 minutes of age. At 57 minutes Sinon was found to have a heartbeat, he was ventilated and cooled but remained comatose and subsequently developed signs of encephalopathy and multi organ failure, a decision was made to provide palliative care on the 20th December and Sinon died at 05:15 on the 21st December 2021.   "",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows \n1. The University Hospitals of Birmingham NHS Foundations Trust (‘UHB’) has specific guidance covering home birth against medical advice in the form of ‘Birth Choices Guidance, CG1200, June 2021’ and ‘Homebirth Including Risk Assessment, CG1143, August 2021’.\n \n2. Specifically, Section 5 of the Birth Choices Guidance includes:\n \n“5.1 All women requesting birth outside of guidance must be referred for discussion to the consultant midwife via BadgerNet for decision-making regarding their birth choices.\n….\n5.7.  Where there are complexities that require the input of other professionals and if the woman remains undecided or voices a decisive choice to pursue a plan outside of Trust guidance a joint multiprofessional appointment must be arranged.\n5.8.  This appointment should include the consultant midwife; the woman’s named obstetric consultant and other relevant professionals/clinicians as needed. The consultant midwife will convene the multiprofessional team meeting with the purpose of ensuring that a comprehensive multiprofessional pregnancy and birth plan is formulated.\n5.9.  There may be occasions when the multiprofessional team cannot meet. In these circumstances it is acceptable for the multiprofessional team to see the woman separately. However, the team members must still agree a plan together and document this on the woman’s records.”\n \n3. Evidence given at the inquest pertaining to the current situation was that the system outlined in section 5.8 of the Birth Choices Guidance is not in operation at all. Evidence was given by UHB’s Community Matron that without the input of a Consultant Obstetrician at the multiprofessional appointment, things might be missed in the birth plan, and the information given by the Consultant Midwife and Community Midwives may not carry the same weight with the patient as hearing the opinion of the Consultant Obstetrician.

She complained of a 5-day history of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Raquel had a low oxygen saturation, a high respiratory rate and a tachycardia. The assessing doctor used the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC), to rule out the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism causing her symptoms. The PERC test was positive, and a D Dimer should have been carried out. This was not done. A diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was made, based upon a low haemoglobin and low MCV level. Raquel was admitted to hospital and suffered from periods of desaturation requiring medical review and assessment. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was not re-visited and further investigations, such as arterial blood gases were not carried out. In the very early hours of 25 June 2021, Raquel became critically unwell. She required escalation of her\ncare, but this was not provided until she was in a peri-arrest state at around 0330 on 25 June 2021. Raquel suffered a cardiac arrest at around 0400 and received resuscitation and thrombolysis. Sadly, there was no response to the emergency efforts and Raquel passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on 25 June 2021. Had Raquel received the D Dimer test on the 23 June 2021, in accordance with the Trust’s policy, this is likely to have triggered further investigations which would have resulted in a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and a treatment dose of lower molecular weight heparin.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \n1. There was a lack of thorough history taking and a number of assumptions were made on the basis of Raquel’s high BMI. There was an assumed chronic low oxygen saturation with no evidence that the doctors had checked the records available or asked the patient about her baseline. The oxygen saturations recorded in the Barts sleep apnoea clinic in 2015 and 2016 were noted to be 99% and 100%.\n \n2. There was a lack of escalation of monitoring following the NEWS score of 10. It is of concern that the NEWS policy was not complied with by the nursing staff.\n \nThere was disagreement between senior clinicians as to how the Trust’s PE policy should have been applied. The policy is often not used in accordance with the specific wording. For example, the requirement for pleuritic chest pain is often ignored in practice.

He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter’s home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter’s home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. \n1.      a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion’s GP had made a ‘very\nurgent’ referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this ‘very urgent’ referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.\n \nb. During the evidence it was accepted that ‘a’ above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board’s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.\n \nAn investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion’s death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 21 June 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Eifion Wyn Huws (DOB 25/4/59) who died on 10 June 2022.

John received this high dose from 21 February 2021 until his death on 26 June 2021. That is with the exception of a period between 7 and 13 June 2021 following an inadvertent reduction in dosage to 25mg whilst an in-patient at RCHT. John was discharged on 15 June 2021 after this dosage error. I found that John was medically fit at the time of discharge and that the dosage error did not contribute to his cause of death.\n \nJohn was re-admitted on 22 June with a history of vomiting and retching for 2 days before admission; I found on the evidence that this was the likely period when John suffered his perforated sigmoid colon. This was deemed inoperable. John did not respond to antibiotics and was discharged home on 25 June 2021 for palliative care. John died peacefully at home on 26 June 2021.\n \nI found on the evidence of the histopathologist [REDACTED], that steroid therapy was contributory to John’s cause of death, alongside John’s other conditions. I found on the evidence that it was not possible to distinguish between the multiple conditions contributing to, and causative of, the perforated bowel.\n \n[REDACTED] stated in evidence as follows:\n \n…steroid therapy increases the risks of gastrointestinal complications including ulceration and perforation of the stomach, duodenum and the colon and these are recognised complications documented in the literature. The mechanism is unclear but steroids are thought to impair the mucosal barrier which enables bacteria to penetrate. Steroid induced colonic perforation is more likely to occur in patients with diverticular disease and the deceased was noted at autopsy to suffer from diverticular disease. It is speculated that in diverticular disease there is a localised concentration of bacteria.\nAlso, if the patient is treated by high dose steroids, the signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic complications may be masked by the anti-inflammatory effects of the drugs. This may potentially lead to delays in identification of the drug induced complications, so potentially resulting in the patient presenting with advanced complications such as viscus perforation."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She was conveyed to Hull Royal Infirmary where CPR was ceased and she was declared dead."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. \n(1) On a Friday and Saturday night the Lowgate area of Hull city is exceptionally busy with people enjoying the night time economy. As such many are in drink. The area of Lowgate is open to traffic, it is also the location of a taxi rank. There is only one crossing facility (aside from at either end of the road), the road narrows significantly at one end.\n \n(2) Police raised concerns as follows:\n–          The road remaining open during a Friday and Saturday night.\n–          The number of pedestrians using the area.\n–          Many people in drink in the area having to cross the road.\n–          The road is a 30 mph.\n–          Lights of vehicles are distracting\n–          The location of the taxi rank, pedestrians having to navigate around the parked taxis, some with lights on, to enter the road. Taxis do 3 point turns in the road and any vehicle doing this is a danger to pedestrians.\n \n(3) Evidence was heard one doorman working in the area who stated “Having worked at the same location for some time, the area where the bars are on Lowgate is an accident waiting to happen. Members of the public are leaving the bars in a drunken state and they just wander into the road to cross, many of them not even looking for traffic on the road. Some vehicles travel down Lowgate far too fast given the evening activity” and another doorman stated “the road and both the footpaths at the location of the collision occurred on Lowgate are both very narrow. There is also a taxi rank outside O’Leary’s which doesn’t help as taxis were parked there at the time of the collision. I have seen numerous near misses over the years I have worked in the area. It is no exaggeration to say that there are between six to twelve incidents each night between cars and pedestrians, one thing which does not help and is also dangerous are taxis which do U turns in the road once they have collected their fare”.\n \n(4) The police had previously made recommendations and further felt that closing Lowgate to all through traffic on a Friday and Saturday evening, making Lowgate a total no stopping zone on an evening between certain hours, moving the location of a taxi rank onto nearby Alfred Gelder Street.\n \n(5) I note the statement from the local authority listed\n– They have erected 2 speed signs since the incident. Bearing in mind that this incident occurred with a vehicle travelling well within the limits, traffic is the concern not limited to the speed of vehicles.\n– The council was looking at developing a document that reviewed speed limits for the whole of the city centre. Lowgate has a special reason for being an area of concern and should be looked at as a priority and not in conjunction with all other city centre streets.\n– That engagement with the councils public transport department has commenced with the intention to relocate the taxi rank to Alfred Gelder street “but this requires consultation with the Hackney Carriage Association”. No indication was given regarding what was being done to facilitate this.\n– The council say that there are no resources to manage the road closure, despite acknowledging it is their responsibility. The fact the road is open at this time is a danger and I am concerned given the comments of the doormen that the danger is being underestimated.\n– Crossing facilities had been looked at but could not be positioned within a suitable distance.\n \n(6)  I am concerned that inappropriate weight has been given to the danger arising in this area and that without appropriate action further incidents will occur."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 2nd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rebecca Lisa KIRBY, aged 31 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – \n(1) During the 2½ years in which Charlotte’s mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2½ years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte.\n \nI heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.\n \nI am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.\n \n(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte’s referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so.\n \nI am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""[the details below are fictional]   \nOn 27 July 2021 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Charlotte Comer.

Mr Seaby was assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist [“SALT”]. A SALT Care Plan was in place with regard to his nutrition which included specific requirements that he be given only soft, moist and mashed food, with two specific exceptions and that he was to be supervised throughout meals on a one-to-one basis with a ten minute gap between food and drink and for ten minutes afterwards. The Care Plan stated it was “essential” the Plan was adhered to and specifically provided that if the requirements were not adhered to, Mr Seaby was at risk of aspiration and asphyxiation “which are potentially life threatening”. Evidence was heard that Mr Seaby was not always given food which complied with the Care Plan and he was not always provided with supervision in compliance with his Care Plan. On 21 May 2018, Mr Seaby’s food at lunchtime was not prepared in accordance with the SALT Care Plan.  Mr Seaby was not provided with the required one to one supervision during the lunchtime meal. During lunch Mr Seaby coughed while eating and brought some food back up. He cleared his throat and then appeared fine and finished the rest of his meal. At afternoon snack Mr Seaby brought up large amounts of phlegm and then coughed up anything he ate or drank. Mr Seaby was taken to see the General Practitioner by a member of staff who had not been with Mr Seaby during that day. No copy of Mr Seaby’s Daily Record was shown to the General Practitioner. Mr Seaby was given a working diagnosis of gastric reflux and his medication was changed. At teatime, Mr Seaby coughed/vomited his medication and yoghurt and drink. Mr Seaby vomited phlegm on two more occasions. The 111 service was called at 20.53 hours.\nThe out of hours Doctor was spoken to at 22.45 hours following which emergency services were contacted and Mr Seaby was taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where he died on 22 May 2018.

Hawkins Farm is a family-owned dairy farm. As part of the fabric of some of the buildings on the farm, pre-cast concrete panels were used extensively, predominately as external walls for barns or similar. Typically, the concrete panels, which weigh approximately 800kg, are placed between vertical reinforced steel joists (RSJs), secured to the RSJ by means of a metal bracket bolted to the concrete panel. On Hawkins Farm two concrete panels had been repurposed from another building to form a divide between a “collecting yard” (an area where cattle are held prior to be being encouraged into the milking parlour) and an adjacent barn where straw was stored, with one panel placed on top of the other, to form a wall that was approximately 6 feet in height. The concrete panels did not stretch between the two RSJs present. As a consequence, one side was secured using the above-described method, with the other side being secured using sections of steel “box” (hollow steel tubing) welded to the RSJ and “clipped” against the rear of the concrete panel using a metal bracket. On 30th January 2021, Mr Woods was in the collecting yard when the upper concrete panel that divided the collecting yard from the straw storage came away from its fixing, causing multiple injuries to Mr Woods, who was sadly confirmed deceased at the scene."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \n1.     During the inquest evidence was heard that:"",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 5th February 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Jamie Paul Woods, born on the 12th August 1980.

The time of the collision was around 5pm on a December afternoon meaning that this stretch of road was in deep darkness.\n \nWhen the collision occurred on the 5th November 2021, neither the illuminated bollard nor the streetlamp were in working order and were therefore unlit. Both officers from the collision unit gave evidence that this situation presented a danger to road users and pedestrians.\n \nA Traffic Management Officer has brought this situation to the attention of Hertfordshire County Council, Highways England (now National Highways) and National Power Networks (now UK Power Networks).\n \nDespite this, I heard evidence at the inquest that both the bollard and the streetlamp have still not been repaired and remain unlit even in the hours of darkness.\n \nI was not able to say on the balance of probabilities that the lack of lighting on the pedestrian island\ncontributed to Mr Easdale’s death as he was not using the crossing itself when he was struck. He crossed nearby, however, and it is possible that had there been illumination at that island the driver of the car would have seen him earlier and potentially avoided the collision.\n \nI am satisfied that the lack of working lights at this location on the B197 Digswell Hill poses a danger to road users and pedestrians.

However, they were hampered in their efforts for the following reasons:\n \n1.       Despite requesting additional nursing staff, the Bargeod ward was short-staffed when Mrs White fell. There did not appear to be any documented plan or procedure in place for how patients would be safely managed when it was not possible (because of staff shortage) to carry out the level of care for individual patients that they had been assessed as requiring.\n \n2.       The ward is L-shaped and the patients on the ward are managed in individual cubicles. Mrs White should have been in view of nursing staff as part of her Level 4 enhanced care (‘observation of cohorted patients’). However, it was not possible to provide the observations that Mrs White required because:\na.    Patients were inside cubicles and therefore out of sight of staff and,\nb.    The ward itself was L-shaped.\n \n3.       The Bargoed ward is a stroke ward and one where it is usual to see patients who have a high risk of falls and mobility difficulties. Prior to Covid-19 it was explained that staff would take patients who required the Enhanced Care to the dayroom so that they could be under the required observation. Since Covid-19, this had not been possible. To counteract the logistical difficulties faced by staff in observation of Enhanced Care patients on the ward it was explained that patients are now moved to their cubicle doorway for periods of the day so that they are in sight of nursing staff. This appeared to be ineffective because:\na.    The particular care needs/wishes of a patient may mean that is not suitable.\nb.    That only accounts for part of the day.\n \n4.       To further counteract the difficulties with observing patients on Enhanced Level 4 care it was explained that clip-on alarm sensors were used. There was evidence given that patients are able to simply unclip these sensors, rendering the system ineffective.\n \nA Falls Review Panel had noted that Providing Level 4 Enhanced Care on this ward was extremely challenging and that quality care at Level 4 was unachievable in a single room environment. It was noted that the Corporate Nursing Team had reviewed the Enhanced Care Policy in light of the fact it did not fit single room environment, however at the time of the inquest it did not appear from evidence received that a further plan to manage Level"",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On an investigation was opened on 22 June 2021 into the death of Mary Doreen White."",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 01 April 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. \n  \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   \n1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. \n  \n1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  \n \n1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.\n \n1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.\n \n1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the ‘application’). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as “essential.”\n \n1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\nSean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.\nThe next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.\nSean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter [REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.\nSean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was [REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed – incorrectly – single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition.

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:\n \nSean Gerard Duignan was a well respected, well liked and universally helpful base sergeant at the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit (South Base). On the 29th May 2021 he was arrested following reports of a vehicle being driven erratically and dangerously. A Bedfordshire Police sergeant visited him at his home to conduct what was initially to be a welfare check. Sean was intoxicated with alcohol and was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of drink or drug driving. He remained in custody until the following afternoon when he was released under investigations. Multiple and serial enquiries were made by members of the custody and health care staff at Milton Keynes Police Custody suite to determine his mental health and to keep him safe. Those checks were repeated on release. They were continued by the police federation representatives and his close friend [REDACTED]. All seemed well. The next day, a day off, Sean travelled to the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit where the South Base armoury is located. The armoury security was lax and had been for a prolonged period. The computer system used for electronic access was repeatedly failing but seemingly no coherent approach was taken to remedy this. The back up master armoury key was kept in a PIN protected locked box, but the PIN number was universally known. Because of an error in the computerised system an officer was allocated single point access when she should not have been. She unwittingly let Sean, whose own access to the armoury had been restricted without his colleagues being informed, into the armoury. He took a hand gun and ammunition, entered the base gym and shot himself in the head."",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 13, 2023.

He became less responsive, an ambulance was called and paramedics transported Mr Lawler down the stairs in a carry chair on stair tracks. He was fully immobilised on the ambulance. A CT scan at York District Hospital confirmed he had ankylosis of the cervical spine, a fracture at C4/C5 and dislocation of the facet joints at C4/C5. There was significant narrowing of the spinal canal. Mr Lawler was transferred to Leeds General Infirmary where he underwent an MRI scan on 12 August 2017 which confirmed significant spinal cord compression.
