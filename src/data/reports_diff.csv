His mother had risk factors – gestational diabetes, a congenital heart condition and heightened blood pressure. At 4 minutes of age Alfie was noted as “grunting”. At 03.55 observations were documented on the NEWTT chart. Two were in the amber category – respiratory rate of 72 rpm and Oxygen saturation of 88%. The Mother was concerned and there was cyanosis around the mouth and nose. Intermittent grunting was noticed. At a review noted up at 5am, having probably occurred at around 04.30, saturation was 89.93%. On re-testing with a monitor from the resuscitate it was found to be 97%. The assessment found that there were no other signs of respiratory distress. The evidence from the Trust has included that given the maternal risk factors, once the two amber category observation at 03.55 had been documented, antibiotics should immediately have been administered to Alfie on a pre-emptive basis. In the event antibiotics were not applied, nor was close monitoring implemented. Alfie’s temperature fluctuated. At 05.15 he was 37.5 degrees. By 14.00 he was 37 degrees. The fluctuation was to some extent influenced by environmental factors. He was noted as intermittently groaning at 06.30. There were complications with feeding. He underwent a tongue-tie procedure at 10.20. At 11.30 the complications were persisting. At around 16.45 Alfie was discharged home. He became increasingly unsettled, crying consistently. This worsened such that the parents called 999. Pre-alert to the Emergency Department of University Hospital of North Durham at 00.02 on 14 June 2022 stated that Alfie was in cardiac arrest. Despite intensive treatment, and a brief return of cardiac output at 00.40, Alfie declined and died at 01.50. The medical cause of death provided following postmortem was 1)a) severe congenital pneumonia and meningitis, b) suspected acute chorioamnionitis. Reflecting the concession in the evidence of the Trust witnesses, the omission of antibiotics from 03.55 on 13 June 2022 is more likely than not to have contributed directly to Alfie’s death and, but for this omission, he would not have died.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

He had a history of 3 falls in the previous few days which following an examination was considered to be attributable to a condition called postural hypotension. This condition results in a sudden drop of blood pressure when somebody stands up and can cause dizziness even temporary unconsciousness. The treating clinicians view, in respect of which I agreed, was that the postural hypotension and general frailty likely caused Ray’s falls noted over the previous few days.\n \nRay was admitted the following day onto the Linnett Acute Medical Unit (LAMU) and a CT scan undertaken revealed evidence of chronic subdural haematomas, indicative of previous head trauma more likely than not attributable to earlier falls, not necessarily those falls in the last few days. In keeping with the hospital’s falls policy, following his arrival on LAMU, Charge Nurse [REDACTED] who was starting the night shift, carried out a falls risk assessment amongst other assessments. Relying on information that was passed to him verbally at the  shift handover before 8 o’clock that evening, he was however only told and therefore recorded as part of that falls risk assessment that Ray had had 1 fall in the last 12 months. Whilst recognising that there was a risk of a fall the assessment did not trigger any of the higher levels of monitoring over and above 1 hourly care rounding such as ensuring that Ray was within line of sight or more importantly was within arm’s reach of a care worker.\n \nWhilst the plan was for hourly care rounding I noted that no such checks were made on Ray from 20:50 on 17th January 2023 until just after midnight on 18th January 2023, although it was not material in my view to the events that followed but was indicative as regards the working pressures faced by nursing staff on that shift.\n \nAt 00:45 on 18th  January  2023, Nurse [REDACTED] was called by another patient in the same bay as Ray and saw him stood next to his bed passing urine into a bottle. She recalls the night light was on and she could see him clearly. She observed him suddenly falling to the right not putting his hands out to break his fall and he fell hitting his head on the chair leg as he collapsed to the floor. Due to the postural hypotension Ray was being given IV fluids and this equipment was connected to his arm. I was not of the view that the equipment contributed to the fall and found as a fact that the fall more likely than not was attributable to Ray’s postural hypotension.\n \nAs a consequence of the fall, Ray was found to have suffered head trauma and in addition had fractured his right neck of femur in respect of which it was noted more likely than not it was an osteoporotic fracture. The fracture was repaired the following day on the 19th January 2023, however, Ray as a result of immobility and trauma sustained deteriorated and he began to develop swallowing issues. He also became generally more confused and ultimately, he developed an aspiration pneumonia from which sadly he died in The Great Western Hospital on the 25th January 2023.\n \nDuring  the Inquest  hearing I heard live  evidence  from  Charge  Nurse [REDACTED] who came across as a conscientious and caring Nurse. That having been said I did ask probing questions\nof Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  as regards the discrepancy between Ray’s pre-admission history and\nwhat was actually  recorded  as part of the falls risk assessment.   By way of background,  I  was\ntold that  LAMU  consisted  of a ward  with  36 beds.   Back  in January  2023  those  beds  were\noccupied by elderly patients. I was told following the arrival of a new Chief Nurse there had been improvements in relation to staffing levels and at the time of Ray’s fall Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  told\nme that there was  1 Senior Nursing Sister in charge, 5 Registered Nurses of which he was one,\n4 Health Care Assistants  and 2 enhanced Care Workers.    ""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""Falls in the hospital environment do happen and I am not saying that all can be avoided. That having been said what I have noted of late when dealing with these cases is an increase in the instances where as a result of my investigation, in relation to cases that I have been directly involved in, that I am making findings that more likely than not the falls could have been prevented and the injuries that were causative in relation to that individuals death, avoided.\n \nRay was a 96 year old gentleman who would have died had it not been for the fall at some point in the future. That may have been in a matter of weeks, months or even a few years but had it not been for the fall on the night of the 17th 18th January 2023 he would not have died as he did, in the circumstances that he did, on the 25th January 2023.\n \nDuring the course of the Inquest, I also heard evidence from Sister Jones and in addition to the challenge of getting the staffing levels commensurate to the patients needs and safeguarding patients there does appear to be an issue that causes me a concern as regards the ability to dynamically respond to a need for enhanced supervision especially entering into night shifts. Sister Jones when questioned was open and extremely candid in her answer that at those times nursing staff could not always support those additional needs in the short term because of the challenge to get additional personnel at short notice in circumstances where the nursing team were under pressure due to the complexities and demands of patient’s needs. There is in my view no flexibility and resilience within the system to dynamically adapt and respond to changing patients enhanced needs exacerbated by the fact that especially during the winter months these beds are mainly occupied by the elderly. It is easier during day shifts to respond but  there clearly appears to be an issue especially going into night shifts.\n \nThere were 2 issues here, firstly the initial falls risk assessment on LAMU which was not undertaken  taking advantage  of all available  information  which in  my  view led to an  incorrect\nassessment  of  Ray’s  supervision  needs.    His fall  was  observed  by  another  member  of the nursing staff and therefore my view was that only arm’s length supervision would have avoided the fall and that there were sufficient indicators to warrant this prior to the event occurring. The failure here in relation to the initial assessment was down to the volume of work and not in my view laziness or anything of that nature on the part of nursing staff.\n \nFlowing from the first issue a further issue relates to the resilience and the ability to respond dynamically with changing patients on the ward so as to ensure that vulnerable patients with a high degree of risk of falling, like Ray, are properly safeguarded.\n \n[REDACTED] in her evidence talked about an ongoing programme, the Enhanced Care Toolkit Framework, which I acknowledge is work in progress, in respect of which not only the family but also I am interested in hearing what steps the Trust intends to take to mitigate against a risk of further incidents occurring such as the fall that Ray had on the night of 17th/18th of January.\n \nThis report is also being sent to The Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care and the reason I have sent this to The Secretary of State is to highlight the issue and my concerns. Often when Regulation 28 Reports are submitted responses often come back from Government Departments as regards the increase in the amount of money that they are injecting into that particular public service. Coroners cannot  make recommendations but as we advance in time into yet another winter period, which will undoubtedly be challenging for frontline NHS personnel, combined with an ever-increasing elderly population whose care needs both physical and mental are more complicated and demanding, it is essential that when these vulnerable people come into the care of the state, that they are effectively safeguarded. I cannot see this winter being much different from last winter and at the moment and my concern is that potentially it could be worse. Whilst the focus of this report relates to a hospital environment, the challenges created by an increasing elderly population in terms of NHS and social care response affects those in the community as well.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \nThe focus of my concerns relates to the approach of your Trust to learning from deaths. Although Mr Barnes was not treated at the John Radcliffe Hospital, I concluded that he should have been transferred there, and that the delay in carrying out vascular surgery there contributed to his death. The Oxford Trust has been involved in this investigation almost from the start, and other Interested Persons involved in the investigation have attempted to work with your Trust to investigate the circumstances of Mr Barnes’ death.\n \nI have been assisted by investigation reports and statements from the Spire Dunedin Hospital, and Royal Berkshire Hospital. This, I am afraid, sits in stark contrast to the response and approach by the Oxford Trust.\n \nThe Oxford Trust has carried out no investigation. They did not co-operate with the offer to conduct a joint investigation with Royal Berkshire Hospital.\n \nThere is no recorded morbidity and mortality meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.\n \nThere is no recorded MDT meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.\n \nThere is no evidence of proposed changes beyond evidence in court during the inquest that “we are looking into this”. Whilst I accept entirely that a knee-jerk response, even following a tragic death, is not appropriate, it is now some 18 months since Mr Barnes’ death.\n \nEvidence from RBH and Spire Dunedin was consistent, namely that attempts to liaise with your trust and learn from this event jointly have been universally ignored.\n \nIt was also difficult for my office to obtain evidence for the inquest. We were provided with a joint statement, from three consultant vascular surgeons (only two of whom were clinically involved). It transpired that this statement was written by a clinical governance manager, and each of the witnesses who gave evidence was careful to tell the court that they did not agree with the wording of that statement. We subsequently received a statement from the consultant vascular surgeon in this case on the 29th of September, and from the clinical lead of vascular surgery some 5 days before the inquest started. We were also informed 11 days before the inquest started that the key vascular surgery witness would be on holiday abroad. This witness was summonsed in May 2023. He ultimately gave evidence by video link, but this was difficult technically, and arrangements would have been made for him to attend in person, had we been made aware of this holiday arrangement, even aside from the fact that he had been formally summonsed.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""I have on occasion referred to the deceased as Barney.

The summary document in Mr MORETON’s case was seen to be deficient in that it omitted his symptom of fever. It was heard in evidence a radiologist would need to telephone the department in question or go there to inspect the notes. Their awareness of a patient’s condition is based on a telephone call referral followed by a summary document which can be at odds with each.\n–  It is of concern that the use of telephone referral system and summary could contain errors and the radiologist must rely on this information, with no quick way to inspect a patient’s notes.\n–   The evidence also dealt with radiologists working in 2 hour triage shifts in a hectic environment where those clinicians receiving the referral seldom were the clinicians who carried out the imaging. The inference was the arrangement was susceptible to error.\n–  Over the course of the inquest evidence was heard on a number of issues where information passed to and from clinicians involved in Mr MORETON’s care was inaccurate and misleading.\n–  Assumptions were made that, Mr MORETON was improving clinically when a surgical opinion was sought, this was incorrect.\n–   It was assumed Mr MORETON would be referred for a surgical opinion by ED department clinicians, when in fact none took place.\n–  Clinicians in Newcastle Upon Tyne when asked for advice were under the impression treatment was working as it was mentioned his discharge from hospital was comptemplated\n– this was not the case.\n–   Overall I am concerned by the poor and misleading communications between clinicians, departments and Hospital Trusts on matters of vital importance to patient care.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 5th April 2023 an inquest was opened into the death of Brian David MORETON.

The inquest was told that delays of this length (9 hours) for patients who had been triaged to be seen within 60 minutes were not uncommon throughout the winter period across Greater Manchester and more widely.\n \nThe demand was due to the volume of patients and the number of staff available to see and treat them. The delay was compounded by the shortage of radiographers and radiologists nationally meaning that even when a decision is taken for a scan it can take some time 9 an hour in this case) for it to take place and then reported on.\n \nIn the time that Mrs Oldham was waiting to be seen she deteriorated very significantly meaning that by the time it was understood what the issue was she was very unwell and did not respond to conservative treatment which was all she was well enough for by that point.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 28th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Marianne Erika Oldham.

With only 2 carers on a shift, it is foreseeable that residents can and will be left unattended.

Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.\n \n1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.\n \n1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the ‘application’). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as “essential.”\n \n1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest. The application may well eliminate altogether the risk identified in the incident field.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 1 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John Holmes, aged 57.

Since that time, he had been under the care of the community mental health team with a period of care under the home treatment team in July 2021 following a short admission for a relapse in his condition. At his last review in September 2021, he was noted to be well but concern was expressed about lack of compliance with medication due to some side effects. On 02/12/21 he was noted by a resident at his shared accommodation to be hallucinating, having smashed a window and threated to eat the glass. Police and paramedics attended and he was taken to Good Hope Hospital emergency department where he arrived at 01.45. He was assessed by the mental health liaison service and a psychiatric doctor as needing a full Mental Health Act assessment which was undertaken at 11.30 on 03/12/21. The assessment concluded that he did require further treatment due to a relapse in his condition caused by non- compliance with his medication. He agreed to a voluntary admission, further assessment and recommencement of his medication. He remained in the Emergency department whilst attempts were made to find a bed. At the time there was a national shortage of mental health beds. Staff from the hospital notified the police that he had left the department at 13.41 and that he was at risk of harming himself. There was a failure to treat Mr Hamilton as a missing person at this time, a failure by the mental health services to refer him to the home treatment team for a safe and well check and he was not assessed by the street triage team. At 18.58 police were notified by his landlord that he had left his property following a mental health episode and he was reported to have drunk bleach. No action was taken in relation to this log. At 19.51 police found Mr Hamilton walking on the footpath alongside the dual carriageway near The Fort shopping village after a member of the public reported seeing a man walking in the road. Mr Hamilton reported to officers that he suffered from depression and was out walking to clear his head. Police noted that he was cold and wet and had recently been assessed at Good Hope Hospital and he agreed to be taken to Birmingham Heartlands hospital for further assessment. At the hospital he was triaged by a nurse and noted to be suicidal. He was taken to the escalation room to wait to be assessed. He was not seen again and was noted to be missing from the department at 05.28 on 05/12/21. It is not known when he left the department. There was a failure to report him missing at this time. On 06/12/21 the deceased was found by a member of the public who was walking his dog, in the middle of the river [REDACTED]  Stechford lying on his back on a rock. He was confirmed deceased at the scene by [REDACTED] at 12.20. His whereabouts since he left the emergency department on or around 4/5th December 2021 are unknown and whilst he had previously indicated suicidal ideation, his intentions at the time of his death are unknown. There were several failures in his care which amount to missed opportunities to help Mr Hamilton; however, it is not possible to say whether the outcome could have been different.\n \nFollowing a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be:\n1a Drowning 1b Psychosis""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
