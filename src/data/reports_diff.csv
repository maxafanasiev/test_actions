Tammy was assessed as being at high and ongoing risk of ingesting foreign objects, a risk which had materialised on many occasions prior to her death, and often lead to hospital admission. Her risk of self-harm by ingestion led to the lawful use of mechanical restraints, comprising of mittens, a bio belt, eyesight or arm’s length observations, controlled and supervised access to items when spending time out of her mittens, and a total restriction on Tammy having free access to personal items. On 22 March 2021, hospital staff provided Tammy was a twistable crayon to use while her mittens were removed. The twistable crayon had not been risk assessed or approved for use by Tammy’s MDT, who were responsible for setting her care plan. In those circumstances, the twistable crayon ought not to have been provided to her. If the crayon had been presented to the MDT, her Consultant Psychiatrist would not have approved its use as it would have posed an obvious risk of serious harm if ingested due to its size and plastic structure. Instead, alternative child-safe small wax crayons could have been used to meet the same therapeutic purpose. At this time, the Trust did not have any documented system that set out the requirements for the MDT to approve the use of risk items, but this was nevertheless an expectation on the MDT, which they failed to complete. There is no clear or consistent record of who was observing Tammy or what items she had been granted access to on 22 March 2021. Despite the crayon being noted as “missing” from the pack, no incident report was completed, nor was the Security Manager alerted or any ward level plan initiated to seek to locate the risk item. Tammy started to present with symptoms of a complication of swallowing the item the next day. She reported nausea after eating, vomiting and epigastric tenderness. Mental health staff escalated her symptoms to the physical healthcare team. Tammy reported to the Advanced Clinical Practitioner that she could feel the twistable crayon inside her. The ACP made a plan to monitor for any deterioration and to discuss with the GP the following day. She was not escalated for investigations at the local hospital despite the size of the missing item and Tammy reporting feeling it inside her.\nThe Trust failed to have in place a formal policy relating to the management of the ingestion of foreign bodies. This meant that staff were not all working to a clear plan of how to monitor for, detect and respond to the medical complications of ingesting foreign bodies. The MDT failed to have in place a care plan specific to Tammy’s risk of swallowing, setting out how this should be managed and escalated by ward staff. There was no continuing, co-ordinated investigation to seek to locate the twistable crayon. On the evening of 16th May 2021 Tammy was observed to be vomiting in her toilet and at the same time reaching into the toilet. When asked, Tammy reported that she had swallowed a toothbrush. An out of grounds visit was arranged to take Tammy to Bassetlaw District General hospital. Tammy was examined at Bassetlaw General Hospital and was given an x-ray at 01:33am on 17th May 2021 which did not reveal any foreign bodies. Tammy was booked for an ultrasound scan later that day but was discharged at approximately 9:30am and returned to Rampton Hospital before this could be completed.\nStaff seem to have taken the negative x-ray result as evidence that there were no foreign bodies in Tammy’s system. Many staff were unaware of the limitations of x-ray in relation to non-radiopaque items or the extent of the imaging.\nOn the evening of 4th June 2021 Tammy reported discomfort and anxiety due to constipation. Given the timing and symptoms we feel this is likely to be the beginning of Tammy’s deterioration. No actions beyond further observations are recorded to have taken place, staff appear to have taken Tammy’s constipation entirely at face value. There is no evidence that the twistable crayon was being considered at this point.\nTammy spent most of the day of 5th June 2021 in bed due to worsening symptoms. It is recorded that a mechanical restraint review was undertaken by the duty doctor, but it is unclear whether any physical examination of Tammy was undertaken at this point.\nBy the evening of 5th June Tammy’s temperature and heart rate had begun to spike and mental health staff became concerned. The same duty doctor was contacted during the evening by ward staff as Tammy continued to deteriorate. The duty doctor did not attend the ward or examine Tammy and advised ward staff to provide Tammy with paracetamol. This represents a missed opportunity to have recognised the deteriorating patient and to have sought medical attention.\nThere is no record at this point that Tammy’s symptoms were linked in any way to foreign body ingestion, despite Tammy voicing concern that she may have perforated her bowel. Tammy’s symptoms continued to worsen throughout the early hours of 6th June 2021, including high pulse rate and temperature, anxiety, abdominal pain and vomiting, escalating to projectile vomiting and apparent ‘faecal’ vomit.\nThe Hospital Trust failed to adhere to the NEWS2 Policy when Tammy was acutely unwell. NEWS2 was not recorded as frequently as required, at times the readings were incomplete, and the total score was not acted upon in accordance with the policy. This led to an underestimation of Tammy’s clinical risk, and multiple missed opportunities to have rendered care in an acute hospital which would probably have prevented her death\nThe physical healthcare team and the on-call Duty Doctor failed to recognise Tammy was a deteriorating patient and failed to take steps to arrange her timely transfer to an acute hospital for treatment of her perforated bowel.\nOver the weekend of 5-6 June 2021 there was a breakdown in communication between the ward staff, physical healthcare staff, duty doctor, and site management as to Tammy’s signs and symptoms which led to a delay in her being transported to hospital to receive treatment for her condition\nTammy continued to deteriorate throughout the morning of 6th June 2021, until shortly after 2pm when Tammy’s symptoms were recognised by the physical healthcare team to be so severe that an ambulance would be required to take Tammy to hospital. A number of miscommunications between staff, added to the lack of a clear escalation protocol for staff to follow, resulted in a delay to the ambulance being called, because staff were unclear who should call the medical emergency."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest I heard evidence giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nPoor Quality Acute Physical Healthcare in the mental health setting\nTammy’s death demonstrates a further example of a failure by medical staff to recognise a deteriorating patient and a subsequent delay in escalating for acute secondary care intervention.\nHer death comes after repeated concerns have been raised about the quality of the Trust’s physical healthcare service in secure settings since 2018 (when Angus Bowie died from sepsis due to a perforation), in 2019 (when Christopher Howard Smith died from a pulmonary embolus), in 2020 (when Alexander Braund died from a chest infection) and in 2021 (when Michelle Louise Whitehead died from Hyponatraemic Encephalopathy).\nAt each of those inquests, the Trust committed to improving the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings and yet the same poor quality has prevailed in Tammy’s care.\nThese are examples of preventable deaths and the similarity in themes across them is exceptionally worrying.\nAction needs to be taken at the most senior level to effect meaningful change to the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings at which the Trust provides services, recognising this class of patients as exceptionally vulnerable to deterioration as they are unable, either through mental health challenges and/or incarceration, to access healthcare services of their own volition.\n \nFailure to Adhere to the National and Local National Early Warning Score (version 2) Policy\nThis is a repeated theme identified at inquest and in previous Prevention of Future Death reports. Staff remained unclear at the inquest about how frequently vital signs ought to be taken, where and how to record the values, and what action should be taken depending on the score.\n \nA lack of robust policy relating to Ingestion of Foreign Bodies\nI heard evidence that the Trust is in the process of drafting a policy, but it became clear during evidence that the policy is not yet sufficiently robust.\nThe policy needs to cover the assessment of risk when access is permitted to risk items, where such a risk assessment is stored and who is responsible for its review of content, what to do when ingestion is\nsuspected including how this should be managed medically and what security measures need to be taken to locate the item.\n \n4. Emergency Medical Calls\nThere was significant confusion in this case as to who should call a medical emergency and how information should be relayed to the ambulance service. It had been recognised early in the day by the Security Team that Tammy may require an out of grounds medical transfer, but it was not until much later in the afternoon, when Tammy was in cardiac arrest, that an ambulance was called. The Security Team expected the physical healthcare team to place the call, the physical healthcare team expected the ward to place the call due to proximity to the patient.\nEvidence called at the inquest established continued confusion amongst staff as to how an emergency should be managed.\n \nThis appears to be a training issue."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 13 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Tammy Mary Louise WATKINS, aged 36, which concluded by inquest held before me sitting with a Jury between 9 and 20 October 2023.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 March 2024.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nThere was evidence that staff at Conway House were significantly concerned for Mr Cork’s welfare, which is why he was deemed as ‘at risk’. As a result of being ‘at risk’ I was told that welfare checks were required to be undertaken, at least every 24 hours. Such checks required a staff member to physically see and interact with Mr Cork or, in the alternative, to telephone him and speak to him. Welfare checks were then required to be recorded on a spreadsheet. Despite this, I was told in evidence that welfare checks would only be recorded if the resident in question was actually ‘seen’ by the staff member undertaking the check; this raises the concern that there is disparity about what constitutes a welfare check and what will or will not be recorded.\n \nI heard evidence that prior to Mr Cork being found unresponsive in his room on 22 May 2023, the last recorded welfare check for Mr Cork was during the early shift of Saturday 20 May 2023. The concern here is that Mr Cork, despite being required to have welfare checks at least once every 24 hours, was not properly checked upon for between 36- 48 hours prior to his death.\n \nA night project worker at Conway House told me in evidence that they had opened Mr Cork’s door at about 20:35 on Sunday 21 May 2023, but did not enter the room to see or assess Mr Cork. The only reason for opening the door appears to have been the arrival of the ‘EMS team’ who were required to check that Mr Cork was at home for the purposes of conditions imposed by the criminal justice system.\n \nHaving heard what they believed to be snoring, the staff member closed the door and left. This fact was verified by Metropolitan Police Officers who checked CCTV footage as part of their initial investigation following Mr Cork’s death. The concern here is that staff made assumptions that the ‘snoring’ noise was coming from Cork’s room and not an adjoining room, and that the noise was snoring, without investigating further. This was a missed opportunity to properly check on Mr Cork’s welfare, as required.\n \nIn evidence, I was taken through the spreadsheet that is used to record all checks and/or welfare checks required for any residents of Conway House. The record system appears to have been a basic Microsoft Excel spreadsheet devised by staff. I was told that the computer and/or spreadsheet often ‘crashed’, which led to data sometimes not being able to be recorded. I also observed that some fields of the spreadsheet were often left blank. Staff undertaking and recording checks regularly appeared not to input their name(s) or the time at which checks were undertaken. I was also told that while there was some training on how to undertake and record welfare checks, this was not needed because it was a simple task.\n \nThe concern here is that the recording system for welfare checks may not be adequate and that the approach taken to filling in the data required on the spreadsheet varied from one staff member to another, which may also indicate that there is a training need.\n \nI was told in evidence that the same spreadsheet is still used to record any checks and/or welfare checks required for residents. I was told that the issues identified with a lack of checks for Mr Cork were caused by the fact that there were a significant number of agency staff on duty and that Conway House no longer uses agency staff. However, the staff member that opened Mr Cork’s door at 20:35 (without entering the room or seeing Mr Cork) on 21 May 2023 and subsequently found him unresponsive on the morning of 22 May 2023 was a substantive member of staff.\n \nI was not reassured that any proper investigation into these issues had been undertaken or that any action(s) required to bring about improvements in the system of undertaking and recording welfare checks have been identified and/or implemented."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 15 June 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of NICHOLAS CORK, then aged 57 years.

I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of these Interested Persons.\n \nI also received evidence from the Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken in their area of responsibility to address my concern detailed at a (above). This evidence has not allayed my concern in relation to a (above).\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nEvidence received from the police officers accompanying Mr. EVANS during his attendance at Frimley Park Hospital provided that:\n \na. Mr. EVANS presented with a large fresh cut on his arm and also cuts on his legs which were identified by him as being from self-harm with hospital staff noting that the larger mark on the arm might require stitching.\nPolice officers stated that Mr. EVANS was open with hospital staff about his feelings of self-harm depression, and thoughts of ending his own life. Officers further recalled that hospital staff noticed and commented on the self-harm marks on Mr. EVANS’ arms, including whilst staff were dressing a recent self- harm wound on Mr. EVANS’ left arm.\nOfficers also recalled Mr. EVANS commenting when offered food by hospital staff that he would rather starve to death.\nOne of the accompanying police officers expressed surprise at the fact that Mr. EVANS was not subject to a mental health referral or assessment, in the context of him commenting to multiple hospital staff members about his self-harm actions and ideation.\n \nAn emergency department consultant at Frimley Park gave evidence which suggested that no mental health assessment was or would have been necessary where Ryan’s presenting complaint was recorded as chest pains rather than of self- harm and/or suicidal ideation. Although self-harm had been noted in the records, no explanation could be provided for why Ryan’s suicidal ideation had not been recorded.\n \nThe consultant was further questioned in relation to the 2006 NICE Guidelines “Self-Harm: The short term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care” which are national guidelines that ought to feed into practice at the hospital.\n \nThese guidelines provide that “Following triage patients who have self-harmed should receive the requisite treatment for their physical condition, undergo risk and full psychosocial needs assessment and mental state examination, and referral for further treatment and care as necessary” and “All people who have self harmed should be offered an assessment of needs, which should be comprehensive and include evaluation of the social, psychological and motivational factors specific to the act of self-harm, current suicidal intent and hopelessness, as well as a full mental health and social needs assessment.”\n \nEvidence received during the course of the Inquest was not able to reconcile the contradiction between the NICE guidelines on self-harm and Mr. EVANS having had no mental health assessment despite obvious signs of self-harm and further evidence of disclosure of suicidal ideation.\n \nThe jury in their Narrative Conclusion found that ‘Despite evidence of self-harm, no mental health assessment was carried out at this point.’\n \nI remain concerned as to how such a situation would be avoided if a patient presented again in similar manner to Mr. EVANS. The additional evidence on PFD matters provided by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust does not refer to or address the NICE guidelines on self-harm or explain what would now be done differently were a patient such as Mr. EVANS were to be seen again.\n \nThe Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust additional evidence refers to matters being in the process of introduction and new referral criteria with Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, but this does not explain how this would prevent the future risk of a patient such as Mr. EVANS leaving the hospital without a mental health assessment."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 4th April 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ryan John EVANS.

While in the care of the Emergency Department Mr HOLGATE sustained a fall. A CT scan showed evidence of a traumatic head injury, Mr HOLGATE was deemed very unwell and not for surgical intervention. Mr HOLGATE deteriorated further and another CT scan showed an ongoing bleed with mass shift which had not been evident on the original CT. Mr HOLGATE was reviewed again and still deemed not fit for intervention and placed on a palliative care pathway. Mr HOLGATE died on 1st November 2023."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nThis matter was referred to this court and is a case where it is entirely suitable to proceed to inquest without the need for a post mortem examination.\nEvidence regarding the cause of death will be provided at inquest by way of a statement from the treating clinician with the CT scans showing the sequence of events.\nThe family indicated that it had been Mr HOLGATE’s wishes, and indeed something that they supported, for his body to be donated for medical science/research.\nThis process has long been a way of researching illness and disease as well as assisting in the training of doctors. It is recognised as fundamentally important to progressing the understanding of medicine and treatment.\n \nEach receiving medical research/training establishment have a criteria, one of which is that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, the deceased should not have undergone a post mortem examination. This is understandable, and exceptions allow in certain instances this to be waivered.\n \nIn Mr HOLGATE’s case the local medical research/training establishment had full capacity and were unable to accept him. As is normal the family/Coroners Officer were referred to an alternative establishment at Nottingham.\n \nNottingham politely declined, they indicated that they were prevented from accepting due to what appears to be an anomaly in the law. As the matter was subject of a coronial inquest they could not accept the donation.\n \nIn non-inquest matters reported to the coroner, where post mortem examination is not required and the coroner is content there is no requirement to investigate further, a form A is signed to indicate this and the coroner is then able to return the deceased back in to the care of their family/personal representative/funeral director to allow funeral arrangements or body donation to proceed. In these instances medical research/training establishments are able to accept donation.\n \nWhere a coroner is likely to hold an inquest in a situation where a post mortem is not necessary as a cause of death statement can be obtained and the coroner is content that there is no further need to retain the deceased for any further examination, the coroner must also ensure that the deceased is returned back to the care of the family/personal representative/funeral director as soon as practicable. This normally allows for funeral arrangements to proceed.\n \nIn both instances the coroner authorises release of the deceased, in majority of cases the person is cremated ie they will not be available nor required for the coroner, even when the matter is proceeding to inquest. All relevant enquiries have to be made and sufficient evidence obtained before the release is authorised."",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.\n \nThis may be by way of clarification or guidance if S11 overrides the need to register before acceptance.\n \nDonations of this kind further the advancement of medicine, treatments and training and as such prevent many deaths.

She sustained multiple injuries incompatible with life. At the time she was under the care of Oxleas NHS Trust Adults’ Community Mental Health Team. She believed she had early onset dementia which was being investigated. She had poor sleep and low mood in the months prior to her death but there was no formal diagnosis for her mental condition at the time of her death."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""British Transport Police made a referral to the Older Adult Community Mental Health Team, Oxleas NHS Trust, on 25th January 2023, following an incident at Hither Green Station, when Mrs Porter had attempted to end her life by standing in front of an incoming train, which stopped.\n \nThe 9 page referral included information that Mrs Porter: “…made a deliberate act to jump onto the tracks in front of a train” and “Q: In your opinion, due to proximity of lethal means if it hadn’t been for certain actions would death or serious harm have occurred? A:Yes”. The summary of the incident on page 4, was only partially complete, in that it did not include the information that the train had stopped. It stated she: “decided to jump down on to the tracks to take her own life but then changed her mind and came back onto the platform”.\n \nThe inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report, prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust Staff relied on the summary of the incident, both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for example the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police).\n \nThe Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to Mrs Porter. Their Report stated: “Had the referral from BTP to OACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of the incident on 25 January 2023, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been  determined as high, and a more robust plan of care implemented to mitigate against these risks, that would have been immediately shared with her family”. It was established at Inquest that had the full details of the incident on 25th January 2023 been understood – ie that Denise intended to take her life and this was only prevented by the slowing and halting of the train – that the psychiatrist would have referred her either to the Intensive Home Treatment Team (with consent) or for a Mental Health Act assessment (if no consent had been forthcoming).\n \nThe Trust’s Report stated: “There were no identified service delivery issues that impacted on the services’ ability to offer care and treatment”. However, in oral evidence, the Trust’s witness agreed this was inaccurate, following reflection upon the missed opportunities of investigating the events of 25th January 2023.\n \nThe Trust was unable to provide the Inquest with information to satisfy my concern that the Trust has robust systems in place to avoid the risk that staff may rely upon short summaries from British Transport Police, rather than scrutinising all the information contained within a referral and making relevant inquiries if the reporting is ambiguous or incomplete.\n \nIn this case, the Trust was clearly of the view that the detail was significant but was overly reliant upon partial information which resulted in missed opportunities for appropriate referral."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 23 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Denise Jane PORTER.

Mr Campion was also known to drink alcohol to excess, described by family as a functioning alcoholic. On 1 July 2022 Mr Campion contacted the crisis teams indicated he was going to overdose and then proceeded to overdose on prescription medication. He was conveyed to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital where he was treated for the overdose and seen by the mental health team. A mental health assessment was not carried out and he was discharged with the advice to contact the crisis team if needed. On the evening of 20 July 2022 Mr Campion spoke to a friend who confirms Mr Campion appeared intoxicated but appeared to be his normal self. In the early hours of 21 July 2022, Mr Campion made contact with the Psychiatric Crisis Team threatening to take an overdose of [REDACTED] and his heart medication, he also stated that he had been drinking vodka. In the light of their concerns the Crisis Team contacted the North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) by 999 at 2.10am. The initial call was allocated a category III classification (attendance within one hour and 90% of calls within two hours). The Service was stated to be very busy at that time. It was four and a half hours from the original call before the case was reviewed by a clinician but there does not appear to have been a welfare check phone call at that time. It was not until six hours after the initial call that an ambulance was allocated and when the crew arrived at his home address at 8:26am they found Mr Campion deceased in the living room. The post mortem and toxicology investigation found the cause of death to be mirtazapine and alcohol toxicity. Mirtazapine is an antidepressant medication and has a number of common side- effects including feeling sleepy and in overdose it can lead to reduced consciousness and coma. The TOXBASE guidance notes that peak plasma concentrations occur approximately two hours after ingestion. It also states that the effects on the central nervous system may be enhanced or prolonged following co-ingestion of other central nervous system depressants including alcohol. Though it is unknown as to exactly what time Mr Campion took the overdose of mirtazapine, in the opinion of the expert the delay of over 6 hours from the initial call to the ambulance service to an ambulance crew being allocated and arriving on scene is very significant. It is more likely than not if Mr Campion had been in hospital at a point at least two hours after ingestion he would have survived this event. There were a number of missed opportunities in the care and treatment of Mr Campion. The family contact details noted by the mental health team were incorrect. There was very little evidence of family involvement throughout the mental health interactions, this being a critical and crucial element of the mental heath treatment plan. On 1 July 2022 a full mental health assessment should have been carried out, which is likely to have resulted in immediate support for Mr Campion and measures been put in place for further referrals to the appropriate mental health services. On 21 July 2022 the ambulance call handler did not give the time estimate of the ambulance to the crisis team member; that said the numbers for the family were incorrect and so would not have led to anyone being contacted. The delay in the ambulance dispatch prevented Mr Campion receiving medical treatment and further psychiatric assistance. The outcome for Mr Campion has been adversely impacted due to the  demand on the ambulance service . At the time of the 999 call on 21st July 2022 NWAS were operating at Level 4 of the Plan (PSP) experiencing high demand, acute pressures and high numbers of waiting calls. The options for the emergency services were extremely limited and an ambulance was deployed at the earliest opportunity. Mr Campion clearly consumed an excessive amount of prescription medication whilst under the influence of alcohol and as such his state of mind is likely to have been impaired. Taking account of his past actions, particularly that of 1st July 2022, it is more likely than not he carried out the act not with the intention of taking his own life."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

When the lesion continued to trouble him in May 2020, he returned to his GP who referred him to dermatology, where a further excision was performed and analysed and was found to be melanoma. An ultrasound scan showed that the melanoma had metastisised to his lymph nodes, chest wall and lungs. Despite immunotherapy and targeted oral therapy, the melanoma continued to metastasise and in June 2022, scans showed that it had spread to Gregor’s brain such that his condition was terminal.

Nevertheless, it is of concern that the barrier to undergoing a complete procedure, including histological analysis, appears to be one of cost. Anecdotal evidence received at inquest from treating clinicians was that the further costs associated with histological or other review, which on the NHS would be routinely included within the procedure at no charge to the patient, was a common disincentive to patients who would regularly opt not to have the further tests carried out.\nWhile it is acknowledged that there have to be criteria for routine and non-emergency procedures to be conducted on the NHS, my concern relates to the disparity in what is included within the treatment when undertaken privately (where histological analysis is a separate and additional cost) and what is routinely included as part of NHS treatment\nIt therefore seems to me that there is a risk of future deaths if patients not meeting the NHS referral criteria, who have to pay for procedures to be carried out privately, opt on cost grounds not to have the histological analysis which would otherwise be provided on the NHS at no charge, as it is well-established fact that earlier detection and treatment is crucial in minimising the risks of developing metastatic cancers including melanoma."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 29 July 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Gregor Patrick Edward Lynn aged 24 years.

There was no clear cause or diagnosis for the seizures but it was felt that he was suffering from electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. In November 2022 a decision was made to commence him on high dose steroids, a known consequence of which was immunosuppression. He developed signs of chicken pox on Friday 17 February 2023 and was brought to his community paediatric appointment on 20 February 2023 but not seen and assessed as he was known to have a contagious disease. He was seen later that day by a nurse at his general practitioner surgery and was seen and sent home. A later discussion between a general practitioner at the surgery and the community paediatrician led to a referral to the paediatric assessment unit at Ipswich hospital. The unit was busy and an appointment was not made until the following morning. By 11am on 21 February 2023 Nuel had deteriorated further and his parents had to support and carry him to the paediatric assessment unit arriving at 11.05am. Observations taken at 11.30am revealed he was pyrexial, tachycardic and tachypnoeic but the sepsis pathway was not followed. He was prescribed paracetamol at 12.15 and seen by a paediatric registrar who did not consider the sepsis protocol should be initiated as there was a clear cause for his symptoms i.e chicken pox. The plan was made to observe him, recheck his observations and if he had improved to send him home with oral Acyclovir. At 13.20 he remained pyrexial and tachycardic and his respiratory rate was still high at 32 and he was prescribed Ibuprofen. By 15.30 his temperature had come down and his heart rate had settled but was still high at 118, as was his respiratory rate at 29. He was also unable to mobilise having previously not being limited with his mobility. He was confused but this was considered to be his usual presentation due to his neurodegenerative condition. The doctor who planned to discharge him did not discuss him with a Consultant and was not aware he needed a wheelchair to leave hospital having had no issues with his mobility prior to the onset of his current viral illness.\nHe was taken home by his parents and was unable to swallow his oral medication and took very little by way of fluids. He deteriorated the following day and collapsed shortly before 2pm. His parents called emergency services and police and paramedics attended.

Ian fell so that he landed in front of the toilet block in the car park, suffering very serious injuries. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted at the scene by lifeguards and off duty doctors, before being conveyed to RCHT by ambulance. Ian was examined at hospital and found to have sustained multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs.\n \nOn 4 June 2022, Ian was transferred to Derriford Hospital for treatment of complex spinal fractures, under the neurosurgical team.\n \nOn 5 June 2022 Ian suffered a medical episode which developed into a critical incident in which Ian deteriorated rapidly and required life saving measures.\n \nOn 6 June 2022 Ian was taken to theatre for spinal surgery. Before surgery, the critical care flexible endotracheal tube was replaced by an armoured tube. After surgery, the anaesthetic team commenced an airway exchange, namely removing the armoured tube which had been inserted for the operation, in order to replace it with the more flexible critical care tube. However, having removed the armoured tube, the team were unable to insert the flexible tube despite repeated attempts. Ian then started to desaturate due to lack of oxygen. The Consultant Anaesthetist proceeded to jet ventilate Ian, the first jet was uneventful, the second resulted in massive neck swelling, Ian went into cardiac arrest. The medical team then resorted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency tracheostomy. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 20-25 minutes During this time Ian suffered hypoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen.\n \nOver the following days, Ian suffered seizures on the intensive care unit and an MRI on 9 June 2022 showed extensive changes consistent with hypoxic brain injury.\n \nOn 15 June 2022, Ian’s care was transitioned to end–of-life care.\n \nIan died in the intensive care unit at Derriford hospital at 17:10 on 15 June 2022."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nThere was an error of omission in record keeping and in handover from critical care to surgery, and that this error likely contributed to Ian’s death.\nThere was no entry in Ian’s hospital notes to indicate the full extent of the critical incident of 5 June 2022.\nThere was a lack of information on handover from critical care to the surgical team regarding the full extent of the critical incident of the 5 June 2022. There was a verbal handover which was brief and vague. There was no formal written handover process highlighting significant events.\nThe error of omission was unexplained and has not been investigated by the NHS. The evidence regarding the error of omission came to light after the completion of the NHS investigation into Ian’s death. The Consultant Anaesthetist involved in Ian’s operation discovered the fact of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 on a later examination of ventilator data. The data indicated that Ian deteriorated significantly, that he was close to a cardiac arrest and the critical care team saved his life.\nThe surgical and anaesthetic team had no reason to suspect a secondary brain injury. The team had no information on Ian’s neurological status. Ian is likely to have suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the critical incident of 5th June. This will have undermined his resilience and ability to physically withstand the rigors of spinal surgery and airway exchange.\nHad the surgical and anaesthetic team known of the extent of the critical incident of 5 June, the operation would have been delayed and further tests and assessments undertaken. The anaesthetic team may have opted for elective tracheostomy if the full circumstances of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 had been known. An elective tracheostomy would have led to\na different outcome because it would have avoided the complications that ensued from the attempted airway exchange.\nI note the NHS Investigator and the Investigatory Panel both recommended that action is required for the handover of complex patients. The panel recommended as follows:\nMore robust and formalised handover of complex patients before transfer to theatre, to include review of airway management, cardiopulmonary status, potential avenues of deterioration and any significant events during admission\nThe Trust had chosen not to accept this recommendation but at the time the Trust made that decision it was not aware of the extent and significance of the error of omission."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 7 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of 51 year old Ian Jacka.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\nPre-amble\n \nThe inquest heard evidence to confirm that Mrs Aston appropriately underwent a total gastrectomy at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust on 29 September 2021. There are no concerns about the surgery, care provided at or discharge from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.\n \nThe inquest heard that on 15 October 2021, whilst at her home, Mrs Aston began to experience pain in her abdomen. The pain became progressively worse and 999 was called. East Midlands Ambulance Service attended. The court heard evidence that, on the balance of probabilities, the worsening pain was likely to be the start of a splenic rupture.\n \nOn 15 October 2021 at 15:31hrs Mrs Aston arrived at Kettering General Hospital, having been transported there by emergency ambulance. The inquest heard that Mrs Aston was “in extremis” on arrival at Kettering General Hospital which is perhaps the most unwell anyone can be. Mrs Aston needed life-saving surgery to stop her bleeding internally.\n \nThe inquest heard that Mrs Aston should have been categorised as a high-risk “life or limb” Category 1 patient when she arrived at Kettering. As a Category 1 patient Mrs Aston should have been operated on within an hour of her arrival to stop the bleeding, however, instead of undergoing surgery she was placed on the ICU at Kettering where she remained for almost 24 hours, until the afternoon of 16 October 2023, when she was transferred to the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust.\n \nOn 16 October 2021 at 16:00hrs Mrs Aston arrived at the Leicester Royal Infirmary. Ten minutes later, at 16:10hrs Mrs Aston was in theatre undergoing a splenectomy.\n \nMrs Aston remained very unwell post-operatively and on 18 October 2021, after discussions with her family, the decision to palliate her was taken, Mrs Aston died at 12:40hrs at the Leicester Royal Infirmary.\n \nThe decision making at Kettering\n \nThe inquest heard evidence to confirm that the decision making as to whether a patient is operated on or not is entirely the remit of the surgical team at Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust.\n \nThe evidence around why the decision not to operate on Mrs Aston at Kettering was taken that night is confused. Lack of theatre capacity at Kettering was often cited as one of the reasons and the possible complexity of the surgery required being cited as another.\n \nThe On Call Consultant Surgeon who made the decisions relating to Mrs Aston at Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust on 15 and 16 October 2021 did not attend the inquest as he now lives abroad so was unable to provide clarity around his decision making.\n \nThe inquest heard the following evidence about the splenectomy surgery that Mrs Aston needed that night:\n \nIt is possible to undertake a splenectomy at Kettering General Hospital;\nUndertaking a splenectomy was something that the On Call General Surgeon at Kettering General Hospital that night was capable of (further, even if the surgeon had reservations about the possible complexity of the surgery a highly experienced surgeon from the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust had offered to drive to Kettering to perform the surgery or assist with it, unfortunately despite his repeated offers of assistance he was told there was no theatre space available at Kettering);\nNo emergency surgeries were undertaken at Kettering General Hospital on the night in question and therefore there was theatre capacity at Kettering General Hospital on 15 October 2021 into 16 October 2021 for Mrs Aston to have had her surgery.\n \nConcerns\n \nSurgical decision making – I am concerned about the fact that the decision about whether to operate on a patient or not lies with one single surgeon with seemingly no checks or balances around their decision making. It concerns me that all of the witnesses at the inquest agreed that Mrs Aston needed immediate life-saving surgery when she presented to Kettering General Hospital yet there was no challenge to the decisions made by the on-call surgeon not to operate.\n \nTrust investigations into Mrs Aston’s care – I am gravely concerned about the seeming inadequacies in the investigation and/or incident reporting processes at Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust. The inquest was advised that a DATIX incident report was not raised in relation to Mrs Aston’s care or death.\n \nI am concerned about the fact that Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust did not look into the care provided to Mrs Aston until such time as the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust contacted them about the inquest.\n \nI am further concerned about the fact that when Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust did look into the care provided to Mrs Aston they did so on the assumption that the clinical decision making had been appropriate, this makes the exploration of the care provided somewhat otiose.\n \nThe Trust’s exploration of the care provided to Mrs Aston failed to identify the fact that surgery should have been undertaken within an hour and the fact that, despite some of the assertions to the contrary, it would have been appropriate and possible to undertake that life-saving surgery at Kettering General Hospital.\n \nThe failure to properly investigate led to the wholly untenable situation where the Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust were alerted for the first time to the questionable clinical decision making and the potential errors in care at the inquest, which took place some 24 months after death (due to witness availability).\n \nI am concerned that the lack of robust critical analysis and investigation of the clinical decision making and care provided to Mrs Aston at Kettering General Hospitals NHS Trust before her death has caused a delay to, and led to missed opportunities to learn lessons that are vital to patient safety.\n \nMy concerns relating to the inadequacy of the Trust’s exploration of the care provided to Mrs Aston and the risks related to that go far beyond just the care provided by the Surgical Team at Kettering General Hospital NHS Trust. The risks have the ability to prevent learning, therefore negatively impact upon patient safety, across the entire Trust."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 21 October 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lindy Lyanne ASTON aged 67.

Katie also had a temperature of 40°c on admission to the emergency department; this, and the evidence of early muscle injury, led the treating ICU team to conclude that Kate was likely to be suffering with serotonin toxicity.\n \nGiven the ongoing risk of serotonin toxicity, and following Toxbase advice, no infusion of the opiate drug [REDACTED was administered to Katie during days 1, 2 or 3 of her ICU admission. At this stage, the venlafaxine was felt to still to be her system, and the plan was to support Katie whilst this cleared, and to treat her evolving aspiration pneumonia with antibiotics. Where additional sedation was required remifentanil was used.\n \nOn day 4 of Katie‘s ICU admission (19 May 2021) a decision was made to switch the remifentanil infusion to a [REDACTED] infusion as per usual ICU practice.

William was conveyed to Southend Hospital where he was discharged home four hours later with no assessment of his recent symptomatology and no change to his medications. Family contacted the GP service for advice and chased a referral to the asthma and allergy services. No changes were made to William’s medication until 4 November 2020 when he was prescribed a steroid preventer inhaler at the request of the asthma nurse and follow-up with Southend Hospital. William was lost to follow-up at Southend Hospital following a consultant appointment on 14 November 2020. The Asthma and Allergy Service comprised of telephone calls of no more than five minutes with no contact after 1 February 2021 until 21 May. The GP prescribed four short doses of oral steroids for exacerbations of his asthma in December 2020, February, April and 19 May 2021 that were insufficient to effectively manage obviously poorly controlled asthma in a picture of vastly excessive reliever inhaler prescriptions and the absence ongoing of preventer medication.\nOn 21 May 2021 the asthma nurse did not review or escalate the increased salbutamol inhaler use information shared. The advanced GP nurse practitioner reviewed William’s condition on 25 May 2021 at the request of the GP following the final prescription of steroids and confirmed that William’s asthma remained very poorly controlled but failed to escalate concerns. As a consequence of multiple failures, William suffered an inevitable life-threatening asthma attack on the night of 29 May 2021 and crew arrived at approximately 00:18. Ambulance Crew could not secure William’s airway when he went into respiratory arrest with a missed opportunity by ambulance crew to administer intramuscular adrenalin in the presence of a strong pulse that probably would have delayed the cardiac arrest and possibly saved his life. William went into cardiac arrest at approximately 00:35 with further crew on scene and chest compressions commenced.\nIntravenous adrenalin was administered at approximately 00:45 when William was in the ambulance and resuscitation continued until HEMS met the ambulance en-route to hospital.

She was found suspended [REDACTED]. The evidence indicted that she had secured the ligature herself before lowering herself into it. The evidence established that she had died at some point in the early hours of the morning – it was known that she was not sleeping. There were no suspicious circumstances concerning the death. The Deceased was diagnosed with EUPD and ADHD and was receiving therapy and support from the community mental health team and from her GP in respect of physical pain. She had been struggling in the months prior to her death with emotional dysregulation, reflective of her EUPD but influenced in part by a programme of gradual reduction in her medications, which she had requested. The evidence was not able to establish that the change in her medication had chemically caused an instability in her emotions (and it was recognised that both the long term and concomitant use of her various prescription medications were clinically indicated and without contra-indications). However, the psychological impact of reduction, coupled with increasing social stressors and an increasingly subjective feeling of isolation, abandonment and lack of being heard in the last few weeks of her life are believed to have all contributed to an increasing internal narrative which led, on the evening of 24 June 2022, and without warning, to a spontaneous and impulsive act against an increasing background of emotional dysregulation. There was no evidence to indicate that her death had been an accident or a cry of help (given the timing and nature of the act). In the context of her complex diagnosed conditions however, the risk of dangerous and impulsive acts with impulsive intent was recognised, but not in all the circumstances expected."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n1. It was recognised in evidence and in submission to the Court by representatives of the Trust, that there is and remains a fragmented relationship between mental health and physical health services, with little inter-service connectivity. It was recognised that ideally services for those with both mental and physical health diagnoses should be connecting in a seamless, timely and collaborative manner – specifically through the joint commissioning of services, to support patients of all ages.\n \nNationally it is recognised that co-morbidity, especially with ADHD (as was the case in this death), impacts on both treatment compliance and treatment response. Whilst local initiatives have been explored by SHFT and by the ICB – Project Fusion I understand is such an example – much of the development of such services falls outside of scope and commissioning. Consequently, there is a significant and pressing need for connectivity between mental health services and those services supporting neurodivergent patients.\n \nIt was noted in evidence e.g. that SHFT do not currently have a comorbidity policy that would provide guidance to staff regarding patients who have a mental health condition and a learning difficulty. There are no ADHD services within SHFT or other NHS organisations within the Southampton (or in fact the wider Hampshire) area – save for private clinics, which many cannot afford.\n \nThe facts in this case have highlighted that progress on initiatives and connectivity between services is still too little and too slow. More needs to be done, and with greater integration, if the needs and support of patients such as Kirsty Taylor are to be sufficiently and appropriately met in the future and similar deaths prevented.\n \n2. Evidence before this inquest indicated that SHFT has recognised that the mental health provision for those with personality disorders must move towards an individual, therapeutic and trauma-informed approached, which is both compassionate and recovery focused. It is evident that the ‘Personality Disorder Pathway’ currently being developed is an important step towards that, enabling practitioners and services to take a more holistic and person-centred approach, reducing risk and improving outcomes. I am aware that SHFT have been encouraged to review and further develop the Pathway. I am concerned that that must occur, and at pace.\n \n3. I remain concerned (as it is a matter I have raised on many occasions at inquest and again as a result of the experiences of the family in this case), that communication with the families of patients with mental health difficulties is still not being effectively achieved. Nor are such families being suffiently, effectively and meaningfuly listened to or understood when they voice concerns, based on their experience of the patient outside of a treatement or assessment environment. Consequently, I am concerned that such matters are not being reflected sufficiently or frequently enough in the onward treatment of those patients or in the clinical curiosity afforded to their conditions.\n \nThere remains an over-focus on patient centric assessments and patient only responses. It is recognised that patients can present quite differently to and in the presence of their families, who know them intimately, to how they may (or may be able to) present to assessing clinicians – with or without the intent to mask their condition."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 04 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Clare TAYLOR aged 33.

There was a delay in the ambulance arriving but when it did, she was conveyed to the Leicester Royal infirmary on the 29 December 2022. She was diagnosed with a fractured right ankle and shoulder injury. A boot was put on her right leg for conservative treatment of the fracture, and she was admitted. A doctor reviewed her on the 30 December 2022 and noted that she was taking warfarin to treat atrial fibrillation and decided to put her on dalteparin as they considered her International Normalized Ratio (INR) was too low. No plan was made at that time as to when to review the situation or when to stop the dalteparin. She was not seen by a Consultant Medical Physician until the 03 January 2023. He did not appreciate that she was taking warfarin and dalteparin. The INR was being measured but not considered or reviewed and by the 02 January 2023 it was above 2 which should have initiated stopping the dalteparin. However, it was not stopped at that time. Mrs Walton’s haemoglobin suddenly dropped on the 04 January 2023. On the 05 January 2023 the medical staff noticed that she was on dual anticoagulation therapy and the dalteparin was stopped and Vitamin K and blood was given. She was commenced on antibiotics for a chest infection and taken to radiology for a pelvic x-ray as it was thought that a pelvic fracture may be the source of the blood loss. It was thought that the x-ray showed a fractured pelvis, but this was later confirmed not to be the case. Further investigations were not undertaken to confirm a fracture as Mrs Walton’s condition deteriorated in the radiology department.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nDuring the Inquest evidence was heard that:\n \nSam’s mother died by an act of self-harm on the 12th April 2014. Sam was greatly affected by his mother’s death which was  known by the prison and healthcare staff at HMP Portland, however the date of her death was not identified in the prison or healthcare records and was not known to those caring for Sam.\n \nHad both prison and healthcare staff been aware of the date they would have spoken to Sam around this time to provide support to him.\n \nPrisons nationally use a records system called NOMIS and healthcare providers in prisons nationally use a records system called SystmOne. There is no mechanism in NOMIS or SystmOne to highlight key or trigger dates that may have an impact upon a prisoner.\n \nFollowing the evidence at this Inquest, local processes have been immediately put into place at HMP Portland to ensure that prisoners will be asked about any significant or trigger dates at the initial and second healthcare screen when they arrive at the prison. This information will be recorded on SystmOne manually in the risk information box and a task will be scheduled close to the key date. Prison staff do not have access to SystmOne. This is a local process and not a national one and this issue is likely to arise at all prisons in England and Wales.\n \nThere is no national guidance or policy on this and no specific question on the SystmOne records, or location in the NOMIS records, to enquire into, or highlight, significant dates for the prisoner.\n \nWhen meeting with a prisoner, prison staff have access to the NOMIS records, however, most of the prison staff who gave evidence at the Inquest stated that they would not read the full records and just look at the last 2 or 3 contacts. Due to the current reduction in staffing levels at HMP Portland as a result of difficulties in recruitment, which is affecting  staffing  within prisons nationally, staff gave evidence that they do not have the time to consider the NOMIS records in full for routine checks or welfare checks under the keyworker scheme. Evidence was also given by a Supervising Officer at the prison that when ACCT reviews are conducted this could be the first time they meet the prisoner and they do not have time to go through all the records due to current staffing pressures.\n \nThere is no ability to search the NOMIS records by a key word search as there is on SystmOne, so key information about a prisoner may be buried within the case notes section on NOMIS which can be very lengthy. To find out this  information  staff would have to go through all the records  which as stated above is not practically possible due to current staffing levels. As  a result information can be missed.\n \nAlthough there is an alerts page on NOMIS this only allows certain standard entries and there is no free text box to allow bespoke entry of information. This results in key  information about a prisoner being overlooked. Some witnesses gave evidence that they were not aware of Sam’s history contained in the NOMIS records and had they been, they would have acted differently.\n \nThere is a new version of NOMIS which although being used in the Prison Service at the moment, is still under development which could address these issues.\n \niii. In prison, prisoners  are  prescribed  medication  to  take  either under supervision or in their own possession. This means that a prisoner can self-medicate in their cell. Prescriptions of medications can be given to cover a supply for up to 28 days. Prior to a determination as to whether it would be safe for a prisoner to have medication in their possession, a  risk assessment is undertaken both around the type of medication and the prisoner’s individual risks.\n \nSam was prescribed [REDACTED] and was permitted to take this in possession for a period of 7 days. He last collected this on 26th January 2021, over 3 months before his death. Following his death, he was  found to have [REDACTED] in his blood and [REDACTED]  was found in his cell.\nIt may have been that he was illicitly obtaining [REDACTED],\nhowever it may also be that he had left over  medication  from that he had been prescribed previously.\n \nWhen a prisoner stops taking medication, healthcare teams have little option other than asking if a person has any leftover medication and are dependent on the prisoner handing any excess medication back. Healthcare teams do not have the power to search a cell although can pass information on to the prison staff if they have any concerns regarding the stockpiling  or access to medication in the cell.\n \nThere is a local operating policy in place within the healthcare department at HMP Portland to cover medication. Following the evidence heard during the Inquest, this has already been amended to ensure steps are taken to try to ensure that a prisoner does not have any medication in their cell which they should not have. There is, however, no national guidance  to assist both healthcare and Prison Service staff deal with this issue and it is for individual risons to set u their own recesses."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 11th May 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death  of Samuel Lewis Jones, born on the 24th November 1998.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, 30th January 2024.

After taking a prescription drug overdose in February 2022, she came under the care of the Community Mental Health Team. After taking a further intentional prescription drug overdose on 3 May 2022, she was provided with a period of in- patient psychiatric treatment. Although she was discharged back to the Community Mental Health Team following her discharge, she did not attend her appointment with the Community Psychiatrist on 14 July 2022. By early August 2022, although it was clear that her mental health had deteriorated and that her relationship with her Community Mental Health Team Key Worker had broken down, she was not seen by any clinically qualified staff and had limited mental health support. A crisis point was reached when she awoke in the early hours of 18 August 2022 in distress and, after packing a bag which included half a week’s medication, left her home at 04.00 hours. Police subsequently attended her home and found a note suggesting a possible intention to harm herself. She was deemed to be a high-risk missing person and, after an effective search by police, she was located at the Travelodge in Toddington; although she denied being suicidal, police made further referrals to the Mental Health Team and Social/Children Services with concerns for her welfare. Although requested by Social/Children Services to see her, the Community Health Team did not go to see her but, instead, attempted to contact her by telephone. When the Deceased called them back at around 16.09 hours, her call was answered by administrative staff and, when she could not be put through to the clinically trained Duty Officer, she terminated the call. Although the Duty Officer called her back shortly after, she did not answer and no further action was taken.

On 30 June 2021 Katherine was referred to the syringomyelia clinic (specialist clinic for patients with a syrinx). Although Katherine had back pain there was not felt to be a spinal surgical cause for this, and she was discharged from the complex spine clinic but was then referred to the pain team. Katherine had a history of progressive sensory and motor symptoms on the right side and because this could not be explained by her syrinx, an urgent MRI brain scan was requested. This scan was performed on 31 August 2021 and reported as normal. On 13 December 2021 Katherine was seen by a Consultant in Pain Medicine who noted the brain MRI of August looked abnormal and requested a review of the scan. On review there was a mass lesion that had been missed. Katherine underwent a further MRI of the brain where she was found to have tumour (left superior cerebellar / left quadrigeminal cistern region) which had increased in size by approximately 10mm since 31 August 2021. On 18 January 2022 a biopsy was undertaken to establish the type of tumour and a further scan took place on 2 February 2022 when the tumour was felt to have increased in size further. The tumour was found to be an atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (AT/RT). This being a highly malignant central nervous system neoplasm which generally affects infants and is reported to rarely occur in adults. The prognosis of this type of tumour was poor. The management plan was to remove as much of the tumour as possible and then treat it with chemotherapy and radiation. Katherine was consented for the procedure where the risk to life was deemed low. Katherine was admitted to the Walton Centre on 21 February 2022 and underwent the surgery on 22 February 2022. The surgery was uneventful, and a large portion of the tumour was removed but there was still part of the tumour that remained as it could not be removed. Post -operatively, Katherine was slow to wake, and a CT brain scan showed there was some blood at the site of surgery, and it was reviewed by the operating surgeons and no further surgery was felt to be necessary. The plan was to leave the external ventricular drain (EVD) in and continue high dose steroids to help reduce post operative swelling. Katherine was transferred to the intensive care unit to be kept sedated and ventilated overnight. As the sedation was reduced, Katherine became aware of the endotracheal tube (ETT) and bit down on it causing significant trauma to her tongue at the same time. The sedation was increased to enable Katherine to tolerate the tube again. Later that day the tongue was noted to be very swollen and was assessed as being a risk to the airway which prevented the removal of the ETT. The sedation was reduced over the ensuing 48 hours and neurological assessment showed improvement, eye opening to stimuli, obeying commands on the left side however there was still a severe weakness on the right side."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

However, this group of patients have multiple co-morbidities and complexities due to their age, which would be better managed by a medical team specialising in care of the elderly. Whilst medical teams can review patients, their limited resources mean it may not be as quickly as it needs to be, and they cannot be proactive in following up on the care of these patients.

She took up residency on discharge from hospital where she had had an inpatient stay as a result of a fall in the community.\n \nOn becoming a resident of Ashley House Barbara had a known diagnosis of dementia, which sometimes affected her memory. She was at a high risk of falling and had blurred vision. All in all, she was a relatively frail elderly woman with known risks around her mobility and she relied on others to keep her safe.\n \nBarbara was the only resident with a bedroom on the first floor of Ashley House. This could only be accessed via the stairs (which Barbara was incapable of ascending or descending safely) or the mechanically operated stairlift (which Barbara was not permitted to use unattended or unsupervised.)\n \nOn the evening of the 8th of August 2022 two carers were on duty; neither of whom were native English speaking nationals; one was Romanian and the other was Indian.\n \nI was told that in order to be able to work in the UK, those requiring a Visa (as the two carers on duty did) must prove that they can read, write, speak and understand English to at least Level B1…. [that they must demonstrate that they] can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work”. Applicants for a Visa must have passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT).\n \nIt transpired during the Inquest that one of the workers on the evening of the 8th August 2022 had never passed the SELT, so was not qualified or permitted to work in the UK.\n \nAt 19:27 one of the carers called 999 to request an ambulance. It was clear, on the evidence, that Barbara had been left unattended on the mechanical chair for around five minutes. This was clearly contrary to the rules and procedures of Ashley House. During those five minutes she has left the seat of the mechanically operated stairlift (possibly unfastening the seat belt) and proceeded to climb the stairs; which she was unable to safely, due to do physical limitations and her underlying cognitive impairment.\n \nShe has fallen on the stairs, falling downwards. There were no witnesses to this incident but Barbara has been found, having fallen awkwardly, landing with her head trapped under the chair for the mechanically operated stairlift. Care staff were unable to free her because of the positioning and angle at which she was entrapped within the mechanics.\n \nOn calling 999 (copies of both recordings were played at the Inquest) it was obvious that neither of the care staff were sufficiently proficient in English to be able to:\nExplain clearly the nature of the medical emergency. An internal audit by the ambulance service revealed that the call-handler had selected an incorrect pathway. The correct pathway that should have been selected was “entrapment” but at no time during the call did the carer give any\ninformation that would have indicated that this was the presenting problem. The carer repeated used the word “blocked” which added no assistance, clarity of explanation of the events that were unfolding.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing”. This made any meaningful triage of Barbara’s condition virtually impossible. The call handler followed the script to ask if the patient was conscious and breathing (i.e. to ascertain clinical emergency and determination of a priority response) but this assessment was severely hampered given the carer did not appear to know or understand the difference between bleeding and breathing.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “alert” and “alive”, which presented all of the same problems as referred in in (ii) above.\n \nParamedics arrived on a category 2 response and, on arrival, it was clear that Barbara was beyond medical help. She was pronounced deceased at the scene."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nI am concerned that those working with vulnerable people who are in a position of trust and responsibility must be able to demonstrate a sufficient proficiency in English to enable to summon appropriate emergency medical attention when needed. Vulnerable people, by very definition, are unable to often appreciate the need for help; take steps to keep themselves safe and/or summon help for themselves when they need it.\n \nBy being unable to speak the native language of England with any proficiency I am concerned that deaths will continue to arise where those who are young, disabled, suffering from a mental impairment or who are elderly and in need of urgent medical help will not have this summoned for them if those who are engaging with emergency professionals are unable to communicate effectively.\n \nThe Court looked at evidence of the B1 English test. Examples from the paper were as follows:\n“I                      that book last year” (options are bought, have bought, had bought)\n“The town,                  is very beautiful, has lots of parks” (options are which, where, what).\nThis level of comprehension is comparable to a KS2 curriculum being studied by Year 6 students sitting their SATS exam and appears to be wholly insufficient for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people, as demonstrated in this case by carers who were alone (i.e. no English speaking members of staff on duty) being unable to explain to medical professionals the presenting condition of the patient."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Jean Rymell, aged 91 (“Barbara”).

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nDerbyshire Constabulary:\n \nStalking – during the inquest I heard evidence from the police officers who were involved in investigating Gracie’s stalking complaint in February 2021. Derbyshire Constabulary accepted that there were serious failings in how Gracie’s complaint was investigated by these officers. I do recognise that Derbyshire Constabulary has taken some steps following Gracie’s death to improve knowledge around stalking. However, as the Detective Chief Superintendent who gave evidence for the Constabulary accepted, more needs to be done to improve knowledge and understanding around how officers should investigate complaints of stalking. Consideration may be given to:\n \nReviewing the current force guidance/training on stalking and considering whether further guidance/training is required in light of the issues identified during the inquest (including consideration of whether there ought to be a force policy on stalking);\n \nRe-enforcing understanding of the existing training/guidance on stalking including consideration of further training sessions/briefings to emphasise the key issues around investigating complaints of stalking, particularly in relation to the need to investigate the stalking complaint fully in order to identify potential patterns in the suspect’s alleged behaviour;\n \nEnsuring officers are aware of the available resources on stalking and, crucially, the importance of actually consulting the available resources on stalking when police officers are investigating stalking cases to ensure that investigations are conducted in line with expected standards.\n \nRisk assessments – during the inquest I saw a number of good quality risk assessments completed by police call handlers/officers who were involved in the very early stages of Gracie’s stalking complaint in February 2021 and also the rucksack incident in May 2021. However, it became apparent during the inquest that the police officers who were subsequently allocated to deal with the stalking complaint and the rucksack incident failed to record any form of risk assessment or fully assess the potential risks. As was recognised by the Detective Chief Superintendent who gave evidence for the Constabulary at the inquest, the crime report for the stalking investigation in February 2021 lacked any sort of risk assessment or even a recognition of potential risks. I heard evidence from the police officers involved in the stalking investigation and the rucksack incident and I am concerned that there may be an ongoing lack of understanding about the importance of completing comprehensive risk assessments which include the initial identification of risk and also, importantly, a regular re-assessment of risk as the investigation progresses. I consider that further steps should be considered in order to improve understanding and appreciation of the importance of completing comprehensive risk assessments.\n \nIndependent Office for Police Conduct (“IOPC”) – the IOPC carried out an investigation into the conduct of the five officers involved in the stalking investigation and the rucksack incident. The IOPC made a number of recommendations to Derbyshire Constabulary which included:\n \n‘2. To consider how stalking offence locations are recorded on Niche. There does not appear to be any guidance to suggest that all of the locations of the stalking offending are tagged to the incident individually. In this instance it may not have made any difference as the officers who received the bag did not do a search of police systems for the area. However, in future that may well be done, and it could make the difference between linking risk and suspects.’\n \nI heard evidence about this issue from the Detective Chief Superintendent on behalf of the Constabulary and I am concerned that more needs to be done to engage with this specific recommendation from the IOPC. The inquest heard that specific geographical locations can be particularly important in stalking investigations (i.e the horse field in Gracie’s case). As such, it seems to me that the IOPC recommendation is an important one which could assist in future cases with linking suspects and particular locations relevant to the stalking investigation.\n \nContemporaneous note taking/record keeping – during the inquest I heard that police officers failed to make any contemporaneous notes of important steps in the police investigation including, for example, conversations with an informant/member of the public, words of advice given to a suspect, a telephone call to a potential witness and also an internal police discussion between a police constable and police sergeant discussing the closure of an investigation. The written crime reports reviewed during the inquest also lacked sufficient detail around these important conversations/investigative steps – in other words, the crime reports did not compensate for the lack of contemporaneous notes.\n \nI am concerned that a lack of contemporaneous notes/insufficient detail within a crime report may impact on the ability to make properly informed risk assessments which rely on the existence of a good written record of important conversations/steps taken during an investigation. This may become an issue where, for example, an investigation is re-allocated to another police officer who has had no prior involvement in the investigation such that the newly allocated police officer will be reliant upon the quality of the original police officer’s records/notes."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 21 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gracie Elizabeth Spinks (“Gracie”) who was 23 years old when she died on 18 June 2021.

They were murdered by Terri’s partner Damien Bendall, curfewed to the address under a suspended sentence order, who had inflicted severe head injuries on all four, and he had also raped Lacey.   "",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\nProbation Service (PS) offender records and documents.\n \nThe inquests identified that very concerning information regarding Damien Bendall was made known to the PS (including violent assault and injury of a partner, and an incident of possible child sexual abuse) but was not recorded clearly or prominently for subsequent PS practitioners to read and evaluate in risk assessment and decision- making, and indeed was not read at key and critical points. Although this was in part due to the recording made by individual PS practitioners it was also the result of confusing proformas (e.g. the OASys misleading drop-down boxes and the open and closed sections), imprecise arrangements and expectations of how and where such information should be recorded, and where checks should be directed and made when the records needed to be reviewed. The inquests were informed of current PS expectations for recording offender risk information and assessments, but I remain very unsure that there are clear and efficient recording arrangements and systems to ensure that risk information is accurate, prominent, easily seen, and easily updateable by PS practitioners.\n \nPS domestic abuse (DA) and child safeguarding (SG) checks\n \nThe inquests identified that DA and SG checks were either insufficient or wholly lacking at various stages of Damien Bendall’s offender management. The current evidence is that DA and SG checks remain generally insufficient or are not being done with consequent on-going risks to children and women.\n \nInsufficient or absent PS DA and SG checks has been a theme of HM Inspectorate of Probation reports and reviews for at least the last 5 years. On HM Inspectorate of Probation case sampling to determine whether domestic abuse and child safeguarding enquiries were being undertaken when indicated, the HM Inspectorate of Probation Annual Report for 2022/2023 states at page 38: –\n \nwhere inspectors judged that these enquiries needed to be made by the probation practitioner, child safeguarding enquiries were carried out in 55 per cent of cases, domestic abuse enquiries were only carried out in 49 per cent of cases and risk of harm was only properly addressed in 39 per cent.\n \nThe PS is not currently conducting SG checks in all cases where an offender will live with or have access to children.\n \nThe PS has mandated that in all cases where a curfew condition is proposed to the court in a pre-sentence report (PSR) DA and SG checks will be conducted prior to the proposal and submission of the PSR: this is not being done in all cases. I am also unclear whether contact to the address homeowner/lead tenant for a potential curfew condition to discuss the suitability of a curfew condition is being undertaken in all cases.\n \nRelatedly, although I have not taken evidence on this wider issue, it appears to me that the systems for conducting DA and SG checks are generally severely strained. I say this because as an example the PS has now employed staff to make the checks from police records and has had to do this because the police service itself is unable to check and provide the information to the PS within necessary timeframes.\n \nPS PSR reports\n \nThere is no evidence that DA and SG checks were made by the PS practitioner in respect of Damien Bendall’s PSR report. Via the report the court was informed that checks had been conducted. The PS practitioner put forward a curfew provision as appropriate and the report was written in such a way to indicate that the report writer had checked the suitability of the curfew address, when she had not in fact done so. Had the court not been misled it is unlikely that the court’s disposal would have included a curfew requirement.\n \nThe inquests heard that PSRs written by the same PS practitioner, reviewed before her submission of Damien Bendall’s PSR, and reports reviewed after the murders, also lacked evidence of DA and SG checks having been made even though they were stated to have been done in the reports.\n \nEvidence from senior PS staff was to the effect that failing to undertake the checks and failure to make this explicitly clear in a PSR might be dealt with by management feedback to the PS practitioner but is an unlikely to be a disciplinary matter. This leads me to question whether, given the potentially very disastrous outcomes in terms of public protection, the PS is failing to grasp the seriousness of the issue, to make this explicit to PS practitioners, and ensure that there are commensurate penalties for staff where these professional duties have been breached.\n \nPS DA and SG training\n \nA significant issue in the inquests was the fact that the very inexperienced staff who were (wrongly) allocated Damien Bendall’s case on transfer to the East Midlands PS region had insufficient DA and SG training. The PS states it has introduced more robust DA and SG training, but it is unclear whether PS practitioners are receiving this before cases are allocated to them to manage.\n \nReporting concerns to the PS by the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS)\n \nDamien Bendall made the comment “if this relationship goes bad I’ll murder my girlfriend and the children” to the EMS field operative who fitted his tag and monitoring equipment but this was not reported back by the field operative to her manager nor to the PS. EMS has stated that it has introduced relevant training but the inquest heard evidence from the field operative that comments made by offenders which can be interpreted as potentially posing risk are currently routinely not being reported back by EMS field operatives.\n \nThe inquests examined the relevant contract terms between the Ministry of Justice and Capita (EMS) relating to reporting concerns and there did appear to be lack of clarity on reporting mechanisms and issues to report.\n \nNotification of missed substance misuse appointments to the PS\n \nIn Derbyshire the substance misuse services provided to offenders where there is a court-imposed sentence requirement for such services is provided under the auspices of Derbyshire Healthcare NHS FT. Damien Bendall was subject to an alcohol treatment requirement. The precise number is not clear on the records, but he missed 4 or 5 appointments with the service between 21 July and his first attended appointment on 17 September 2021, but the required proforma attendance/non-attendance forms were not sent by the substance misuse service to notify the PS."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 23 September 2021 I commenced investigations into the deaths of Terri Liz Harris aged 35, her children John-Paul Bennett and Lacey Bennett, aged 13 and 11 respectively, and their friend Connie Gent aged 11.

As a result, she was under regular surveillance during her pregnancy and had regular growth scans as her age, BMI and methadone use all placed her in the high-risk category.\n \n2. While some concerns were raised regarding care during pregnancy, labour and immediately after delivery, which were investigated by the HSIB and reviewed by an independent expert Obstetrician, none of these were causative of Charlotte’s death.\n \n3.

While speaking to a neonatal nurse, she was increasingly short of breath, she coughed up blood and was transferred to the emergency department.\n \n4. In considering the care provided to Charlotte at this stage, expert evidence in the fields of Obstetrics, Intensive Care Medicine & Anaesthesia and Cardiology.\n \n5. Based on the expert evidence it was found that from the time Charlotte arrived in the ED, she had a number of signs and symptoms which pointed towards a likely respiratory and/or cardiac pathology which included shortness of breath, coughing up blood, fast respiratory rate requiring supplemental oxygen, bilateral lung crepitations and hypertension.\n \n6. The initial medical review was reasonably comprehensive and the differential diagnosis and management plan appropriate, and appropriate blood tests and investigations were requested. The junior doctor quite appropriately included cardiomyopathy in the differential diagnosis.\n \n7. Charlotte was given Frusemide due to concerns about heart failure and pulmonary oedema. As heart failure was being considered, the high blood pressure should also have been addressed. Expert evidence was that Frusemide should have been given twice a day, so a further dose should have been given around 1900 hours.\n \n8. Charlotte had a raised NT-proBNP level and this is a test for heart failure, but can also be raised with pre-eclampsia. A chest x-ray was said to be difficult to interpret, but did have signs of significant pulmonary oedema.\n \n9.

The system is therefore reliant upon doctors of different specialities or cardiac nurses recognising the condition and the need for contact with specialist at a different Trust.

His mother had risk factors – gestational diabetes, a congenital heart condition and heightened blood pressure. At 4 minutes of age Alfie was noted as “grunting”. At 03.55 observations were documented on the NEWTT chart. Two were in the amber category – respiratory rate of 72 rpm and Oxygen saturation of 88%. The Mother was concerned and there was cyanosis around the mouth and nose. Intermittent grunting was noticed. At a review noted up at 5am, having probably occurred at around 04.30, saturation was 89.93%. On re-testing with a monitor from the resuscitate it was found to be 97%. The assessment found that there were no other signs of respiratory distress. The evidence from the Trust has included that given the maternal risk factors, once the two amber category observation at 03.55 had been documented, antibiotics should immediately have been administered to Alfie on a pre-emptive basis. In the event antibiotics were not applied, nor was close monitoring implemented. Alfie’s temperature fluctuated. At 05.15 he was 37.5 degrees. By 14.00 he was 37 degrees. The fluctuation was to some extent influenced by environmental factors. He was noted as intermittently groaning at 06.30. There were complications with feeding. He underwent a tongue-tie procedure at 10.20. At 11.30 the complications were persisting. At around 16.45 Alfie was discharged home. He became increasingly unsettled, crying consistently. This worsened such that the parents called 999. Pre-alert to the Emergency Department of University Hospital of North Durham at 00.02 on 14 June 2022 stated that Alfie was in cardiac arrest. Despite intensive treatment, and a brief return of cardiac output at 00.40, Alfie declined and died at 01.50. The medical cause of death provided following postmortem was 1)a) severe congenital pneumonia and meningitis, b) suspected acute chorioamnionitis.

The treating clinicians view, in respect of which I agreed, was that the postural hypotension and general frailty likely caused Ray’s falls noted over the previous few days.\n \nRay was admitted the following day onto the Linnett Acute Medical Unit (LAMU) and a CT scan undertaken revealed evidence of chronic subdural haematomas, indicative of previous head trauma more likely than not attributable to earlier falls, not necessarily those falls in the last few days. In keeping with the hospital’s falls policy, following his arrival on LAMU, Charge Nurse [REDACTED] who was starting the night shift, carried out a falls risk assessment amongst other assessments. Relying on information that was passed to him verbally at the  shift handover before 8 o’clock that evening, he was however only told and therefore recorded as part of that falls risk assessment that Ray had had 1 fall in the last 12 months. Whilst recognising that there was a risk of a fall the assessment did not trigger any of the higher levels of monitoring over and above 1 hourly care rounding such as ensuring that Ray was within line of sight or more importantly was within arm’s reach of a care worker.\n \nWhilst the plan was for hourly care rounding I noted that no such checks were made on Ray from 20:50 on 17th January 2023 until just after midnight on 18th January 2023, although it was not material in my view to the events that followed but was indicative as regards the working pressures faced by nursing staff on that shift.\n \nAt 00:45 on 18th  January  2023, Nurse [REDACTED] was called by another patient in the same bay as Ray and saw him stood next to his bed passing urine into a bottle. She recalls the night light was on and she could see him clearly. She observed him suddenly falling to the right not putting his hands out to break his fall and he fell hitting his head on the chair leg as he collapsed to the floor. Due to the postural hypotension Ray was being given IV fluids and this equipment was connected to his arm. I was not of the view that the equipment contributed to the fall and found as a fact that the fall more likely than not was attributable to Ray’s postural hypotension.\n \nAs a consequence of the fall, Ray was found to have suffered head trauma and in addition had fractured his right neck of femur in respect of which it was noted more likely than not it was an osteoporotic fracture. The fracture was repaired the following day on the 19th January 2023, however, Ray as a result of immobility and trauma sustained deteriorated and he began to develop swallowing issues. He also became generally more confused and ultimately, he developed an aspiration pneumonia from which sadly he died in The Great Western Hospital on the 25th January 2023.\n \nDuring  the Inquest  hearing I heard live  evidence  from  Charge  Nurse [REDACTED] who came across as a conscientious and caring Nurse. That having been said I did ask probing questions\nof Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  as regards the discrepancy between Ray’s pre-admission history and\nwhat was actually  recorded  as part of the falls risk assessment.   By way of background,  I  was\ntold that  LAMU  consisted  of a ward  with  36 beds.   Back  in January  2023  those  beds  were\noccupied by elderly patients. I was told following the arrival of a new Chief Nurse there had been improvements in relation to staffing levels and at the time of Ray’s fall Charge Nurse [REDACTED]  told\nme that there was  1 Senior Nursing Sister in charge, 5 Registered Nurses of which he was one,\n4 Health Care Assistants  and 2 enhanced Care Workers.    "",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""Falls in the hospital environment do happen and I am not saying that all can be avoided. That having been said what I have noted of late when dealing with these cases is an increase in the instances where as a result of my investigation, in relation to cases that I have been directly involved in, that I am making findings that more likely than not the falls could have been prevented and the injuries that were causative in relation to that individuals death, avoided.\n \nRay was a 96 year old gentleman who would have died had it not been for the fall at some point in the future. That may have been in a matter of weeks, months or even a few years but had it not been for the fall on the night of the 17th 18th January 2023 he would not have died as he did, in the circumstances that he did, on the 25th January 2023.\n \nDuring the course of the Inquest, I also heard evidence from Sister Jones and in addition to the challenge of getting the staffing levels commensurate to the patients needs and safeguarding patients there does appear to be an issue that causes me a concern as regards the ability to dynamically respond to a need for enhanced supervision especially entering into night shifts. Sister Jones when questioned was open and extremely candid in her answer that at those times nursing staff could not always support those additional needs in the short term because of the challenge to get additional personnel at short notice in circumstances where the nursing team were under pressure due to the complexities and demands of patient’s needs. There is in my view no flexibility and resilience within the system to dynamically adapt and respond to changing patients enhanced needs exacerbated by the fact that especially during the winter months these beds are mainly occupied by the elderly. It is easier during day shifts to respond but  there clearly appears to be an issue especially going into night shifts.\n \nThere were 2 issues here, firstly the initial falls risk assessment on LAMU which was not undertaken  taking advantage  of all available  information  which in  my  view led to an  incorrect\nassessment  of  Ray’s  supervision  needs.    His fall  was  observed  by  another  member  of the nursing staff and therefore my view was that only arm’s length supervision would have avoided the fall and that there were sufficient indicators to warrant this prior to the event occurring. The failure here in relation to the initial assessment was down to the volume of work and not in my view laziness or anything of that nature on the part of nursing staff.\n \nFlowing from the first issue a further issue relates to the resilience and the ability to respond dynamically with changing patients on the ward so as to ensure that vulnerable patients with a high degree of risk of falling, like Ray, are properly safeguarded.\n \n[REDACTED] in her evidence talked about an ongoing programme, the Enhanced Care Toolkit Framework, which I acknowledge is work in progress, in respect of which not only the family but also I am interested in hearing what steps the Trust intends to take to mitigate against a risk of further incidents occurring such as the fall that Ray had on the night of 17th/18th of January.\n \nThis report is also being sent to The Secretary of State for the Department of Health and Social Care and the reason I have sent this to The Secretary of State is to highlight the issue and my concerns. Often when Regulation 28 Reports are submitted responses often come back from Government Departments as regards the increase in the amount of money that they are injecting into that particular public service. Coroners cannot  make recommendations but as we advance in time into yet another winter period, which will undoubtedly be challenging for frontline NHS personnel, combined with an ever-increasing elderly population whose care needs both physical and mental are more complicated and demanding, it is essential that when these vulnerable people come into the care of the state, that they are effectively safeguarded. I cannot see this winter being much different from last winter and at the moment and my concern is that potentially it could be worse. Whilst the focus of this report relates to a hospital environment, the challenges created by an increasing elderly population in terms of NHS and social care response affects those in the community as well. I do not believe that there is an easy fix for these issues when resources and budgets are stretched. The problem here undoubtedly is multi factorial but any solution here is one in respect of which the Government undoubtedly has a crucial role to play,\nand I hope The Secretary of State understands why she is a recipient to this Regulation 28 Report."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 13th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raymond Lionel Eggleton and I opened an Inquest into his death on the same date.  On the 14th November 2023 I concluded Ray’s Inquest.

Although not formally diagnosed with a mental health illness, at the time of their death clinicians were considering a working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. Madeleine had a very significant history of periodic suicidal ideation and a history of self-harm, the risk of both becoming acute in early February 2022. Madeleine was known to the Child and Young Persons Mental Health Service and to the Paediatric Ward at Ipswich Hospital. All organisations concerned with Madeleine’s care had knowledge of their history of suicidal ideation.\n \nOn the 3rd February 2022 Madeleine absconded undetected from their school and carried out an act of self-harm which resulted in their hospitalisation. They were subsequently identified as needing a Tier 4 Bed admission on a paediatric mental health ward. Measures were put in place for such a bed to be sourced. At the time of Madeleine’s death a bed was neither identified nor allocated to Madeleine.\n \nDuring Madeleines admission on Bergholt Ward at Ipswich Hospital they were assessed as being a high risk of self-harm. Their mood fluctuated and on occasions Madeleine presented with no indication of either suffering from low mood or suicidal ideation.\nThroughout this period of time Madeleine’s presentation was complex and reflected the working diagnosis of mood disorder depression of a severe nature. A risk assessment on the 12th February 2022 identified the need for additional measures in managing Madeleine’s risk which included mental health observations. These measures were ceased on or around the 14th February 2022. The rationale behind why these measures were ceased is unclear.\n \nOn the 19th February 2022, during the evening Bergholt Ward shift, Madeleine appeared settled and an earlier episode of distress during the day seemed to have no further impact on them. At around 22:05 pm Madeleine made their way to the bathroom securing the door behind them. They were not observed by ward staff entering the bathroom and there was a period of up to ten minutes during which Madeleine’s precise whereabouts was unknown. At around 22:20 pm the evening shift Nurse-in-Charge on Bergholt Ward was informed that Madeleine had been in the bathroom for at least ten minutes and was concerned that this period of time was longer than expected.

Liaison and Diversion Team members visited Mr Goodwin at home and concluded that he was at risk of self- neglect. They noted his appearance, his living conditions and the fact that he was not taking prescribed medication. On any view Mr Goodwin was vulnerable: he suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia, and was thought to misuse alcohol. The Liaison and Diversion Team considered that there were safeguarding concerns in respect of Mr Goodwin and referred him to the Adult Social Care team of Cumbria Council. I understand that the team in question now forms part of Westmorland and Furness Council. Despite this referral from practitioners who had personally visited Mr Goodwin, it was rejected at triage on 5th October 2022. I am concerned that this indicates that an approach to triage is being taken which pays insufficient regard to the concerns of practitioners who had personally witnessed apparent safeguarding concerns.\n \n(2)  The witness statement on behalf of the Adult Social Care team explains that after the refusal to conduct a safeguarding enquiry, Mr Goodwin was nevertheless referred for the Social Work team to ‘engage’ with him. A social worker took steps to engage with Mr Goodwin and his family and concluded that a care assessment was appropriate. Despite\nthis the ‘Reablement Team’ referred the case for closure indicating that they did not consider that such an assessment was not required. I am concerned that this indicates further circumstances in which the needs of a vulnerable person might be overlooked. After a social worker considered that a care assessment was needed the Reablement Team appear to be able to come to an alternative view and close the case without further discussion or rationale. In another case this might lead to a vulnerable person being disregarded.\n \n(3)  Fortunately, the Closure Team noticed that the Reablement Team were seeking to close a case in which another social worker had recommended a Care Assessment. They sent the case to the ‘Short Term Allocation Tray’. This should have resulted in a referral but that did not happen. I am concerned that in a future case a referral might not be generated and a person’s needs overlooked. The witness statement prepared by the Service Manager indicated ‘we are looking at a way of ensuring that notifications requiring an action are only acknowledged once the task is complete’. This indicates that such work has not yet borne fruit and the risk still exists.\n \n(4)  Thereafter Mr Goodwin’s case was allocated and de-allocated to a social worker within the space of one day, without anything being done. It is said that there is no note or explanation for this. I am concerned that, once again, the ability of a case to be allocated and deallocated within a short period and without anything having been done may enable a case to ‘fall through the cracks’. Indeed, the referral for the care assessment was not ultimately actioned until 25th November 2022, 2 weeks after Mr Goodwin died.\n \n(5)  More generally, it is striking how many different teams and systems appear to co-exist and require mutual communication and cross referencing. I am concerned that the above narrative demonstrates that those systems do not function effectively. I am concerned that this exposes other vulnerable adults to risk."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On    16    November    2022 I    commenced    an    investigation    into    the    death      of Gerald GOODWIN.

On 15 September, Mr Di Blasi was referred by a GP to the Lower Gastro-intestinal team for possible bowel cancer and had a CT scan on 4 November 2022. The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the\nreport until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022. The incidental findings were not considered to be ‘significant’ by the Radiologists and were not therefore warrant an alert being sent to the referring clinician, leaving the report to be reviewed when they were able to.

The Endoscopist was unaware of these incidental findings. A biopsy was taken from an area which looked abnormal but was actually a gastric varix.

The lack of communication between these teams meant that timely sharing of results did not occur. Even the very knowledge of the fact that a CT scan had taken place would have alerted the endoscopist to check those results, and it is likely that the second endoscopy would not have gone ahead. I understand this to be a national issue and is likely to apply to other investigations being carried out.\n \n(2)  That the reporting timeframes on the 2-week urgent cancer pathway referral does not take into account timeframes for reporting investigative procedures or subsequent review by the referring clinicians.\n \n(3)  The current training for Endoscopists for JAG certification requires the performance\nof 200 endoscopies. However, these tend to focus on the clinician’s area of specialty and therefore there is a danger that lesion recognition will be limited and insufficient to ensure that endoscopists are able to recognise less frequently occurring lesions.

He underwent an emergency laparotomy the same day with findings of a pelvic abscess from a perforated gangrenous appendix and non-viable adjacent colonic tissue and small bowel obstruction. This required drainage of the abscess, removal of the gangrenous tissue and bowel and formulation of a stoma. As part of the pre-surgical preparations for post operative care the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) was undertaken using the right subclavian vein. A landmark approach was used. There was no use of ultrasound to assist placement of the CVC despite this being available. As part of the checks to ensure correct placement of the CVC a check chest x-ray was undertaken. Other checks in the form of an arterial blood gas and transducing the intra-vessel pressure wave via the CVC were not undertaken even though the necessary equipment to do so was available. The check chest x-ray was incorrectly interpreted as showing correct placement into the vein whereas, in fact, the CVC had been incorrectly placed into the artery.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nMatter One\nThis is the second inquest I have heard where the delayed discharge/repatriation of an\nOut-of-Area patient from an independent provider’s hospital has been a contributory factor in that patient’s death. Lauren was 20 years of age. The other inquest involved a 15 years old patient – 115 miles from home.\n \nBoth of these cases illustrate,\na)       Underfunding for local mental health beds.\nb)       An over-reliance by the NHS on independent providers for mental health beds.\n \nThe Government set itself a target to eliminate inappropriate (which I infer would include delayed discharge) Out-of-Area in-patient placements in mental health services for adults by 2020-21.\n \nMatter Two\nThe jury identified inadequate and insufficient communication between Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust, The Priory and relevant parties.\n \nI heard evidence that Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust have appointed a designated Care Co-ordinator for its Out-of-Area patients. Having a single point of contact will alleviate some of the communication issues identified.\n \nI heard evidence from The Priory as to some of the challenges it faces when dealing with the NHS commissioning bodies, be they Hospital Trusts or Integrated Care Boards. The Priory is just one of the several independent providers of mental health care.\n1.        The Priory deals with 42 NHS separate commissioning bodies.\n2.        There are multiple software programmes for record keeping for these organisations, which makes transfer and sharing of clinical information cumbersome and difficult, as direct sharing is not possible.\n3.        These bodies have varying processes and requests for communication.\n4.        There is no national standard process for referrals into the independent sector nor for discharge/repatriation to the ‘home team’.\n \nWith regard to delayed discharge/repatriation of an Out-of-Area patient I heard evidence that The Priory have devised a protocol/standing operating procedure in respect of delayed discharge, which should reduce the risks of a patient being left miles from home at all and in any event reduce the time taken to repatriate. However, it relies on the ‘home team’s’ engagement in the process. In brief, the protocol is as follows,\n1.        Once it has been determined that a patient is ready for discharge/step- down/repatriation BUT no bed/placement is available that is a delayed discharge and the protocol is triggered.\n2.        In week one The Priory MDT hold a professionals meeting to explore reasons for delay and together with the ‘home team’ identify SMART actions.\n3.        If after 4 weeks there is limited progress The Priory MDT will request the ‘home team’ ICB to arrange a Care & Treatment Review.\n4.        If there is, by then, no or little progress there should be discussions between the Priory Head of NHS Partnerships and the ‘home team’ Commissioning Managers.\n5.        As a last resort: service of notice on the patient’s placement.\n \nThe protocol is heavily reliant on engagement from, and cooperation of, the numerous NHS commissioning bodies. The protocol requires a low threshold for the escalation of delays to the appropriate manager and/or commissioner at the ‘home service’.\n \nThere are over 60 independent providers for in-patient mental health services.\n \nThe initiative taken by The Priory is to be applauded but it is just one of many independent providers for some 42 separate NHS commissioning bodies. There is a clear danger that it will not be adopted by the other independent providers, indeed there is no reason for them to be aware of its existence. In  the premises, Out-of-Area  delayed discharge, and its detrimental effect on a patient’s mental health, will remain a matter of concern.\n \nWhile there remains a shortage of local NHS mental beds and the Government remains committed to eliminating inappropriate Out-of-Area in-patient placements the development of protocols or standardised operating procedures to avoid delayed discharge, or limit the length of delay, is a clearly a matter for the NHS rather than the individual independent providers."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 01.03.22 an investigation commenced into the death of Lauren Elizabeth Bridges who died on 26.02.22, aged 20 years.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

He was transported to Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth (QAH) and assessed in the emergency department (ED). He was moved to the observation ward and seen by a consultant who requested further assessment to determine whether Jack needed to be detained under the Mental Health Act. Before this happened, Jack absconded from the observation ward via the fire door at approximately 9.00am.\n \nJack was located by the police and returned to the ward where he was detained under s.5(2) of the Mental Health Act. He was subsequently detained under s.2 of the Mental Health Act.\n \nOn the 31st December 2019 Jack absconded via the same route despite being under 1:1 supervision by a registered mental health nurse. Jack was located and returned to the ward by the police.\n \nIn the early evening of the same day Jack was transferred to St James’ Hospital and admitted to the Hawthorn ward.\n \nOn the 1st January 2020 Jack threw himself at a glass dividing wall.\n \nOn the 2nd January 2020 Jack suffered a medical episode and was transferred by ambulance to the emergency department of QAH.

He had been under the care of the Midlands Partnership NHS Foundation Trust for many years in relation to his mental health difficulties and they held significant records. He was assessed as stable in 2019 when he moved to Hampshire and was discharged from their service. When Jack became unwell again neither the community mental health team nor the in-patient mental health team of Solent NHS Trust were able to access Jack’s records from the Midlands and a copy had to be requested. For a number of reasons this was not available prior to Jack’s death and this may have impacted the decision making ability of the staff caring for Jack.\nI heard evidence that there is no systems or arrangements for the sharing of access to electronic medical records (such as SystmOne and RIO) outside of local areas and the Care and Health Information Exchange (CHIE) operating in the local area contains limited information.\n \nI also received evidence that the new NHS England National Record Locator system only acts as a flag to show who holds records rather than allowing access to clinicians.\n \nThis fragmentation of patient records means that medical and mental health practitioners do not have quick access to relevant information about their patients. In Jack’s case he was detained under the Mental Health Act on New Years Eve and at the start of a bank holiday weekend. As such the staff of the mental health unit did not have any way to obtain his records during the out of hours period.\n \nSolent NHS Trust\nI am pleased to hear that since Jack’s death and the subsequent inquest Solent NHS Trust have updated their training and guidance to staff members who are escorting detained patients. Additionally they are introducing an alert system within SystmOne for patients at increased risk of absconding and/or self-harm.\n \nThere remain 2 areas of concern:\n \n1. Handovers\nI heard evidence that the staff within the secure mental health unit rely very heavily on information given at handovers at the start of a shift and they do not have time to review the patient records in detail. At the time of Jack’s death records of these handovers were not stored in the same way as other patient records and, in Jack’s case, were missing entirely. This significantly hampered the investigation and inquest.\n \nI am pleased to hear that Solent NHS Trust have now changed their document storage policy in this regard and these records will now be added to and stored on SystmOne.\n \nHowever the handover records are not currently completed within SystmOne. This gives rise to the continuing risk of this information not being correctly recorded or correctly stored.

The call was allocated a C2 category which aims to have an urgent response within an 18 minute time frame. The EEAS was extremely busy that night with previously unseen levels of C2 allocations of ambulances. In addition, the hospitals in the area were queuing ambulances outside ED’s because they were unable to offload patients and then proceed to other calls. That combination meant that despite being allocated an urgent response time Mr Vincent was effectively left on the floor for a very prolonged time. Ultimately he had a cardiac arrest at home and an ambulance attended promptly. He was resuscitated but the “down time” was prolonged.

The overwhelming thrust of the evidence presented indicated a poor attitude to a joined-up and cohesive response from the management and clinical teams and this resulted in a lack of clinical leadership, judgment and action being taken.\n \nMrs White lacked capacity due to her cognitive impairment and so was unable to appreciate the risks that immobility posed to her.

Mr Gale was diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety. Mr Gale was seen regularly by mental health professionals and was in frequent contact with mental health services. Those services were provided by Cumbria, Northumberland Tyne & Wear NHS Foundation Trust (“the Trust”). Mr Gale was compliant with his medication and engaged with services. He was well supported by his family and friends.\n \nMr Gale’s anxiety continued during his engagement with mental health services. Evidence was heard about what caused Mr Gale’s anxiety. One ongoing feature was his application for Universal Credit.\n \nOn 2 March 2023, 2 days before his death, Mr Gale was seen by an Associate Specialist Psychiatrist, who gave evidence at the inquest. The Psychiatrist considered Mr Gale’s anxiety was exacerbated by his application for Universal Credit. During Mr Gale’s appointment, the Psychiatrist called the benefits office for help but the call was not answered before the end of the consultation. Mr Gale was expecting a call from a DWP representative the next day (3 March).\n \nOn 3 March 2022 at approximately 11:00 am, Mr Gale spoke to the duty Registered Mental Health Nurse. He remained very anxious and his main concern was the application for Universal Credit.\n \nDuring their evidence, the Associate Specialist Psychiatrist expressed concerns about the experience of mental health service users with DWP. These concerns were not just specific to Mr Gale.\n \nEvidence was also given by the Trust’s Group Nurse Director (a Registered Mental Health Nurse) who considered that the issues identified by the Psychiatrist were national. The Director considered it important to address these issues as they were debilitating for service users.\n \nThe Director advised that the Trust’s Crisis Team had started a food bank 3 years ago to support service users. The Director was also aware that the DWP had been invited to the Cumbria Suicide Prevention Group.\n \nI stress that I did not make a causal link between Mr Gale’s death and his anxiety about his Universal Credit application.

She had suffered a stroke in 2016 and her condition had progressively worsened due to dementia. Mrs Burcham was incapable of doing anything for herself and she relied on the staff at the Nursing Home to anticipate and meet her every need and provide her with full care, including; personal care, hoisting, transfer, nutrition etc. She also lacked capacity and could only communicate through incoherent mumbling and facial expressions, which the staff who knew her well at the home had learned to interpret.\n \nThe Home is a residential and nursing home which, whilst accepting patients with dementia, is not a dementia specialist service.\n \nOn the 14th of December 2022 the Home had organised a carol concert in the communal lounge as part of their Christmas celebrations. It was attended by residents and their families, staff and church volunteers.\n \nMrs Burcham was brought to the lounge and hoisted into a standard riser- recliner chair. As she lacked any ability to support her own posture she was wedged in with pillows and the chair legs elevated by staff (via the remote control) to prevent her from slipping out. Carers then went to assist other residents to access the lounge ahead of the concert starting.\n \nThe riser recliner chair that Mrs Burcham was in appeared to be a fairly standard design; an electric chair plugged in at the mains to enable the mechanism via a remote control, which is attached to the chair via a cord, with a side pocket for storage of the remote control whilst it is not in use.\n \nWhilst Mrs Burcham was in the riser-recliner chair unattended, another resident of the Home has accessed the remote control for the chair. This other resident had dementia which manifested itself in a compulsion to randomly fiddle. The other resident fiddled with the remote control buttons as they were accessible, unlocked and unsupervised and, without any intention or malice (or indeed any appreciation whatsoever of what she had done, because of her own cognitive impairment) managed to elevate the chair to its full rise position and tip Mrs Burcham onto the floor.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \nThe accounts detailing Christopher’s decline over the course of a week; from a young, fit, engaging and polite gentleman, to a man who could not speak, eat, or properly stand, were harrowing for all to hear, not least his family. These accounts were supported by CCTV footage demonstrating Christopher’s extreme vulnerability on account of his acute ill health.\n \nI remain unable to comprehend how, in the face of Christopher’s clear need for urgent medical assistance, this was not facilitated for him by those charged with the responsibility for his care, at a time when Christopher was unable through illness to ask for help. This was a clear case of the most serious neglect contributing to Christopher’ tragic death.\n \n1.       An inability to provide prisoners at HMP Lowdham Grange with safe clinical care\n \nI heard evidence, and the jury reached findings, that there was an unsafe practice of staff conducting important healthcare and wellbeing observations via the cell door observation hatch. Observing an unwell prisoner through a hatch slightly larger than a letterbox undermines the safety of the clinical assessment.\n \nHealthcare staff did not utilise the NEWS2 system of monitoring the condition of an acutely unwell prisoner, despite the Trust having adopted this recognised healthcare tool many years prior. The Forensic Directorate has continued to lag behind other areas of the Trust where NEWS2 is fully embedded and this has previously been identified as an issue linked to other deaths.\n \nThere was a lack of robust GP visits, despite such being mandated by the Prison Rules. When visits did take place, they were often via the cell door observation hatch and conducted as “fleeting glances” rather than robust clinical assessments. Again, this is unsafe.\n \nThere was a lack of effective leadership of the healthcare department to ensure that staff had created a safe plan of care for Christopher. Senior personnel were not aware of Christopher’s week-long deterioration in the segregation unit until very late in the chronology of events, nor were they aware of a dispute between the mental health and physical health teams as to the differential diagnoses that might be causing his concerning symptoms and deterioration. Despite daily lunch time meetings, there was a stark lack of professional curiosity from senior staff as to the plan of care for Christopher and what safety netting, if any, was in place.\n \n2. An inability to record, retain and supply HM Coroner with material relevant to the inquest\n \nThe progress of this inquest, taking places years after Christopher’s death, was halted many times due to the late disclosure of material relevant to the inquest. Policies and procedures said to exist at the time were produced mid-hearing.\n \nDespite the Trust having conducted their own review of the case, being provided with ample notice of the inquest hearing, and having attended multiple pre-inquest review hearings, there was an inability to identify key material and to supply that to the court in good time.\n \nThe ability to reflect on the care provided in advance of a prisoner’s death is dependant on the Trust’s ability to isolate the relevant evidence, and to analyse it. Without the appropriate professional curiosity to understand exactly what happened, the Trust will repeatedly miss opportunities to learn from deaths and to take action to seek to prevent future deaths."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 06 June 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Howard SMITH.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \nThe focus of my concerns relates to the approach of your Trust to learning from deaths. Although Mr Barnes was not treated at the John Radcliffe Hospital, I concluded that he should have been transferred there, and that the delay in carrying out vascular surgery there contributed to his death. The Oxford Trust has been involved in this investigation almost from the start, and other Interested Persons involved in the investigation have attempted to work with your Trust to investigate the circumstances of Mr Barnes’ death.\n \nI have been assisted by investigation reports and statements from the Spire Dunedin Hospital, and Royal Berkshire Hospital. This, I am afraid, sits in stark contrast to the response and approach by the Oxford Trust.\n \nThe Oxford Trust has carried out no investigation. They did not co-operate with the offer to conduct a joint investigation with Royal Berkshire Hospital.\n \nThere is no recorded morbidity and mortality meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.\n \nThere is no recorded MDT meeting minute, although we were told at inquest that the case was discussed.\n \nThere is no evidence of proposed changes beyond evidence in court during the inquest that “we are looking into this”. Whilst I accept entirely that a knee-jerk response, even following a tragic death, is not appropriate, it is now some 18 months since Mr Barnes’ death.\n \nEvidence from RBH and Spire Dunedin was consistent, namely that attempts to liaise with your trust and learn from this event jointly have been universally ignored.\n \nIt was also difficult for my office to obtain evidence for the inquest. We were provided with a joint statement, from three consultant vascular surgeons (only two of whom were clinically involved). It transpired that this statement was written by a clinical governance manager, and each of the witnesses who gave evidence was careful to tell the court that they did not agree with the wording of that statement. We subsequently received a statement from the consultant vascular surgeon in this case on the 29th of September, and from the clinical lead of vascular surgery some 5 days before the inquest started. We were also informed 11 days before the inquest started that the key vascular surgery witness would be on holiday abroad. This witness was summonsed in May 2023. He ultimately gave evidence by video link, but this was difficult technically, and arrangements would have been made for him to attend in person, had we been made aware of this holiday arrangement, even aside from the fact that he had been formally summonsed."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""I have on occasion referred to the deceased as Barney.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Miss Ferkova’s death were as set out in the attached Prevention of Future Death Reports which I addressed to NHS England and the Care Quality Commission (CQC).\n \nI did not write to Virgin Care at that time, as they were to undertake a review as to whether ‘initial’ clinical observations should be introduced by their service. This review concluded that ‘…there is not evidence to support such an intervention currently…’\n \nI was provided with responses from NHS England and the CQC (also attached) which demonstrated an intention to introduce new standards for facilities, such as the Coventry Walk-in Centre (which will be called Urgent Treatment Centres (UTC)). One such standard will include clinical assessment within 15 minutes of attending a UTC.\n \nNHS England set out that all UTCs will be expected to have a plan in place by March 2019 and will be operational by 2019. The CQC set out a change to their inspection framework which would include a recommendation for patients to receive a clinical assessment within 15 minutes. This was stated to ‘go live’ from 1 April 2018.\n \nHowever, in response to this issue Virgin Care, through its representative, set out as follows:\n \n“The onus is for the commissioners (the relevant CCG) , rather than the providers (eg Virgin Care), to take (sic) ensure that the appropriate service is being commissioned. We understand that the local commissioners are reviewing the provision of urgent care services in the community. We trust that such a review will include the revised NHS\nEngland guidance.”\n \n1.  I am concerned that this standard is being introduced to address clinical risks but Virgin Care do not intend to change their service to address this risk but are instead awaiting a change in their commissioning arrangements. I am concerned that future deaths could arise in this circumstance.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Mrs Daniel’s death are related to the initial assessment/registration/non-clinical ‘triage’ process operated by Virgin Care.\n \n2.  I am concerned that some information provided by Mrs Daniel’s family was not\ntranscribed by the reception team, meaning that it was not available in written form to the clinical team as part of the initial ‘paper’ triage process and at the later formal consultation.\n \n3.  Related to this, I am also concerned that an important part of the medical records (the handwritten form completed by patients/families on registration) is destroyed, rather than added to the notes. The fact that information provided directly by patients/families is not available to clinicians is one issue that arises, another is that review of incidents, such as Mrs Daniel’s death is hampered where ‘primary evidence’ is unavailable.\n \n4.  My final specific concern relates to the process whereby patients/families are asked to let the reception team know if the patient is deteriorating, or if they are concerned that earlier prompt review is required. I heard evidence that such concerns were raised but no action was taken. This seemingly runs counter to Virgin Care’s own ‘flagging’ system.\n \nMy overarching concern is that the current process of initial\nassessment/registration/non-clinical ‘triage’ and yellow/red flags is unsafe.

I understand that concerns were raised with the General Dental Council (GDC) in relation to his dental work and fitness to practise as a dentist, and that such concerns were being investigated.\n \nHis case was referred to the Interim Orders Committee by the Registrar of the GDC on 4 August 2022. This led to a initial hearing taking place on 13th September 2022. The IOC decision was that interim conditions be placed on Mr Lall’s ability to practise for a period of 18 months, and a 7 page report being published on the GDC website. Within that report the complaints/concerns regarding Mr Lall’s working practices were set out in detail.\n \nThere was evidence provided by the Family that Mr Lall’s mental health, affected by the GDC investigation in the first instance, then deteriorated after the detail of the complaints/concerns of his work practices entered the public domain via the GDC Website.\n \nIn November 2022 Mr Lall was formally dismissed from his employment. In December 2022 he approached his GP reporting anxiety and depression with fleeting thoughts of suicide since the loss of his job and the fitness to practice enquiries.\n \nOn Friday 12th May and again on Monday 15th May 2023, Mr Lall received email notifications from his legal team regarding an upcoming meeting with the said team and the GDC scheduled for 18th May 2023.

In this case the report ran to 7 pages and set out in detail the allegations made under the ‘background section’ and then further detail of the allegations by way of documenting the submissions made by the Counsel acting on behalf of the GDC.\n \nWhilst I accept that the report states in its preamble that “It is not the role of the IOC to make findings of fact in relation to any charge” the report detailed significant allegations, (which Mr Lall contested) which were undetermined by the GDC at that time. The report was then made available to the public via the GDC website.\n \nGiven that this was an interim order only, my concern is whether the the level of detail provided to the public at that stage of proceedings, was necessary or required. The family gave evidence at the inquest of Mr Lall that he was “an extremely private individual so the impact this had on his mental health was tremendous.” By putting detailed allegations into the public domain via the GDC website, at a stage before any final determination has taken place, I am concerned that others going through a similar process may also suffer a detrimental effect to their mental health.

Two further attempts were made at different trajectories to locate the temporal horn with the last utilising a neuro-navigation system to assist. Both were excessively deep. On being woken from the anaesthetic it was immediately apparent that Tracy had sustained serious brain injury. She died in hospital on the 19th of November 2016. On the balance of probability, it is likely that Tracy would have died as a result of the damage caused by the first incision.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 19th of December 2023.

She underwent blood tests via her GP in October 2021 and in an appointment on 11 October discussed her abnormal liver function test. On 25 October 2021 she underwent ultra sound of the abdomen which showed large gallstones. She was advised she needed a procedure. On 28 October 2022 a referral was sent by her GP to gastroenterology department, marked as routine. On 2 November 2021 the gastroneterologist referred Mrs Campbell directly for ERCP procedure and dictated a letter to her to explain this. A paper referral was completed as per procedure and sent to the endoscopy dept on 03 November 2021. There is no record of the referral form being received by endoscopy and it is not clear why it was not received or what had occurred to it. Jennifer Lydia Campbell received a copy of the letter from the Gastroenterology department dated 3 November 2021 confirming that ECRP was needed, and she had been put on the waiting list. On 21 February 2022 Mrs Campbell started to become unwell, she was in pain and suffering. On 23 February 2022 she attended the Emergency Department due to vomiting for 2 days and not being able to get out of bed.

Nevertheless skin biopsy – something every consultant dermatologist can do – was deemed necessary but the attendant dermatologist, who could have done this, did not becaue the company’s process is to ask a plastic surgeon to biopsy. It took until the 8th for the biopsy to be taken. There was no dermatological oversight of Mr Carr’s skin in the intervening\ntime. The biopsy found evidence of drug reaction consistent with SJS. An optimum dermatology service was described by our expert as patients being seen by a consultant dermatologist and biopsied if required within 24 hours of presentation, and then watched like a hawk on a daily basis.

She was taken to Tameside General Hospital where there was a prolonged wait to be seen. A CT scan undertaken showed evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage that had occurred previously around 28th March 2023. The scan was incorrectly reported as being clear. At Tameside General Hospital her consciousness levels were reduced, and she was agitated. She had probably developed a severe vasospasm from the subarachnoid haemorrhage. Treatment options at this point are extremely limited. An MRI scan on 5th April 2023 showed multi territorial infarctions and significant narrowing of all the intracranial vessels.

Ms Twinn had a congenital heart defect which resulted in a further condition, Eisenmenger syndrome which adversely affected her respiratory output. Ms Twinn was also assessed to be affected by a severe learning disability.\n \nOn 15th December Ms Twinn became unwell with symptoms of; a productive cough with yellow sputum, sickness and diarrhoea. Her family took Ms Twinn to the emergency department of Newham General Hospital.\n \nAn initial rapid assessment identified low oxygen saturations at 61% she was treated with oxygen.\n \nClinical observations were taken and the patient was monitored, blood tests could not be taken as Ms Twinn had a significant phobia of needles. Her learning disability meant that she could not be persuaded to voluntarily provide a blood sample. Similarly, any assessment of potential confusion was made more difficult due to her non-verbal status.\n \nIt was decided that a blood sample or 1/V therapy could only be administered if the patient was sedated. Ms Twinn’s complex lung and heart problems meant sedation would carry high risk and was therefore discounted.\n \nMs Twinn had continuous monitoring of oxygen levels, blood pressure and heart rate. A chest x-ray was undertaken that was interpreted by the emergency team as inconclusive of infection despite that, based on history, chest auscultation and a raised temperature, a working diagnosis of bilateral pneumonia was arrived at.\n \nA senior doctor took over care of the patient. Oxygen requirement was titrated down from high flow oxygen mask to low flow nasal cannula. Achieving saturations 75% at rest without oxygen, this was patients baseline level from medical notes.\n \nMs Twinn was discharged late in the evening on oral antibiotics, she was found deceased the following morning when her family tried to rouse her from sleep.\n \nThe Trust now accepts that the more appropriate course would have been to admit Ms Twinn for observation, monitoring of oxygen levels and providing remedial oxygen therapy if a de-saturation occurred.\n \nThe inquest took expert evidence into account in determining that an admission into hospital would not have, on the balance of probability, resulted in Ms Twinn’s death being avoided."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \n(1)  The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner’s service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased’s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be’ likely end of July/August time’. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the ‘end of September/beginning of October’ and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased’s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author’s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due ‘end of September/beginning of October’. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.\n \n(2)  The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.\n \n(3)  If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah’s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.\n \n(4)  I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths.\n \n(5)  I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust’s response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report."",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6th of December 2023.

A support worker assisted her with tasks such as ordering prescriptions, booking taxis, medical appointments, for example.\n·      Although Kiran was said to have maintained a chronic low weight for some time, evidence before the inquest suggested that in the weeks prior to her death she lost significant weight, and could take steps to avoid accurate recording of her weight, such as on two occasions when she refused to remove her boots prior to being weighed. Her BMI was 14, and would reduce further. She was said to have been “presenting as not eating, and with an increased level of confusion” and no longer willing to have prescribed ensure drinks, something she had previously agreed to.\n \n·      The quality of assistance she received from professionals varied. A support worker was proactive in seeking to provide Kiran with the help she needed, By contrast, during an inadequate mental health assessment the extent of her eating disorder and a declining weight was not considered to the degree clearly required.\n \n·      This inquest was held some time after Kiran’s death, the inquest having been necessarily adjourned on previous occasions for a range of reasons.\n \n·      The court heard how, at the time Kiran died, in terms of managing and treating an eating disorder the relevant guidance was what is often referred to as the MARSIPAN guidance. Some time later, from around May 2022, the Royal   College of Psychiatrists replaced that guidance with their up-dated Guidance on Recognising and Managing Medical Emergencies in Eating Disorders, sometimes known as the MEED guidance.\n \n·      The court received evidence from a witness who  at the time of Kiran’s death  had been Deputy Head of Adult Social Care and in her witness statement, she explained how it was part of her role to provide some level of oversight, and to identify any gap in services and address these. However, no significant internal investigation into Kiran’s death had taken place since, and no changes have  been made in response to her death.\n \n·      She confirmed that at the time of Kiran’s death, Adult Social Care staff had not received training on how to recognise indicators of concern in relation to eating disorders.\n \n·      A support worker explained how what knowledge he had about eating disorders he had accumulated from his experience of dealing with service users allocated  to him previously.\n \n·      Two approved mental health practitioners [AHMPs] employed by Blackpool Council confirmed this also applied to AMHPs, with training on eating disorders limited to whether they happened to choose an eating disorder module as part of their annual refresher training.\n \n·      There had been little if any awareness of the MARSIPAN guidance therefore around the time of Kiran’s death."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

An eating disorder is a mental disorder and with a known high risk of mortality.\n \nMany vulnerable people live in the community with support from adult social care, but who may not have access to specialist eating disorder services, perhaps due to a lack of availability or because they are reluctant to engage with specialist services.\n \nAs part of their illness, they may be reluctant to discuss their condition with family members, friends, or attend their GP surgery for monitoring of their weight.\n \nIt is important that adult social care staff, should they become aware of concerning signs of a previously unknown eating disorder problem, or identify a possible deterioration in the condition of a service user previously diagnosed with an eating disorder, take action within their range of powers to raise such concerns with the appropriate professionals, and possibly family members.\n \nI have a concern that in the absence of the tools, training and access to the relevant guidance, well – meaning adult social care staff may not recognise when a situation arises and the service user will go without necessary and often very urgent, medical assessment and treatment, and with fatal consequences.\n \nI do not seek to be prescriptive about what should now happen, and that is not the purpose of this report.

He had made multiple previous suicide attempts, including a very serious previous suicide attempt of hanging.  He had previously been arrested in December 2020 and assessed by Liaison & Diversion services whilst in Police custody. After he was remanded in custody, he was placed on an ACCT twice in prison. After his release from prison on 14th February 2021, he was referred to the community Mental Health Crisis service by his GP and also had another very recent suicide attempt in the form of an overdose of anti- depressants about a week before he was again arrested on 17th March 2021. In Police custody, he was seen by a Custodial Nurse Practitioner (CNP) who had very limited training in Mental Health and the recognition of the risk of suicide. The CNP was working alone and not alongside a doctor. The CNP assessed Jack’s risk as low. The CNP also did not refer him to Liaison & Diversion services, which the jury found that probably contributed to Jack’s death. A Forensic Medical Examiner in Police custody subsequently\nassessed Jack’s risk as high. Jack was again remanded in custody. Despite Jack’s significant risk history as well as other significant risk factors, such as being young, withdrawing from alcohol and early days in custody, no ACCT was opened by prison or healthcare staff, who were overly reassured by Jack’s presentation.  An agency healthcare member of staff had no training in the ACCT process. The jury found that the failure to open an ACCT by prison and healthcare staff probably contributed to Jack’s death and that, on the balance of probability, the risk of suicide was not adequately identified for Jack. These findings by the jury were based on the over-emphasis by prison and healthcare staff on Jack’s presentation against clear and evidenced previous suicide and self-harm risks and attempts, which were available to relevant police, prison and healthcare staff. The Court heard evidence that 65% of primary care healthcare staff in prison are agency staff. The Home Office circular from 2003 relating to the use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners refers working alongside doctors and being specifically trained for their role. However, the Circular makes no mention of assessing the risk of suicide or self-harm in its Annex which lists competencies."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. \n1.       The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future. The 2003 Home Office circular also does not recognise the risk of suicide and self-harm as being a core competency.\n \n2.       The training of agency staff in the ACCT process and recognising the appropriate threshold to open an ACCT. The training of agency staff in ACCT does not appear to be part of the commissioning process by NHS England and individual providers do not appear to provide training to agency staff in the ACCT process.

He applied for indefinite leave to remain in 2004 but this was rejected in the same year.\n2.        He had a history of severe mental health issues.\n3.        Mr Santos was remanded to HMP Highdown on 29 October 2019, being transferred to HMP Belmarsh on 26 November 2019. On 6 May 2020, Mr Santos was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and was due to be released on 27 October 2020.\n4.        On 5 October 2020, the Immigration Service served an IS91 notice of a decision to detain on Mr Santos. This meant he would not be released from prison at the end of his sentence whilst his deportation was considered. A Stage 1 letter had been served on 28 December 2018 but a Stage 2 letter had not been served. There was also an outstanding appeal in the First-tier immigration Tribunal.\n5.        Mr Santos wrote a letter on a bail form outlining his concerns about returning to Brazil, referring to his sexuality and his health. This was sent by the prison to a charity assisting immigration detainees on 29 October 2020.\n6.        In the early hours of 2 November 2020, the night officer found Mr Santos hanging in his cell during a routine check. Staff tried to resuscitate him. Ambulance staff arrived. Mr Santos was declared dead at 3.30am.\n \nIn summary, the jury found as follows:\n \n·       That Mr Santos’ understanding of his immigration position at the conclusion of his custodial sentence made a material contribution to his death.\n·       There was a failure to notify Mr Santos of the incoming IS91 form and its significance.\n·       The central issue was communication between Mr Santos and the various agencies involved with him. By 16 October 2020 Mr Santos understood he would be detained at the end of his sentence but was confident his bail application would lead to resolution. However in the days prior to his death he told a fellow prisoner he believed he was to be placed in immigration detention and deported within days.\n·       Confusion amongst the agencies involved in communicating with Mr Santos is likely to have played a vital role in his change of understanding but it was difficult to pinpoint the role that information passed to Mr Santos played in changing his understanding of his position. There were no adequate notes of a meeting on 22 October 2020 with Mr Santos and his prison and community offender managers. However it was clear that his view of his circumstances changed and he decided to end his life and deliberately did not clearly communicate his intent to those around him."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.\n \nI have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest. Published responses to the report suggest some concerns are being addressed, albeit it is not clear if they have been resolved.\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n1.      Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as “causative matters” in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases.\nTiming of IS91 notification.\n \n2.      The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage.\nSignposting legal advice about immigration matters\n \n3.      Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.\n4.      I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.\n5.      In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.\nCommunication between agencies\n \n6.      Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.\n7.      I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.\n \nDelays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.\n \n8.      I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos’ case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos’ case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.\n9.      I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.\nThe SSHD Internal report\n \n10.    The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos’ case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.\n11.    The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos’ case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.\n12.    This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""1.      The death of Manoel Messias Santos (“Mr Santos”) was reported to the coroner by HMP Belmarsh on the date of his death, 2 November 2020.                                                                                      .\n2.      A forensic post-mortem was conducted on 5 November 2020.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  \n1.       The evidence given on behalf of the Birmingham & Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust was that in addition to this present case, where the deceased’s risk assessment was not updated between November 2021 and her death in March 2023 despite circumstances which I was told ought to have triggered an update, there were a further number of cases within the Trust in which Root Cause Analysis reports had been produced, where it had also been found that risk assessments were not being completed in line with expectations; further, that it was not clear why this was happening.\n \n2.       If risk assessments are not being properly completed or updated, then there is an obvious risk of deaths occurring in the future, as a result of insufficient recording of risk. The fact that risk-relevant information may be recorded in the body of clinical notes is not reassuring, because a risk assessment or risk summary ought to capture the most salient risk information so that a professional looking quickly can absorb it; this is all the more important where professionals are under time pressure.\n \n3.       The evidence given to me was that a ‘task and finish group’ has been set up to address the issue, which expects to have concluded by early next year, i.e. 2024, and that this group will be addressing matters as they are found rather than waiting until the final stage of its existence early next year. The evidence was that this group is at an early stage, with meetings considering the terms of reference and also, recently, the most appropriate persons to contribute to the group.\n \n4.       In the circumstances I am concerned that currently there is an extant issue within the Trust about the completion of risk assessments being, on a number of occasions, unsatisfactory.

The summary document in Mr MORETON’s case was seen to be deficient in that it omitted his symptom of fever. It was heard in evidence a radiologist would need to telephone the department in question or go there to inspect the notes. Their awareness of a patient’s condition is based on a telephone call referral followed by a summary document which can be at odds with each.\n–  It is of concern that the use of telephone referral system and summary could contain errors and the radiologist must rely on this information, with no quick way to inspect a patient’s notes.\n–   The evidence also dealt with radiologists working in 2 hour triage shifts in a hectic environment where those clinicians receiving the referral seldom were the clinicians who carried out the imaging. The inference was the arrangement was susceptible to error.\n–  Over the course of the inquest evidence was heard on a number of issues where information passed to and from clinicians involved in Mr MORETON’s care was inaccurate and misleading.\n–  Assumptions were made that, Mr MORETON was improving clinically when a surgical opinion was sought, this was incorrect.\n–   It was assumed Mr MORETON would be referred for a surgical opinion by ED department clinicians, when in fact none took place.\n–  Clinicians in Newcastle Upon Tyne when asked for advice were under the impression treatment was working as it was mentioned his discharge from hospital was comptemplated\n– this was not the case.\n–   Overall I am concerned by the poor and misleading communications between clinicians, departments and Hospital Trusts on matters of vital importance to patient care."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 5th April 2023 an inquest was opened into the death of Brian David MORETON.

This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs.\n \nStaffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time.\n \nHealthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today.\n \nFollowing the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward.\n \nI was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward.\n \nSome three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers.\n \nAlthough initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work.\n \nThe evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution.\n \nThe indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majesty’s Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 15 March 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Haik Patrick NIKOLYAN aged 21.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nRiya’s mother took her to hospital a full day before Riya’s fatal collapse, because she believed that Riya was very sick. Unfortunately, the junior doctor who examined and assessed Riya failed to appreciate the severity of her condition. Instead of giving her intravenous antibiotics and admitting her to hospital, he diagnosed a virus and discharged her with advice to take over the counter painkillers and a sheet describing the management of sore throats.\n \nI intend to make a PFD report to the medical director of Northwick Park Hospital about the diagnosis and treatment of Riya’s condition. However, I am writing to you both because it seems to me that there is a fundamental issue regarding the lack of appropriate diagnosis and treatment that is apparent locally but relevant nationally.\n \nWhen Riya’s mother took her to hospital, she did so because it seemed to her that this illness was qualitatively very different from any other that Riya had suffered in her nine years. In short, Riya’s mum was convinced that Riya was extremely ill, she articulated clearly and at every stage in hospital why she thought that Riya was extremely ill, and she even questioned the doctor about whether this could be a group A streptococcal infection. (There was a well publicised outbreak at the time and the hospital had actually received an alert about this.)\n \nI heard at inquest that, even in the middle of the night, there was a consultant available to give a second opinion if this had been requested by medical personnel. However, no thought was given to seeking a second opinion. I think it highly likely that if it had been open to Riya’s family to seek a second opinion at that point, they would have done so without hesitation.\n \nOne of the reasons that coroners are local to an area is because this makes them better placed to recognise any local trends."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 30 December 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Riya Hirani, aged 9 years.

She had a past medical history of mixed schitzotypal and emotionally unstable personality disorder with traits of Asperger’s syndrome. She had mobility difficulties and required a bariatric bed due to concerns regarding skin integrity. She lived at home with her brother who cared for her. Lynsey Smalley was known to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) since 2005 and had a Care Coordinator who was a Community Psychiatric nurse. She was also open to a Psychiatrist and an Occupational therapist. On 6 April 2021 the CMHT were contacted by Lynsey’s brother who was concerned that Lynsey was acting strangely. A second call was made by her brother with concerns that Lynsey had relapsed and was displaying signs of paranoia, auditory and olfactory hallucinations, irritability, poor sleep and isolating herself in a particular room. A further call was made with reported concerns that Lynsey was lighting candles, had not used her prescribed oxygen and had not been eating, drinking, or sleeping for the past 4 days. It was indicated that there were only certain professionals Lynsey would agree to see but that she had agreed to see the care coordinator the following day. The GP prescribed medication and Lynsey’s brother was advised to contact Police if the situation became difficult. There was a total of 4 calls made by Lynsey’s brother to the out of hours crisis team. In addition, Lynsey’s brother contacted the emergency services for assistance. Police officers attended and a CID16 was completed and sent to the CMHT the following morning. By 9.10am on that same morning the CMHT reviewed the out of hours report. The care coordinator arrived at L’s home at 10.30am. Lynsey was reluctant to engage, and her brother reported concerns including that Lynsey had not slept for several nights, was not eating or drinking. He reported the incident overnight where Police had attended. The Care coordinator returned to the office and discussed with a psychiatrist, who agreed to visit that same day and the Advanced MH practitioner to assess and consider admission. After approximately 10 minutes of the care coordinator leaving Lynsey ignited a fire in the property. Emergency services were contacted. Lynsey was taken to Ysbyty Gwynedd, Bangor where she remained until she passed away on 16th May 2021."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows\na.       The Health Board provided 3 investigation reports into the death, two of which contained conflicting evidence. One responded to Lynsey’s brother’s complaint. It is clear that there was no strategic plan or collaboration in governance processes. Furthermore, there were a number of proposed actions which took nearly two years to identify and complete. The time it took to identify and complete actions, together with governance processes are matters which I have raised previously with the Health Board in previous Prevention of future Death Reports. If there are such disjointed patient safety and governance processes learning will not be effective and deaths will continue to occur or will occur into the future.\n \nA number of individuals and organisations are involved in the care of those under mental health teams or at times have contact with patients e.g. CMHT, Home Treatment Teams, Psychiatrists, Occupational therapists, Care Coordinators, out of hours crisis service (local authority based in Gwynedd), Police, Ambulance Service etc. As medical records remain paper based not all individuals or organisations who need to understand a patient’s circumstances/care/treatment are privy to all aspects of care/treatment. In addition, where a CMHT patient is receiving in-patient mental heath treatment the paper notes are transferred to the hospital setting. There is a risk that notes will become lost in full / in part. Having medical records electronically will not only allow full access to all notes to those who require which will inform future care/treatment but will also ensure effective continuity of care, without the risk of missing or lost notes.

He did not simply arrive at hospital,  but   had been assessed and then sent there by his GP, who felt, rightly as it turned out, that Derek may have developed an obstruction. He was anticipating   Derek would be seen quickly.\n \n·      He arrived at the Emergency Department, and handed in some paperwork at reception and understandably expected he would not have to wait long to be assessed by doctors who he knew were expecting him.\n \n·      No-one called for him for almost two hours by which time he had died.\n \n·      It is correct to say that once a post mortem examination was performed, it was clear that even if he had been assessed immediately upon arrival at hospital his condition was such that surgical intervention was not a realistic possibility and the condition was going to prove terminal.\n \n·      At the time Derek arrived, as the Hospital Trust’s own internal review of this death explained, such were the pressures on the hospital Trust posed by patient numbers that it was operating at OPEL [Operations Pressure Escalation Level] 4. This is a method used by the NHS to measure the stress, demands, and pressure a hospital is under. OPEL 4 represents the highest level, when a hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient\nsafety is at risk”."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \n·      Concern 1 – that the medical professionals who work in a hospital emergency department are routinely expected to do so when the OPEL 4 applies, a recognition they are performing their roles when the hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient safety is at risk”. Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.\n \n·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for. There is a clear risk that puts patients at risk and it would be remiss of me not to raise it.\n \n·      Concern 3 – Finally, it is relevant to point out that Derek had not moved for    some time before a medical professional called for Derek.  I  formed the  view that there had been a reluctance on his Friend’s part to request assistance due   to the pressures staff were clearly under, but also because he had already  handed in Derek’s paperwork and was expecting some assistance imminently which did not arrive. I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""The death of Harold Derek PEDLEY Otherwise known as Derek PEDLEY on 21.12.22 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th August 2023.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

Additional concerns were raised during triage and the matter was taken to a multi-disciplinary team. The team decided that Allison should be assessed face to face. They determined the case to be low risk and placed it in the green zone. The concerns shared with the service should have resulted in a more urgent face to face assessment. The assessment of Allison took place 9 months later. This was not a face-to-face assessment, as directed by the multi-disciplinary team. There was a telephone discussion, initially with Allison’s mother alone. Allison later spoke to the assessor but there was no full assessment of her mental state. There was no full exploration of the concerns raised in the referral and in the triage discussion. There was no evidence of the assessor determining the cause of Allison’s worrying presentation.\nThere was no carefully documented assessment of risk. There was no carefully devised risk management plan. A decision was made to discharge Allison from the mental health team, with no multi-disciplinary review or liaison with the referrer.

Following a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, in 2000, her mobility slowly declined, eventually losing the ability to stand and walk and becoming reliant on a mobility scooter."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""From the evidence I received, at the inquest, there are matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nDuring the inquest I heard evidence of the following matters:\n·       Shirley was an unusual local authority OT service user because she operated her hoist and sling mainly without the assistance of a carer because she wanted to maintain her independence and dignity as much as possible. Because she had mental capacity the OT service respected her wishes.\n·       Shirley’s husband who was the main carer at the time of her death did not receive any training from the local authority in safe usage of the hoist and in particular use of the red emergency pull cord. It was not clear whether Shirley had received any training on the use of the red pull cord when she was provided with the hoist because there was no paperwork confirming training had been delivered.\n·       I found that when Shirley was suspended in the hoist, she did not use the red pull cord, on the underside of the hoist unit, because it had not lowered and because her husband was able to use the hand control to manoeuvre her toward the scooter. He would not be able to do this if the red cord had been pulled because the electric power would switch off.\n·       Higher Elevation reported inspections of the hoist to the AMT but not to the OT department. The AMT, in turn, did not share those reports with the OT department.\n·       The Inspection by Bureau Veritas 30/6/23 only reported to AMT but not the OT dept. The AMT did not share the report with the OT department. I was informed that although the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1988 (LOLER) did not apply, nonetheless six-monthly inspections were performed on a voluntary basis.\n·       The last Bureau Veritas inspection was done without access to reports from Higher Elevation and email reports from Shirley to the OT department. Veritas reported there were no problems on its last inspection of 30/6/23 over 2 weeks before the death. That report was made without sight of the Shirley’s report to the OT department, on 9/4/21, and the Higher Elevation report to the AMT on the same day.\n·       I was also told by Shirley’s husband that the same model of hoist in the bathroom had also failed to lower on occasions.\n·       At present the bedroom hoist, and hoists in the bathroom and living room remain in situ at Shirley’s home and are available for inspection. Shirley was a local authority tenant when she died and due to pressure on its housing stock the local authority is anxious to re-let the property to new tenants. Therefore, it is desirable that the hoists are inspected in situ as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will have to be inspected whilst in local authority storage.\n·       I was reassured that the London Borough of Southwark is seeking to introduce guidance to its OT service to ensure the risk of recurrence in future is reduced in relation to service users operating hoist equipment unassisted in their homes. However, given my concern that recurrence should be avoided elsewhere in England and Wales I am reporting this to the MHRA to investigate and if necessary, alert and give guidance to other local authorities regarding the evidence which emerged during my investigation.\n  \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

His mental health then spiralled significantly in the four days proceeding the incident.

Detailed factual findings in Security Sensitive form are held by MOD and I request that you should have regard to the full Security Sensitive factual findings."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""I have been greatly assisted by detailed evidence from MOD on the changes made to the relevant aspects of military diving training since Ben’s death. From that evidence it is very clear that there has been a comprehensive and far-reaching review of policies, practices and organisational structures which will have very significantly reduced the risk of future fatalities. In several areas, the changes made go beyond those recommended by the Defence Safety Authority, and in nearly all other cases the recommendations have been adequately addressed. There are a few areas where there remains technological limitations to the response to the earlier DSA recommendations , but I am satisfied on the evidence I have heard that appropriate technological advances are being rapidly sought, with the risks in the meantime being mitigated by other means. Among over thirty recommendations arising from earlier investigations where extensive action has already been taken, there are four discrete areas in relation to which I assess that the Statutory threshold for me to make a Report to Prevent Future Deaths is met. Accordingly, it is still the case that during the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to conce rn. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you .\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(1)  A stand-by diver was present at the dive exercise and he was deployed to try to find and rescue Ben. However, the stand-by diver had to surface having run out of breathable gas before Ben was found. A spare breathing apparatus cylinder was not carried in the safety boat for the stand-by diver (or other divers) to use in the event that the stand-by diver’s main cylinder ran out.\n \n(2)  The progression of the dive training in which Ben was engaged was safety-critical. The progression of training was accelerated for several reasons, one of which was a visit by a high-ranking naval officer. The concern of the instructing staff was to polish the drills ahead of that visit and to take the pressure off the dive students by allowing them to practise\nthe dive with relevant equipment ahead of the visit. This acceleration of safety-critical training in part because of such a visit was not appropriate.\n \n(3)  Ben was lifted unconscious from the sea bed and Cardio Pulmonary Resuscitation was immediately started. A defibrillator was also applied, but this was only available because it was carried by a Harbour Patrol vessel which came to assist. I am concerned that in such safety-critical military diving training, the dive support staff did not have available to them a defibrillator of their own either on the supporting safety boats or on land. This did not cause or contribute to Ben’s death but could lead to future fatalities.\n \n(4) There is an inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus as between the maintenance manual for which DE&S is responsible and all other policy and safety guidance."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 26 November 2018 the Senior Coroner for Dorset commenced an investigation into the death of BENJAMIN DAVID MCQUEEN, aged 26. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held by me as nominated Judge Coroner from 10 to 28 July 2023. "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""(1)   As to carrying a spare breathing apparatus cylinder in safety boats in addition to that carried by the stand-by diver where this is practicable, I am reassured that this appears to be happening in practice in Ben’s former unit. But I have a concern that this does not yet appear in policy guidance and it is a safety concern that may need to be more widely shared in defence.\n \n(2)   As to avoiding visits by senior ranking Officers or VIP visitors to training courses leading to an acceleration of safety-critical training, I am reassured that action has been taken in Ben’s former unit such that this should not recur in relation to the relevant diving training. But I have a concern as to whether this has been shared more widely amongst other military units.\n \n(3)   As to the availability of defibrillators, I was informed that they are present at some, but not all, dive sites used by Ben’s former Unit. The risk assessment suggesting that defibrillators are not required because of the age/health profile of those attending the diving training appears to focus upon the risk of myocardial infarction (or similar) from a natural cause or routine exercise, rather than the risk of cardiac arrest / heart arrythmias caused by traumatic injury when carrying out arduous military diving.\n \n(4)   As to the inconsistency regarding the minimum safety pressure level for the relevant diver’s breathing apparatus, I was informed that the relevant operators would not need to consult the detailed maintenance manual such that confusion should not occur.

I am not satisfied that the risk of re-occurrence has been properly addressed.\n \n2.       The clinicians treating Ms Nakafeero assessed her VTE risk utilising an established algorithm based on national guidance. The assessment was undertaken appropriately but it failed to identify two risk factors which made the formation of a DVT more likely, namely, large uterine fibroids and the use of tranexamic acid.

The desperation engendered by her delusional and medically entirely unfounded beliefs led to a number of suicide attempts and both voluntary and compulsory admissions to mental health units.   On the pt May 2021 Jo had attempted suicide [REDACTED] , some five weeks later, she would end her life. In the light of this incident her community risk assessment, her care plan and her safety plan were not up-dated – as they had not been since the date of her last discharge as a mental health in-patient on the 18th December 2020.\n \nWhilst her high risk of suicide was acknowledged by the community mental health team responsible for her safety – and care, management and treatment – in the community, and notwithstanding the context of the Covid-19 pandemic, I found an inappropriate over-reliance upon her family members, principally her husband and son, to keep Jo safe in the community. This involved the family monitoring Jo 24 hours a day, seven days a week over an extended period and physically preventing her from leaving her home address unaccompanied .\n \nThis over-reliance was misguided and placed an unfair and unsustainable burden on the family, particularly in the light of a highly concerning text message sent by Jo to her Care Coordinator threatening suicide on the 11th June, the day before she took her own life. Following receipt of the text and seemingly reassured in part by Jo’s apparent retraction of the threat later that day, there was a failure to undertake an urgent face to face assessment by the community team to establish whether a referral to the Crisis Team was necessary; this specific failure possibly contributed to the subsequent death.\n \nIn the circumstances I concluded that an inappropriate over-reliance upon family members to keep such a vulnerable and high-risk person safe in the community, over an extended period of time, probably contributed to Jo taking her own life on the 12th June 2021."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The evidence also confirmed that the lack of clarity as to the timing and conduct of CC handovers and the absence of an allocated CC to work with Jo (and by extension, her family) was informed by lack of a formal policy or procedure requiring that a full, detailed, formal record of handover between Care Coordinators is to be placed on EPUT electronic records.\n \n3.    Evidence confirmed a conspicuous lack of clarity as to who, amongst EPUT clinicians/staff, has the responsibilitv for oversight of patient carefollowing discharge, including responsibility for ensuring adequate and appropriate safety-netting is in place in the event of relapse, where a Care Coordinator is no longer in place/has not been replaced.\n \nPlease note that this 3rd concern was previously raised by me with\n–               CEO of EPUT (and in very similar terms) in a PFDR dated 25.02.2022 following the death of Stephanie Moyce.\n \n4.

The condition was untreatable but palliative chemotherapy was planned. However, on the 27th May 2022 and the 3rd June 2022, the Deceased was re-admitted with non- resolving pneumonia which was treated with anti-biotics. His symptoms worsened and he was found to have a recurrent pericardial effusion and, on the 5th June 2022, he was transferred to St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London for a “pericardial window” to be performed. However, before going to theatre, the Deceased suffered a cardiac arrest. He was resuscitated and intubated, and he underwent an emergency pericardiocentesis before transfer to the Intensive Treatment Unit. Despite support, attempts to wean the Deceased from sedation were unsuccessful, and he developed multi-organ failure and died at 17.30 hours on the 10th June 2022.\n \nIn 2020, whilst being investigated by the colorectal service at Queens Hospital, a CT scan performed in November 2020 raised the possibility of a malignant process in the lung but this report was not seen by the clinical team. If it had been seen, it is likely that annual review and monitoring would have been arranged and this may have enabled the lung tumour which subsequently developed to have been diagnosed and treated before it reached stage 4. There was, therefore, a lost opportunity to monitor for and, possibly, to diagnose and treat, the lung cancer. However, it is possible that the tumour, which probably developed quickly, would not have been found even by annual review. Consequently, on the evidence, it is not possible to ascertain whether monitoring probably would, or would not, have prevented the Deceased’s death."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""Background:\n1.     The evidence at the inquest showed that the results of two separate scans performed on the Deceased, both of which had concerning outcomes, were not seen and acted upon in a timely manner.\n \n2.     First, on the 8th October 2020, a Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at Queens Hospital requested a CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax, abdomen and pelvis because the Deceased had reported significant weight loss and other symptoms. The radiologist’s report on the scan, dated the 8th November 2020, mentioned findings of multiple lung nodules and included a differential diagnosis of lung metastases. This outcome was never seen by the requesting clinician, nor any other clinician (including the Deceased’s General Practitioner). I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy; I was told that “the reporter would not raise this as an incidental finding because malignancy was already queried and would expect the referring clinician to review results”. The Consultant Colorectal Surgeon told me, however, that his understanding of the system was that he would be alerted to any finding or suspicion of malignancy. Further, although the Deceased had subsequently been given three outpatients appointments, the error was not picked up through these because all three appointments were cancelled by the hospital and the Deceased was not seen by the colorectal team again.\n \n3.     Secondly, a further CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax was undertaken on the 9th April 2022, but the formal report (suspicious for lung cancer) was not made until the 24th May 2022, and this resulting in delay in the Deceased being seen on the cancer pathway by the respiratory team. It seems that the delay in reporting was because a second hospital number had been used for the Deceased when the scan was performed in an external CT scanner located on the King George Hospital site.\n \n4.     At the inquest, I heard oral evidence from [REDACTED] , and I received documentary evidence, explaining the changes which have been made since the Deceased’s death. The documentation received included an 11 point Action Plan, supported by evidence as to the action that has been taken. On the basis of that evidence, I am satisfied that most of the concerns relating to the Deceased’s scan reporting and other management have been addressed.\n \n5.     I do, however, have two ongoing concerns about the system in place for the communication of concerning radiological findings. Steps have been taken to improve the system previously in place. In particular, I have been provided with a copy of the Trust’s new “Radiology Unsuspected Cancers and Critical Findings Protocol” which, I am told, has now been approved, and will be adopted, by the Radiology Clinical Leads and Clinical Governance Leads across North East London. I was also told that a new electronic scan requesting and reporting system will “go live” in August 2023, and that this will enable unexpected cancers and other incidental critical findings to be “red-flagged” directly to the requesting team. The system will also have an “acknowledgment option” enabling the referring doctor to click on a read receipt for all radiology reports.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows:\nConcern 1:\nThe Trust’s new policy is concerned with ensuring that unexpected cancer or other critical radiological findings are highlighted to the requesting team. However, the evidence at the inquest suggested that requesting team were not alerted to the suspicious outcome of the Deceased’s November 2020 scan because it was an expected finding; as stated above, I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy and the outcome was not, therefore, treated as unexpected. I am concerned, therefore, that the same could happen again, despite the changes which have been made. I did not consider that [REDACTED] was able to address this concern satisfactorily in his evidence.\n \nConcern 2:\nThe new electronic system is introducing a “read receipt” feature which, if used, would enable identification of reports which have not been opened and read by the requesting team in a timely manner. I am concerned, however, that the use of the read receipt is optional as this will inevitably undermine the extent to which any monitoring system will be able to spot and identify unread reports. I did not consider that either [REDACTED], nor the Consultant Colorectal Surgeon from whom I heard evidence about the plans for monitoring in the surgical department of Queens Hospital, were able to address this concern satisfactorily in their evidence."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter John Harris, aged 73 years, who died at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital, London on the 10th June 2022.

The inquest heard evidence that the speed and quality of that referral was impacted by the way in which information was shared between clinicians in different trusts within Greater Manchester. The use of different systems and reliance on postal services and lack of a clear, effective electronic system of referrals including transfer of images /notes meant there were delays in assessing patients which led to a delay in formulating a treatment plan in tertiary services;\n \n2. The evidence also indicated that there were delays in patients who had been identified as requiring cardiology input being seen in cardiology clinics due to availability of clinicians/appointment slots inquest.

On the 19 December 2022 he was stepped down from intensive care to a ward. He was at a very high risk of developing a thromboembolism due to his cancer diagnosis, recent surgery, lengthy period in hospital and immobility.

The reason for refusal is unclear and there is no documented evidence that the risk of non-compliance with the medication was explained to him or escalated to the medical team. On the 20 January 2023, Mr. James suffered from an acute deterioration in his health, culminating in a cardiac arrest.

There is no electronic prompt/alert to highlight to the medical team when prescribed anticoagulation medication is not administered.\n \nThe Trust’s internal investigator recognised that a fail-safe should be put in place within the electronic records, to ensure escalation to the medical team where doses of prescribed anti- coagulation are not administered.

For a variety of reasons, a home birth was against medical advice, this had been explained on a number of occasions throughout the pregnancy. On the 17th December 2021 advice to transfer to hospital had been given by midwives during early labour due to concerns that Sinon’s mother was showing signs of pre-eclampsia and due to findings of light meconium staining on rupture of membranes which could indicate fetal distress. This advice was not accepted. At 12:47 it was identified that Sinon maybe an undiagnosed breech presentation, transfer to hospital was recommended and declined. Up to that time presentation based on abdominal palpitation and vaginal examinations had been assessed as cephalic. A frank breech presentation was confirmed during a 999 call commencing at 13:00. Paramedics arrived at scene at 13:07 and transfer to hospital was again advised and not accepted. The presenting part delivered at 13:14, there was then a 27 minute period before delivery of Sinon’s head causing a catastrophic hypoxic brain injury. He received resuscitation and was transferred to Birmingham Heartlands Hospital arriving at 49 minutes of age. At 57 minutes Sinon was found to have a heartbeat, he was ventilated and cooled but remained comatose and subsequently developed signs of encephalopathy and multi organ failure, a decision was made to provide palliative care on the 20th December and Sinon died at 05:15 on the 21st December 2021.   "",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows \n1. The University Hospitals of Birmingham NHS Foundations Trust (‘UHB’) has specific guidance covering home birth against medical advice in the form of ‘Birth Choices Guidance, CG1200, June 2021’ and ‘Homebirth Including Risk Assessment, CG1143, August 2021’.\n \n2. Specifically, Section 5 of the Birth Choices Guidance includes:\n \n“5.1 All women requesting birth outside of guidance must be referred for discussion to the consultant midwife via BadgerNet for decision-making regarding their birth choices.\n….\n5.7.  Where there are complexities that require the input of other professionals and if the woman remains undecided or voices a decisive choice to pursue a plan outside of Trust guidance a joint multiprofessional appointment must be arranged.\n5.8.  This appointment should include the consultant midwife; the woman’s named obstetric consultant and other relevant professionals/clinicians as needed. The consultant midwife will convene the multiprofessional team meeting with the purpose of ensuring that a comprehensive multiprofessional pregnancy and birth plan is formulated.\n5.9.  There may be occasions when the multiprofessional team cannot meet. In these circumstances it is acceptable for the multiprofessional team to see the woman separately. However, the team members must still agree a plan together and document this on the woman’s records.”\n \n3. Evidence given at the inquest pertaining to the current situation was that the system outlined in section 5.8 of the Birth Choices Guidance is not in operation at all. Evidence was given by UHB’s Community Matron that without the input of a Consultant Obstetrician at the multiprofessional appointment, things might be missed in the birth plan, and the information given by the Consultant Midwife and Community Midwives may not carry the same weight with the patient as hearing the opinion of the Consultant Obstetrician.

She was assessed as being suitable for step 4 therapy. However at the time of the assessment of her need there was a 2 year waiting list to access therapy. On the balance of probabilities this delay possibly contributed to her death. On 11th April 2019, 17th July 2019, 28th July 2019, 17th January 2020 and 8th May 2020 she was dealt with by British Transport Police (BTP) and indicated suicidal thoughts. Following the incident on 8th May 2020 BTP prosecuted her for obstructing the railways when she had indicated she had suicidal ideation at the time she was on the railway. She was subsequently arrested on a warrant and held in custody before being sentenced. On the balance of probabilities this decision to prosecute possibly contributed to the deterioration in her mental health and her subsequent death. On 1st August 2020 following calls to the mental health crisis line she was referred for a mental health assessment by the Primary Care Mental Health Team (PCMHT) part of Cheshire & Wirral partnership NHS Trust (CWP). On 3rd September 2020 she was assessed by telephone by the PCMHT and then the case was referred to the PCMHT MDT. On 6th September she rang Cheshire Police from Delamere Forrest with suicidal thoughts. She was taken to Hospital and discharged the following day. On 9th September 2020 her case was considered by the PCMHT MDT. They determined her needs were too complex for the PCMHT and she was to be referred to the Community Mental Health Team (CMHT) part of CWP. The referral was not made until 16th September 2020. At the point of referral she was discharged from the PCMHT caseload. On 17th September 2020 she presented at Stepping Hill Hospital with suicidal thoughts. She was assessed by mental health services and discharged. On 23rd September 2020 she was discussed at the CMHT MDT where the referral was rejected and she was to be referred back to the PCMHT. She was discharged from the CMHT caseload at that point. She was no longer on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT. Despite the complexity of her needs and her deteriorating mental health there was no discussion between the PCMHT and the CMHT in relation as to how to manage or mitigate the risk at this point although it was documented that she felt rejected by mental health services. On the balance of probabilities the poor communication between the PCMHT and the CMHT, the failure to assess risk effectively to ensure she remained on the caseload of either the PCMHT or the CMHT probably contributed to the further decline in her mental health and her death.

He should have been transferred by 2230 on the 10 July 2022, but was not transferred until 0930 on the 11 July 2023. Matthew’s family observed that only one of two bottles of antibiotics prescribed to Matthew in A&E were administered to him. Matthew was not observed as closely as he should have been, given his very concerning clinical condition and there were delays in carrying out necessary blood tests and in commencing renal replacement therapy. The inquest has found however that Matthew presented to hospital on the 10 July 2022 with a likely acute kidney injury, associated with sepsis.

All tests were normal and she was reviewed by the OPAL team at 12.15 when she was noted to be pain free so she was discharged home at 15.15. She reattended the emergency department on 29/10/22 and was referred to the surgical team who reviewed her at 11.30. She complained of colicky abdominal pain and was passing wind but had not had bowels open for 4 days. She was complaining of severe pain but had normal observations and the initial diagnosis was acute diverticulitis. However the doctor was contemplating CT scan but incorrectly decided to wait for blood test results before proceeding. Due to workload the doctor came to review blood tests results at 20.00 but which time she had self discharged. These showed a slightly raised white cell count however the clinical decision at time was that she did not need to be recalled. During this attendance no clear plan was set out in the records about how to proceed with her care and the extent of her pain coupled with reattendance was not identified as indicating she was a high risk patient and her case was not escalated for consultant review. On balance a CT scan should have been arranged at this time which would have identified the condition and provided an opportunity for earlier surgery. She represented on 30/10/22 shocked and profoundly unwell with suspicion of an ischaemic bowel which was confirmed on CT scan and found to be due to adhesions constricting the bowel from previous hysterectomy surgery. She was rushed to theatre where the ischaemic bowel was resected; however, she failed to recover and sadly passed away on 31/10/22.

He had attended on the 9th July 2022 after visiting the nearby Urgent Care Centre (UCC) and being referred to ED by the GP there. He was provided with a printout of his consultation with her. She was worried about him. That communication detailed his complaint of loose stools and abdominal pain. The triage nurse did not record the content of the UCC letter accurately and took that letter from Mr Blewitt. He later saw the ED doctor who did not see or read the UCC letter or attempt to source it. The ED doctor did not record any questions relating to bowel habit on his contemporaneous note, but sometime subsequent to Mr Blewitt’s death wrote a statement in which he identified that he had and that there were no bowel complaints. This was despite several days of being faecally incontinent at home and highlighting this to the UCC doctor. The ED doctor sent him home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant or recurrent urinary tract infection even though the MSU taken by his GP a few days earlier and available to the UCC doctor showed no growth. Mr Blewitt, even though he was sent home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant urinary tract infection on the 9th July 2022, was told to continue the original antibiotics his GP had started him on and then to start the new ones the next day. Mr Blewitt spent a difficult two days with faecal incontinence and abdominal pain before returning on the 11th July 2022 to the ED. At this visit a possible acute abdomen was diagnosed and CT scanning confirmed this. He was taken to theatre and suffered a cardiac arrest before surgery and died the next day on ITU. It emerged in evidence that there were no reliable records of any fluid resuscitation in the ED available for examination. This is because the computerised system records the prescription of IV fluids but unless the prescription is signed, that prescribed item is erased. The best information I received was that he had received two litres of an unknown fluid at some point during his time in the ED. It seems that doctors were not as a routine signing the prescriptions and so no reliable record was retained. I was told that doctors had been reminded on the need to sign prescriptions but no audit of this had been carried out since Mr Blewitt’s death."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \n[1]  At the time of Mr Blewitt’s death there was no effective, reliable recording of intravenous fluids administered to patients in the emergency department. That in my view has potential to represent a threat to the safety and lives of patients suffering with a wide variety of different conditions. The author of the SI report who attended to give evidence did not, at the time of Inquest 8 months later, was unable to demonstrate that the Trust had remedied that.\n[2]  Despite the 8 month interval between Mr Blewitt’s death and the Inquest the issues of concern had not been brought to the attention of hospital authorities.\n[3]  On arrival at the ED a triage nurse summarised the communication from the urgent care centre. The triage nurse missed important points during the transcription. The attending doctor did not concern himself to look at the communication himself.\n[4]  I was concerned that the treating doctor made a contemporaneous note on the 9th July 2022 at Mr Blewitt’s first presentation which failed to record the major presenting symptom, diarrhoea with faecal incontinence, which Mr Blewitt had communicated to the urgent care doctor who in turn had included that in her notes and letter to the ED. The treating doctor did record a flatly contradictory note to the effect there was no change in bowel habit.\n[5] The Incident Investigation Report which is in part designed to assist with learning from adverse events was of a generally poor standard. There was a failure to consider issues in detail; there was a failure to challenge the statements of clinicians where there were obvious contradictions between statements made and the medical record; there was a failure to put in place measures to correct and monitor prescribing clinicians failure to sign off on IV fluid prescriptions so that the contemporaneous record would be available for clinicians coming after them and they could see whether a patient had satisfactory or unsatisfactory fluid management.

She used an insulin pump to administer insulin and had done so since 2005.\n \nii) She had recently had a dental procedure and was also recently prescribed antibiotics for an infection. It was accepted by clinicians that this can cause a Type 1 diabetic to need more insulin than they would normally need.\n \niii) On the 3 December 2021, Sandra Diane Finches glucose levels start to rise. This is picked up by the pump that she used and this sounded regular alarms and gave correctional doses of insulin.\n \niv) On the 4 December 2021 Sandra Diane Finch called the West Midlands Ambulance Service and told them she was feeling more sleepy, her glucose was high and she had been vomiting. The categorisation of this call was category 3. This meant she was a medical emergency and required an ambulance. However, before an ambulance could be dispatched a clinical review Was required by the CV team.\n \nv) The team was under staffed and had no time limit attached for an assessment. As such, an attempt for an assessment did not take place until\n10  hours  later.  At 7:22 a call was made to Miss Finch. This was unanswered. The options available, at this stage, would have been to dispatch an ambulance, or to place the call back, back into the CV Teams work load. This was what happened.\n \nvi)  At 12:47 on the 5 December 2023 the decision was made by the team to categorise the ambulance request as a category 2 and dispatch an ambulance. This arrived  at Sandra Diane Finches address at 13:08 and  she was found to have passed away as a result of ketoacidosis.\n \nvii) Clinical opinion disagreed that category three was the correct categorisation. It should be have been a category 2. Evidence was heard that the pathway had to be followed rigidly so a computer could decide the category, but accepted that a clinician listening to the answers may well have made a different decision and given the call a category 2 marking.\n \nThe view of clinicians was that had the ambulance been despatched within the accepted time limit for a category 3 ambulance, Sandra Diane Finch would not have died when she did."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

This led to a type 1 diabetic patient, who was feeling sleepy and with deranged glucose levels, not being classed as a potentially serious situation requiring rapid intervention. Clinical opinion in agreement that this was, but the rigidly of the pathway meant it was categorised incorrectly.\n \nThat the use of an assessment team, to asses a category 3 ambulance call, with no time limit for assessments to take place, and no prioritisation system, will lead to further deaths resulting from delays."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 9th October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Ms Sandra Diane Finch.

There was no joint multi-disciplinary risk assessment and risk management plan on discharge from the teams. The practitioners were aware that Conrad was not taking a therapeutic dose of medication at the time of discharge, but no medical review was arranged for him. At the time of discharge from services, Conrad was also accessing treatment from an aesthetic dermatology clinic. This was not taken into account in his discharge risk assessment.

The expert and the Trust’s own Head of Midwifery advised that this was not appropriate. It therefore does not appear that the learning has been passed on to all Trust Midwives and there is a risk that in future cases those treating the baby will be falsely reassured by normal cord pH results which may not be accurate.\n \nWhile I read evidence of some training that had been provided in response to HSIB recommendations for further training on auscultation in addition to saturation monitoring and ECG monitoring during resuscitation, the independent expert also recommended training on UVC and IO access. I am also concerned that there does not appear to have been training in relation to the provision of blood transfusions in such cases to ensure that all potential reversible causes are treated before resuscitation stops.

At the time of his death Samuel was suffering from alcohol addiction and had a diagnosis of ADHD and social anxiety. Prior to his death Samuel had received treatment from the Community Drug and Alcohol Treatment (‘CDAT’) team and primary mental health services. Samuel was discharged from CDAT fifteen months prior to his death. CDAT had information on their system (including from their own risk assessment) to indicate that Samuel had been assessed as a significant risk of suicide. There was other valuable information about Samuel’s risk factors on the CDAT system. At the time when Samuel was under CDAT the GP had also referred Samuel to the community mental health team raising his concerns about Samuel’s risk of suicide. It is not clear is CDAT had access to this letter. When the primary mental health services consultant began treating Samuel for his ADHD – which continued up to Samuel’s death – he received a referral from CDAT but he did not have access to the detailed information on the CDAT electronic system.

The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis – such as substance misuse and mental health – given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care-coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual.\n \nI am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk that information of significance regarding a risk to life will be lost between agencies and not sufficiently understood between all those managing."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 13th May 2019 an investigation was commenced into the death of Samuel Alexander Morgan who was found deceased in his parents’ house on the 9th May 2019 after having tied a ligature around his neck.

Whilst ACCT 6 requires multidisciplinary attendance at review meetings, this case highlighted the need for specific attendance of an RMN or other mental health expert at any review, (Mr Robinson had repeatedly self harmed prior to committing suicide but had presented without concern at each review which had been carried out without any input from the mental health team). The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending. This has enabled the prison to identify issues which may not be picked up by other professionals involved, to enable support to be put in place by way of separate care plans which has had a notable impact upon SASH in the prison."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 05 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stuart Michael ROBINSON aged 20.

However, there was limited evidence on what the optimum number of dilatations were and/or when to stop and move to consider stenting.\n \nThe inquest heard that stenting of patients in these circumstances has a limited body of evidence regarding the risk.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \n1.     The evidence heard during the course of the inquest highlighted an inconsistency between the literature provided by the manufacturer of sertraline (the patient information leaflet (‘PIL’)) and the British National Formulary (‘BNF’) produced by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (latest version: BNF 85, March 2023).\n \n2.     The PIL contains a list of “uncommon” side effect of suicidal behaviour, which includes the following in bold: “Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during sertraline therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 2).”\n \n3.     The BNF relating to Depression (3.4, p395) and the use of Antidepressant Drugs states under the heading “Suicidal depression and antidepressant therapy” (p397): “The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children young adults and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour and particularly suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.”\n \n4.     The section of the BNF relating to SSRIs (p401) also identifies “suicidal behaviours”\nas a potential uncommon side-effect.\n \n5.     However, the section with respect to sertraline does not specifically identify suicidal tendencies at all, although it does identify “thinking abnormal” as an uncommon side effect (p.405).\n \n6.     I am concerned that there is a risk that a medical practitioner consulting the BNF with a view to determining dosage and treatment with Sertraline will be unaware of the potential risk of the onset of suicidal behaviour and/or would not consider it necessary to discuss that risk with the patient. The evidence heard at the inquest suggested that it would not be appropriate or practical for GPs to consider PILs before prescribing.\n \nOn the other hand, the PIL and BNF are intended for different purposes. It may be that the evidence of risk of suicidal ideation associated with Sertraline specifically (as opposed to SSRIs) is so low that it need not be referred to in the BNF, notwithstanding its inclusion in the PIL. Nevertheless, this is a matter of concern that would in my view benefit from further consideration."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 18 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joshua Fynn ASPREY aged 19.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. \n1.     A failure to adequately assess risk of harm – Poor record keeping and a failure to read electronic records meant that important information was not considered at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (“MD T”) ward round on 6th April 2021. The MDT arrived at a conclusion that Mr Charles’ risk of self-harm was “no risk”. A psychologist’s assessment on the clinical record that assessed Mr Charles risk of self-harm as high on 31/3/21 was neither read nor incorporated into the MDT discussion.\n \n2.     A decision to reduce observation frequency made by the MDT on 6/4/21 was not supported by the Trust Policy guidance which indicated that enhanced observations were appropriate.\n \n3.     A failure to ensure that a treatment plan was followed – observations between\n16.00 and 17.00 on the day of Mr Charles’ death were suspended by the ward shift co-ordinator. The decision meant all patients subject to general observation on the ward were ignored.\n \n4.     Failures to respond to an emergency adequately – The Trust described the emergency response as chaotic . Staff agreed that they “panicked ” and did not follow policy, specific issues include;\na.     A ward emergency bell was not sounded,\nb.     An anti-barricade key was not used to open Mr Charles’ door, instead the door was forced open causing a risk of harm to Mr Charles .\nc.     A ligature cutter could not be used promptly as it was secured in a box with a combination lock – staff did not know the combination,\nd.     Duty doctors were not called promptly,\ne.     Oxygen administration was delayed,\nf.       An on-site defibrillator was not used by staff\ng.     Staff could or would not provide a clear and relevant history to paramedics.\n \n5.     The credibility of evidence provided by Trust staff.\na.     Two Trust witnesses declined to answer questions put to them regarding whether their observation records were truthful.\nb. Observation records appeared to have been created utilising a “cut and paste” function.\nc. Records often inaccurately recorded the prescribed frequency of observation.\nd. Factually inaccurate entries were made in the record following Mr Charles’ death. On 11th April 2021 an entry stated that Mr Charles was, “Awake in his bedroom sitting on his bede (sic)” at 07.21. On 12th April two entries made at 9.48 and 11.40 recorded that Mr Charles’ was alive and well. Senior Trust witnesses characterised these entries as dishonest.\n \n6.     Governance process failings.\na.     A datix incident report created on the evening of 10th April 2021 by a senior nurse and Modern Matron contained misleading information that suggested that emergency response policies were followed when in fact they were not.\nb.     The Datix failed to mention that observations had been suspended by the shift coordinator, a fact that was understood at that time. This obvious and significant piece of information that should have been escalated through the Trust governance team for action.\nC. The Trust 72 hour report was written by the Modern Matron and was signed-off by an integrated care director on 15th April 2021. This document also failed to identify or escalate the significant issue of the suspension of observation at 16.00 on 10th April 2021.\nd.

He died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital on the 3rd March 2022.\n \nAs part of the investigation, I reviewed the medical records.

She expressed suicidal thoughts and plans [REDACTED].\n \nShe was diagnosed with postpartum depression. She was advised to become an informal patient in the NHS but there was no bed available so she would have had to wait in the hospital until a bed could be found. She decided to seek a private admission the following day.\n \nOn the 15th March 2022 she sought treatment at the Priory Hospital, Woking. She had a preadmission assessment with [REDACTED] a consultant psychiatrist who accepted her as a patient. She told him that she had a suicide plan but did not provide details of what it was. He assessed her as a high risk of suicide and set observations at four times an hour. She was allocated a Key Worker who was not due to be in the hospital until 22nd March 2022, and a Co-worker, who had a one-to-one with her on 19th March 2022. Her overall mental health appeared to have improved when she was reviewed by [REDACTED] on March 18th 2022. The observation level\nwas reduced to twice an hour on the 16th March 2022, and then further to\nonce an hour on the morning of March 21st 2022, on each occasion without a risk assessment being performed as specified in the Priory policy.\n \nLater on the morning of the 21st March 2022 Miss Henderson made comments during a therapy session which indicated that her mental health was deteriorating. The therapists recorded what she had said in her notes, but the concerns were not considered to be serious enough to be escalated to the nursing team. Evidence presented to the inquest suggests that Amy’s observations should have been increased at this stage. Amy was not reviewed by the nursing team when the therapists’ notes were uploaded onto the system at 16.06 on 21st March 2022. The information was not reviewed and therefore not acted upon.\n \nMiss Henderson was last seen in person at 18.02 in the dining room. At\n18.12. she entered the downstairs disabled toilet. The disabled toilet had been identified in risk assessments as a high-risk area but it was not locked. She wrote a farewell note to her parents at 18.14.

In his later years he developed cognitive impairment, which in turn led to him being at very high risk of falls. This risk, in relation to which he needed constant supervision, was known to those caring for him and to those responsible for looking after him when he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was admitted to the hospital Emergency Department not because he himself was experiencing a medical emergency, but as a last resort after exhaustive efforts to explore all options before Will was admitted to hospital: it proved not to be possible to find suitable alternative care for him in residential care placements while his wife, and main carer, underwent unplanned emergency major surgery.\n \nThe inquest heard evidence that, prior to his admission to hospital, at least eight social care providers were contacted plus further residential homes, but none of them could provide emergency care for Will. The inquest heard undisputed evidence that this was an instance of a national care shortage.\n \nThe inquest heard evidence that in an Emergency Department where many patients are suffering medical emergencies constant one-to-one supervision will not always be possible. I found as a fact that it was not possible on this occasion and that Will’s fall in the Emergency Department took place when the nursing assistant who was trying to maintain constant one-to-one supervision of Will insofar as possible had their attention momentarily diverted to another patient experiencing a medical emergency. I judged that it would not be just to describe this as a failure on the part of the nursing assistant or the Emergency Department staff.\n \nThe reason why it was not an individual failure included that the inquest heard evidence that the hospital, and in particular the Emergency Department, was experiencing significant pressures associated with high demand and an internal critical incident had been declared. There was a high demand for beds within the hospital without the availability of beds to meet the demand. This included the facts that there were, at the time of Will’s arrival in the Emergency Department, 50 patients in the Emergency Department, of whom 32 were waiting for bed placement. Moreover, staffing was at a ‘black status’ (the worst level) across the hospital, with a deficiency of staff of around 60 nurses and nursing assistants.\n \nI found as a fact that those severe pressures – the high demand levels and the deficiency of staff and scarcity of resource – contributed to the death. Firstly, if it had been possible to care for and supervise Will on a constant basis as he needed, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.\n \nSecondly, on the balance of probabilities, the scarcity of resource relative to demand contributed to Will not being transferred to a ward – or other more appropriate environment – sooner.\n \nApart from the inherent particular difficulties in providing constant supervision in an Emergency Department referred to above, the inquest also received undisputed evidence that the environment of a busy, noisy Emergency Department, with lights on at all hours of the day and night would be overly stimulating and not the most suitable environment for someone with cognitive impairment who was experiencing confusion and agitation. I found that such an environment probably contributed to Will’s inclination to wander and so to his fall.\n \nIf it had been possible to transfer Will to a more suitable environment sooner, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.\n \nI found as a fact that, on the balance of probabilities, the lack of availability of more appropriate care contributed to the death."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \n1)  A national care shortage contributed to a situation where a gentleman who was not experiencing a medical emergency, but who required constant supervision for his own safety in view of his cognitive impairment and very high falls risk, could not be cared for anywhere other than in a hospital Emergency Department. If there is not sufficient provision of care, including residential care placements, such that those in similar need do not receive suitable care, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths will occur or continue to exist in the future, when they are placed in an environment that is not realistically able to provide the constant supervision needed, as occurred in this case.\n \nThe severe pressures on the hospital, including the Emergency Department, were such that they were experiencing scarcity of resource relative to demand and a severe deficiency of staff. In these circumstances, it was both not possible to provide the care and supervision that Will needed in the Emergency Department, and the scarcity of resource contributed to Will not being transferred sooner to a ward or other more appropriate environment, where Will could receive the constant supervision that would probably have prevented the fall that led to his death. The evidence was that the scarcity of resource experienced was a challenge on the national level, rather than just a particular local issue. If hospitals, including Emergency Departments, do not receive sufficient resource, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths, due to an inability to provide the required care and / or prompt transfer to an available ward bed or appropriate alternative place, will occur or continue to exist in the future."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 18th March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Joseph Willy Maunick.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th April 2023.

However, on 29 May 2022, he had a mild viral infection (which was confirmed at post-mortem).\n \nChester was placed in a bath seat and given a bath in suitably warm water. The water level was higher than advised – so that Chester did not get chilled.\n \nAfter about 20 minutes of bath time, Chester was left alone in his bath seat whilst a plug- in diffuser (to help his cold) was prepared in his bedroom. It was believed that the bath seat was safe and secure to hold him in place.\n \nAfter a few minutes, Chester was found face down in the bath. The bath seat had become unfixed. There were no sounds that Chester was in distress or difficulty. He was immediately removed from the bath and given immediate CPR by a trained adult.\nEmergency services were quickly on scene and CPR was continued by police, paramedics and clinicians. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved.\n \nChester was flown by air ambulance to the Great North Children’s Hospital at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. However, an MRI scan undertaken on 2 June 2022 showed that Chester had an extensive severe brain injury consistent with severe global hypoxic ischaemia caused by drowning. It was considered that Chester was unlikely to survive and further intensive care treatment was not in his best interest.\n \nIntensive care support was withdrawn on 3 June 2022 and Chester died peacefully in his mother’s arms at 18:05.\n \nI received a statement from RoSPA (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) setting out that:\n \n·       Baby bath seats are unstable and prone to toppling over leaving the baby trapped in the water.\n·       Bath seats may give parents and carers a false sense of security that baby is safer in a bath seat and can be left alone (despite warnings that this should not happen).\n·       There can be a misconception that a baby bath seat is a safety product – this is not the case.\n·       Under no circumstances should parents regard bath seats as a safety aid and leave a child out of arms reach.\n·       RoSPA is aware of incidents where parents have been in the room, but away from the baby, with tragic results.\n·       RoSPA is aware of a number of drownings of young children in the bath where a baby bath seat has been used.\n·       There may be some bath seats that are less stable than others or that have inadequate methods to hold them in place."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

An ambulance was called but it took a number of hours until paramedics arrived and transported Mr Mason to hospital. Once there, Mr Mason was diagnosed with a fractured hip, as a result of the trauma suffered when he fell."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (numbered separately in respect of each organisation, who are required to respond to each of the numbered paragraphs relating to them):\n \nWorcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust (WAHT)\n1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing care to Mr Mason (in both the emergency department and the surgical trauma department) appreciated that, as someone who had Addison’s disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.\n \n2)       The relevant internal Trust guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure-based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules, which are on the same page as advice to patients and families for long-term condition management) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.\n \n3)       Evidence heard at the inquest (relating to the trauma/surgical department at WAHT) suggested that it is likely that many clinicians (including at consultant level) do not have a well-developed understanding of adrenal insufficiency and the crucial importance of administering replacement steroid therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of suffering an adrenal crisis.\n \n4)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that no prompts exist on emergency department/clerking documentation at WAHT for clinicians to check whether a patient suffers\nfrom adrenal insufficiency.  Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included.\n \nWest Midlands Ambulance Service University NHS Foundation Trust (WMAS)\n1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing pre-hospital care to Mr Mason appreciated that, as someone who had Addison’s disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.\n \n2)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical steroid treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. Currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not being considered by call-handlers at WMAS.\n \n3)       The Serious Incident investigation report disclosed by WMAS did not make any recommendations in respect of improving clinicians’ knowledge of adrenal insufficiency and the importance of considering administering replacement steroid therapy.\n \n4)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the investigation lead at WMAS had not been shown the inquest disclosure bundle, which had been disclosed to the legal department at WMAS a number of months prior to the inquest. This bundle contained relevant evidence from a different internal investigation (by WAHT), suggesting that the likely cause of Mr Mason’s deterioration and death was an acute adrenal crisis and not, as had been considered when a coronial referral had initially been made, hyperkalaemia and rhabdomyolysis (following a fall and long lie). This lack of internal co-ordination within WMAS prevented full internal investigation and learning in respect of the care given to Mr Mason by WMAS. The legal department of WMAS did not attend the inquest (it was their right not to) nor were WMAS legally represented by an external solicitor or barrister (it was their right not to be). Greater engagement and participation in the coronial investigation and inquest process would improve the Trust’s ability to learn from patient-safety incidents and enable the legal, governance and safety departments to better co-ordinate such investigations.\n \nAssociation of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE)\n1) The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) places very little emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis, owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the ‘administer hydrocortisone’ box) is itself a sub-section of an ‘emergencies in adults and children’ box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are ‘unwell’ require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis – it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered ‘unwell’ in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro- intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.\n \n2) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical medical treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. The pathway and programmed- logarithm should be looked at, as currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not able to be considered by ambulance service control centres.\n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\n1) The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. It is my understanding that a new guideline in respect of managing the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is currently being developed by NICE. Consideration of these matters should be included as part of guideline development.\n \nSociety for Endocrinology (Clinical Committee)\n1)       The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. The clinical committee of the Society for Endocrinology has previously been involved in providing guidance in respect of managing patients with adrenal insufficiency. The Society’s input going forward is important in respect of considering any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.\n \n2)       The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) place very\nlittle emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the ‘administer hydrocortisone’ box) is itself a sub-section of an ‘emergencies in adults and children’ box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation.

To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that some of the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered ‘unwell’ in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.  The Society’s input going forward is important in respect of considering  any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.\n \nNHS England\n1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately.

Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included.

Even though there was no surgical intervention, he was admitted under the care of the orthopaedic team. The orthopaedic team are not specialists in controlling medical problems associated with fractures. During the course of the admission, Mr. Stiff’s appetite was much reduced. He was not offered any nutritional supplements. On the 15 November 2022 he had reduced oxygen saturations and the medical team became involved in his care. He was diagnosed as suffering from a chest infection. He was treated with supplemental oxygen; intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics. Sadly, Mr. Stiff did not recover and he passed away at Queen’s Hospital on the 16 November 2022.

The inquest heard that this matter has been raised by the orthopaedic team on multiple occasions, but the orthogeriatric provision has not been increased.\n \nThe Inquest also heard that the lack of orthogeriatric provision is a national issue of concern within the NHS.\n \nOrthopaedic trauma in elderly patients often exacerbates underlying medical conditions.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. \n(1) On a Friday and Saturday night the Lowgate area of Hull city is exceptionally busy with people enjoying the night time economy. As such many are in drink. The area of Lowgate is open to traffic, it is also the location of a taxi rank. There is only one crossing facility (aside from at either end of the road), the road narrows significantly at one end.\n \n(2) Police raised concerns as follows:\n–          The road remaining open during a Friday and Saturday night.\n–          The number of pedestrians using the area.\n–          Many people in drink in the area having to cross the road.\n–          The road is a 30 mph.\n–          Lights of vehicles are distracting\n–          The location of the taxi rank, pedestrians having to navigate around the parked taxis, some with lights on, to enter the road. Taxis do 3 point turns in the road and any vehicle doing this is a danger to pedestrians.\n \n(3) Evidence was heard one doorman working in the area who stated “Having worked at the same location for some time, the area where the bars are on Lowgate is an accident waiting to happen. Members of the public are leaving the bars in a drunken state and they just wander into the road to cross, many of them not even looking for traffic on the road. Some vehicles travel down Lowgate far too fast given the evening activity” and another doorman stated “the road and both the footpaths at the location of the collision occurred on Lowgate are both very narrow. There is also a taxi rank outside O’Leary’s which doesn’t help as taxis were parked there at the time of the collision. I have seen numerous near misses over the years I have worked in the area. It is no exaggeration to say that there are between six to twelve incidents each night between cars and pedestrians, one thing which does not help and is also dangerous are taxis which do U turns in the road once they have collected their fare”.\n \n(4) The police had previously made recommendations and further felt that closing Lowgate to all through traffic on a Friday and Saturday evening, making Lowgate a total no stopping zone on an evening between certain hours, moving the location of a taxi rank onto nearby Alfred Gelder Street.\n \n(5) I note the statement from the local authority listed\n– They have erected 2 speed signs since the incident. Bearing in mind that this incident occurred with a vehicle travelling well within the limits, traffic is the concern not limited to the speed of vehicles.\n– The council was looking at developing a document that reviewed speed limits for the whole of the city centre. Lowgate has a special reason for being an area of concern and should be looked at as a priority and not in conjunction with all other city centre streets.\n– That engagement with the councils public transport department has commenced with the intention to relocate the taxi rank to Alfred Gelder street “but this requires consultation with the Hackney Carriage Association”. No indication was given regarding what was being done to facilitate this.\n– The council say that there are no resources to manage the road closure, despite acknowledging it is their responsibility. The fact the road is open at this time is a danger and I am concerned given the comments of the doormen that the danger is being underestimated.\n– Crossing facilities had been looked at but could not be positioned within a suitable distance.\n \n(6)  I am concerned that inappropriate weight has been given to the danger arising in this area and that without appropriate action further incidents will occur."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 2nd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rebecca Lisa KIRBY, aged 31 years.

She had recently been diagnosed with hypertension which was being treated with atenolol.

On the 13th January 2020 she was snorkelling using the full face mask when she expressed concerns and was accompanied back to the beach. She collapsed and died. \niv.) Expert evidence at the inquest identified immersion pulmonary oedema as the cause of the death. This is caused by the build-up of fluid in the lungs as a result of an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure caused by water pressure when the chest is submerged. This is exacerbated by hypertension and hormone replacement therapy. Negative pressure in the lungs causes fluid from the blood vessels to be drawn into the lungs. \nv.) The use of a full face snorkel mask contributed to the death in two ways: \na.) because negative pressure in the lungs is increased as a result of the increased effort of breathing caused by inhalation through the snorkel tube and mask, and \nb.) because respiratory effort is increased by the inhalation of elevated carbon dioxide levels caused by inhaling air drawn through a dead space in the mask.\nBoth exacerbate the negative pressure in the lungs and increase the effects of immersion pulmonary oedema."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

At the time that the Easybreath full face snorkel mask was developed by Decathlon there were no United Kingdom or European Standards which were applicable to a full face snorkelling mask.\niii.) In the course of its development, Decathlon commissioned a number of tests to be undertaken on it, but it was accepted in evidence that the tests undertaken did not replicate the conditions of the use of the mask by the general public.\niv.) Decathlon have sold over 16 million of the masks. Other such masks are also on the market.\nv.) The Decathlon usage instructions for the full face mask, contained in small print, have been amended over time. From the 17th August 2015 the instructions included a warning that you must make sure that you are in good physical condition before snorkelling and that the mask is not suitable for swimming.\nvi.) Further tests were undertaken and an Ergomedical report considered the issue of whether use of the mask and inhalation through the mask’s dead space gave rise to excess carbon dioxide inhalation. The report concluded “we strongly recommend to advise against wearing Easybreath masks to people who suffer from underlying cardio-respiratory conditions.”\nvii.) As a result, Decathlon amended their instructions for use to include that the mask should not be used if the user has unstable cardio-respiratory pathologies, that the mask is to be used under conditions of submaximal exercise (mild to moderate) and that it is not suitable for active swimming.\nviii.) Development of a United Kingdom standard in relation to this type of mask is now being put in train but has not yet begun and is likely to take some time.\nix.) Decathlon have recently updated their website in the United Kingdom to include the following, “It is not recommended to use this product if you have any ongoing respiratory or cardiovascular issues including but not limited to chest infection, asthma, high/raised blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease or angina etc. If you have any doubts or questions relating to this please check with your medical practitioner.” The same additional wording is being translated and added to all websites of the company.\nx.) The packaging of the mask has been revised to show a pictogram to warn against use of the mask by those with heart or other cardiovascular conditions.\nxi.) The concern is that many million of the full face masks have been sold and the safety concerns about their use by those with ongoing cardiovascular and respiratory issues has not been widely publicised or brought to the attention of those who already own the masks. Those purchased before 2017 had no warning is relation to these matters and the warning included in the instructions from 2017 inwards was not prominent nor sufficient to alert prospective purchasers to the hazards of use which have now been identified."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""Following an investigation opened on the 2nd March 2020 and an inquest opened on the 5th March 2020 the inquest was concluded on the 20th December 2022.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9th May 2023.

The other five deceased were all part of a party of five young Sri Lankan men who travelled together to Camber to enjoy a day at the beach on 24t of August 2016. They all went into the sea at a time when the tide had started to come in. It is not known how well any of them could swim. It is thought that they were all on a sand bar when they were overtaken and cut off by the incoming tide. All five bodies were recovered to the shore that day, or found after the tide had receded. The RNLI had recommended deploying lifeguards at the beach in 2013 but Rother District Council had not implemented that recommendation. It was accepted quite quickly after these deaths and lifeguards are now deployed. There was considerable evidence at the inquest on the question of whether that step, and others recommended, would have prevented any of the deaths.

At 4.06 am Mr Adams contacted the ambulance service to explain that he had fallen, injured his scalp and that he could not stop the bleeding. Mr Adams’ call was triaged using the Medical Priority Despatch System, which resulted in a disposition of 17-b-01: fall possible dangerous area. This translated to a category 3 ambulance response. The national target set by the Department of Health is to attend category 3 incidents within 120 minutes on at least 90% of occasions (so by 6.13 am), with an average response time of 60 minutes (by 5.13am). At the time of this call, Mr Adams appeared well with no additional symptoms. Mr Adams had also activated his careline, which is an element of the support provided by the housing association. At 7.53 an operator from the careline contacted Mr Adams to check on his welfare. Mr Adams reported that he was now feeling sick, that he was wobbly when stood up and that his bleeding was continuing. The careline operator contacted the ambulance service and advised of the new symptoms. A further triage was conducted, with the same disposition of fall, possibly dangerous area being reached, as the algorithm being used failed to account for the persistent nature of the bleeding being experienced and that Mr Adams was prescribed clopidogrel. At 10.25 Mr Adams again spoke to a careline operator. He was by now slurring his words and his speech was noticeably slow. It is likely he was experiencing symptoms associated with hypovolaemic shock. If Mr Adams had received treatment  by 10.25, he would have survived the injury he had sustained. The first ambulance resource arrived at Mr Adams’ property at 11.56, by which time a neighbour had found Mr Adams when Mr Adams had called for his help. Mr Adams was conveyed to Dorset County Hospital, where despite treatment he died on 19th October 2021."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:\ni. A patient, prescribed either antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, falling and sustaining a scalp laceration that is not “spurting or pouring blood” (the MPDS definition of “uncontrolled bleeding”), will never reach an MPDS disposition that results in a prioritisation higher than category 3, regardless of how long the bleeding has been persisting, unless the patient becomes unconscious or stops breathing. I heard evidence that the scalp is an area of high venous blood flow, such that a laceration to the scalp is capable of bleeding significantly. However, because of the nature of the blood supply in this area, the wound will not “spurt or pour” blood, so with the current iteration of MPDS a wound in this area of the body can never be considered as “serious haemorrhage”. Despite this, when assessing the seriousness of a bleed that does not meet the criteria for a “serious haemorrhage”, the MPDS algorithm does not allow for consideration of any delay in treatment or for the consideration of medications that may either exacerbate the extent of a bleed or prevent the blood from clotting to stop the bleed. For a patient such as Mr Adams, prescribed antiplatelet medication, there is a considerable risk that the bleeding will persist until the wound is closed, such that a delay in receiving treatment, where the wound continues to bleed, leaves the patient at risk of developing hypovolaemic shock."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 5th November 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Kenneth Michael Adams, born on the 2l5t August 1951.

Indeed, I am unclear that the processes are substantively different to those that existed at the time of Chloe’s death.\n \nIt was of very particular concern to hear that clinicians at the time were aware of revised national pregnancy guidance issued in September 2018 but this had not been incorporated into Trust policy and guidance. I was told that introducing revised guidance was necessarily complex and lengthy and yet the Trust did incorporate the revised guidance just several weeks following Chloe’s death and it appears because of her death. It was also very concerning to hear that the Trust had established a regional pregnancy service using out of date guidance. Certain changes relating to the circumstances of Chloe’s death have only very recently been addressed or are in process; for example, the procedure to call and respond to a major maternal haemorrhage was to be tested a week or two after the inquest.\n \nI therefore consider that the Trust should review its processes for identifying when Trust clinical policies and guidance needs updating, and where essential equipment needs to be obtained and located, in the interests of preventing future deaths, and that those processes should ensure timely revisions and associated actions."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 9 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rachael Chloe WALKER aged 36.

Sophie may have forgiven her for doing so, but the negative effect of those remarks remained.\n(4)  Although the Trust recognised “The risks of withdrawing the antipsychotic completely would be that Sophie would experience a deterioration in her symptoms:….an increase in paranoia,” it advised Sophie to stop her antipsychotic medication, which she had done by 12 May 2021.\n(5) The Trust did not conduct its own diagnosis of Sophie’s condition, or conditions. There was thus no check on whether Sophie did (in fact), have dissociative identity disorder, or dissociative amnesia (as was not suspected until after her death), and the treatment which the Trust did provide was determined accordingly.\n(6) The Trust did not carry out any, or any adequate, assessment of the ever­ present risk of overdose death posed to Sophie by the consequences of the psychotic and dissociative episodes, and by the other stress factors in her life, and thus did not actively consider, and hence did not take, steps to address that risk.\n(7)  The SCM provided by the Trust was, objectively, appropriate, in relation to certain aspects of the EUPD, but it was not adequate to, and did not, address that present and continuing short-term risk, which was also a\nrecognised aspect of it. Sophie herself did not find it helpful.\n(8)  The mental health practitioner who conducted the SCM sessions did not fulfil the function of the key-worker to which Sophie had become accustomed in Belfast, and whose support she had found helpful.\nThe announcement (made twice) by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust (“the GIC”) (that time which Sophie had spent waiting for treatment by the Brackenburg GIC in Belfast would not count towards her waiting-time. for the GIC) was “devastating” and left her “raging”.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \nMs Campbell had experienced a work-place related accident approximately 20 years prior to her death when she had fallen off a broken chair at work. She suffered with back pain, which became chronic, thereafter. She had a number of interventions including referral and attendance at pain clinics, manual therapy, CBT and pharmaceuticals.\nDuring her time with pain no clear cause was identified on MRI and other imaging. She was treated for chronic low back pain of indeterminate cause.\nOver the years she was treated with multiple, and escalating doses of, medications. These included at the time of her death, diazepam [REDACTED], amitriptyline [REDACTED], tramadol [REDACTED], gabapentin [REDACTED] and fentanyl patches [REDACTED] to be applied every 72 hours.\nShe was found collapsed at home in her bathroom and there was a possibility of a positional component to the respiratory depression consequent on the long-lie. The medical cause of death was given by the pathologist [REDACTED] as 1a Central Respiratory Depression 1b Tramadol excess with fentanyl II Long lie following a fall, chronic post traumatic back injury.\nThe police and paramedics attending the scene describe the finding of “hundreds” of packets of medications, some opened, some unopened.\nThis polypharmacy was identified by the pathologist who conducted the post mortem (taking from the toxicology report) as “In summary, excess Tramadol [REDACTED] and a metabolite [REDACTED] are indicative of recent moderately excessive ingestion prior to death. Although lower than levels typically seen in fatalities, the moderate excess in conjunction with other prescribed drugs, most notably fentanyl are sufficient to have produced central respiratory depression. No other significant post mortem findings were noted, and the prolonged lie following a fall may well have contributed a postural component to the respiratory depression”\nHer GP [REDACTED] gave clear and candid evidence. I accept the management of patients who describe intractable debilitating pain is challenging and difficult and that requests for other or increasing doses of medication can be difficult to resist. [REDACTED] agreed that the prescribing of the various drugs identified had potential to be dangerous. He told me that after a certain point the benefits of increasing or adding doses or medications in terms of pain relief were minimal. This scenario seems to be an invidious one for GP’s and patients alike.\n[REDACTED] told me that subsequent to Ms Campbell’s death the practice had convened and discussed the circumstances and agreed on regular reviews for patients taking these sorts of medication. There were no plans identified to actively look for these patients and to work to rationalize and / or reduce their medications.\nI am of the view that polypharmacy including gabapentinoids and opiates represents a severe safety risk in patients with a iatrogenic drug dependency. I consider that the risk in individuals like Ms Campbell of an inadvertent overdose of medications which have a cumulative and synergistic effect to depress the central nervous system can easily become extreme and lead to death. There have been a number of deaths in the Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire and Luton areas related to concomitant use of high dose and combination gabapentinoids and opioids."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 04 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Sharman CAMPBELL aged 56.

A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC’s regulation as the provision is not for “care” but support.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –\nChris was known to abscond from secure mental health detention during periods of “escorted leave”. He had left the care of the Trust on 6 occasions during his final 3 month detention and was known to purchase and take illicit drugs on these occasions. His Consultant had discussed this high risk behaviour with him on many occasions.\n \n(1) The Consultant Psychiatrist had signed the agreed escorted leave form on the basis that Chris would be accompanied 1:1 with a nurse. The purpose of the leave was therapeutic, to enable Chris to access the community in a supported manner. Evidence was before the court that the leave was only to the adjacent car park, to facilitate a smoking break, and 1 member of staff accompanied up to 6 patients. The Trust’s own Root Cause Analysis report confirms that the practise was at this time for 1 staff member to accompany those patients who wished to smoke to the adjacent carpark.\n \n(2) The car park is entirely unsecure and open to the road. Evidence given in court was that the hospital site is non-smoking, but the evidence was unclear whether the car park was considered to be part of the hospital site or separate.\n \n(3) My concern is that there has been a tolerated blurring of the boundaries between the intentions of escorted leave for individuals under a MHA section, and the ward staff’s ability to facilitate this in a meaningful and therapeutic way to benefit the patients, and that the clinical staff were not aware of this. Chris had indicated his desire to access the cash point and buy Christmas presents for his family, but there was no suggestion these requests had been considered by the Trust and either approved or refused. Chris therefore made the decision to leave the ward, with catastrophic consequences. Has the Trust given any consideration to the provision of a “safe” smoking area that patients can access without the need to be accompanied or to use their restricted escorted leave for this purpose alone?"",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 31 December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Thomas Ace RYAN.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –\n1.     Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;\n \n2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;\n \n3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;\n \n4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson.

However the management of theses strictures was complicated and there was no detailed national guidance on management of them and in particular when and how stenting should be approached. The development and implementation of detailed National Guidance was the inquest was told key to improving outcomes for patients such as Mrs Lomax across England;\n \n2.       Within Greater Manchester the inquest was told that the Christie were seeking to develop a specialist service for these complex cases but funding of a commissioned pan GM service was fundamental to a successful roll out that would benefit such patients as Mrs Lomax. The absence of such a service meant that cases such as Mrs Lomax’s could arise going forward given that in most hospitals even experienced radiologists/gastroenterologists would have limited experience on how to manage such cases;\n \n3.       The inquest also heard evidence that to support management of cases such as Mrs Lomax there was a regular GM Upper GI MDT led by Salford Royal Hospital. However staffing issues meant that there was not a regular presence for all Trusts at the meeting. This impacted effective communication and impacted patient care;\n \nThis was compounded by the fact that the inquest heard evidence that the MDT did not have a system of effective communication of agreed actions and recommendations for individual patients discussed at the MDT. As a consequence local clinicians were unsighted as to the recommended way forward.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)\n1. Emergency Response\n \nI heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency.\n \nAt the time of Samantha’s death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward.\n \nStaff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patient’s side.\n \nHowever, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patient’s side.\n \nI was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating.\n \nTo continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients’ side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths.\n \nThe delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient.\n \n2. Observation Policy\n \nAt the time of Samantha’s death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samantha’s death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing.\n \nEffective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient.\n \nInmind Healthcare Group’s new observation Policy states:\n \n‘Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice…….\nObservation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us’.\n \nSince Samantha’s death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour).\n \nEvidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice.\n \nHowever, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording.  This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were doing, the actual presentation of the patient was not being recorded."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 29 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Jane BOAZMAN aged 54.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n1.       The ELFT serious incident (SI) review report identified that, although Mr Largin was discharged to the Woodberry Wetlands neighbourhood rehabilitation team from the crisis (i.e. home treatment) team on 25 January 2022, the neighbourhood team did not allocate him to a team member until 3 February.\n2.       The report also identified that, despite receiving an email from the Homerton University Hospital community rehabilitation team on 2 February, saying that Mr Largin had been seen on 1 February and was still very depressed, the crisis team failed to reassess him or to re-open his case to the crisis team, but instead referred the community team to the neighbourhood team.\n3.       However, the SI report did not identify that the crisis team member who made the decision on 2 February simply to advise that Mr Largin should be dealt with by the neighbourhood team failed to record any reasons for her decision.\n4.       The SI reviewer giving evidence in court said that the SI reviewing team had not even spoken to that crisis team member as part of their investigation, let alone fed back to her.\n5.      He said they did not at the time realise that she still worked for ELFT, though he accepted that it would have been an extremely straight forward matter to find out. The crisis team member’s manager gave evidence that she thought the relevant decision maker had left the team before Mr Largin’s death, so between 3 and 6 February 2022. When I invited that manager to make a call while the inquest was ongoing to check, she later told me that the team member had not left the crisis team until 29 April 2022.\n6.    It is believed, I was told, that there was a hot de-brief after Mr Largin’s death. However, no notes were made of that and no entry was made on Mr Largin’s medical record.\n7.     Thus, nobody from ELFT found out what the decision maker’s thinking had been, or what misconceptions she might have had that other staff members might share. The former crisis team member who made the decision still works for ELFT. As far as I could ascertain, her decision making concerning Mr Largin has never been discussed with her by ELFT managers.\n8.     The SI review also did not identify that members of the crisis team and the neighbourhood team did not share an understanding of how quickly the neighbourhood team aims to make contact with patients, to assist in their decision making about the correct pathway for a patient. In fact, a member of the neighbourhood team itself gave evidence about the response times that, I was told later, was not correct.\n9.      Finally, the operations lead for the neighbourhood team had great difficulty in giving me clear evidence about whether his team would or could refer a patient back to the crisis team if they felt the circumstances warranted. He demonstrated a lack of clarity on the point that I found very concerning."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 10 February 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew Mark Largin, aged 60 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. \n  \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   \n1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. \n  \n1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  \n \n1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.\n \n1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.\n \n1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the ‘application’). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as “essential.”\n \n1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest. The application may well eliminate altogether the risk identified in the incident field."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 1 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John Holmes, aged 57.

Resuscitation algorithm (4 H’s & 4 T’s)* for PEA cardiac arrest\n I heard evidence that the 4 H’s and 4 T’s should be considered and excluded in any PEA cardiac arrest situation. Steps were taken to treat anaphylaxis, but in the absence of any improvement in Teegan’s clinical condition, and whilst it was mentioned, no steps were taken to exclude possible bilateral tension pneumothoraces. Evidence was heard at the Inquest that it is the only one of the 4 H’s and 4 T’s (see footnote) that directly results in a sudden inability to ventilate, with the HSIB report indicating that there was sufficient time to consider and exclude this possibility given the length of time of the PEA cardiac arrest.\n \n2. Surgical emphysem\nThere was a delay in the recognition of surgical emphysema by clinical attendees at the cardiac arrest (medical specialist registrar, consultant obstetricians, anaesthetic core trainee, anaesthetic specialist registrar and the on call consultant anaesthetist) despite indicative clinical signs of deep cyanosis, gross whole body swelling with the need to remove the increasingly constrictive hospital wrist band and endotracheal tube tie, alongside sub-cutaneous crepitus and an abdominal drainage bag noted to be tense with air.\n \n3. Investigation after Teegan’s death\nFollowing this incident, and despite Teegan being intubated and ventilated at the time, with a real possibility of this being an anaesthetic related event, no steps were taken by the anaesthetic department at St Richard’s Hospital, Chichester, either before or after the publication of the HSIB report, to explore potential iatrogenic or other anaesthetic related causes (such as exposure of Teegan’s lungs to excessive volume or pressure) as a possible or probable cause of Teegan’s death.\n \nFurthermore, the anaesthetic machine/ventilator was not taken out of service and assessed to see if there was a fault. Neither was the data from the anaesthetic machine downloaded and interrogated, which may have assisted in establishing how Teegan came to develop bilateral tension pneumothoraces during her emergence from general anaesthesia.\n \nThe failure of the anaesthetic department to undertake any morbidity or mortality review/meeting following Teegan’s death led to a lost opportunity to share any possible learning opportunities both within and outside their department to prevent future deaths, and as a corollary to have been in a position to fully assist both the investigation by the HSIB and the inquest hearing.\n \n4. Trust Clinical Governance procedures\nThe senior management team within the Trust have not acknowledged that there was a lack of a proper and robust system in place to trigger an investigation into all the circumstances of the death of a 17-year-old patient, with no steps taken by them to do so either before or after the publication of the HSIB report or at any time prior to the Inquest hearing.\n \nThis gives rise to a concern of a lack of insight within the senior management team of the importance of undertaking a comprehensive investigation into unexpected deaths within their organisation and for there to be wider dissemination of any institutional learning with the aim of preventing future deaths.\n \nThe failure of the Trust to fully investigate how Teegan came by her death also gives rise to a concern regarding the Trust’s obligation to comply with the Statutory Duty of Candour and their requirement to share their findings with both the regulators and Teegan’s family as well as to indicate the steps, if any, they have taken to prevent future deaths."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 7th January 2022 I resumed an investigation into the death of Teegan Marie Barnard.

Since that time, he had been under the care of the community mental health team with a period of care under the home treatment team in July 2021 following a short admission for a relapse in his condition. At his last review in September 2021, he was noted to be well but concern was expressed about lack of compliance with medication due to some side effects. On 02/12/21 he was noted by a resident at his shared accommodation to be hallucinating, having smashed a window and threated to eat the glass. Police and paramedics attended and he was taken to Good Hope Hospital emergency department where he arrived at 01.45. He was assessed by the mental health liaison service and a psychiatric doctor as needing a full Mental Health Act assessment which was undertaken at 11.30 on 03/12/21. The assessment concluded that he did require further treatment due to a relapse in his condition caused by non- compliance with his medication. He agreed to a voluntary admission, further assessment and recommencement of his medication. He remained in the Emergency department whilst attempts were made to find a bed. At the time there was a national shortage of mental health beds. Staff from the hospital notified the police that he had left the department at 13.41 and that he was at risk of harming himself. There was a failure to treat Mr Hamilton as a missing person at this time, a failure by the mental health services to refer him to the home treatment team for a safe and well check and he was not assessed by the street triage team. At 18.58 police were notified by his landlord that he had left his property following a mental health episode and he was reported to have drunk bleach. No action was taken in relation to this log. At 19.51 police found Mr Hamilton walking on the footpath alongside the dual carriageway near The Fort shopping village after a member of the public reported seeing a man walking in the road. Mr Hamilton reported to officers that he suffered from depression and was out walking to clear his head. Police noted that he was cold and wet and had recently been assessed at Good Hope Hospital and he agreed to be taken to Birmingham Heartlands hospital for further assessment. At the hospital he was triaged by a nurse and noted to be suicidal. He was taken to the escalation room to wait to be assessed. He was not seen again and was noted to be missing from the department at 05.28 on 05/12/21. It is not known when he left the department. There was a failure to report him missing at this time. On 06/12/21 the deceased was found by a member of the public who was walking his dog, in the middle of the river [REDACTED]  Stechford lying on his back on a rock. He was confirmed deceased at the scene by [REDACTED] at 12.20. His whereabouts since he left the emergency department on or around 4/5th December 2021 are unknown and whilst he had previously indicated suicidal ideation, his intentions at the time of his death are unknown. There were several failures in his care which amount to missed opportunities to help Mr Hamilton; however, it is not possible to say whether the outcome could have been different.\n \nFollowing a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be:\n1a Drowning 1b Psychosis"",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n1. (HEALTHCARE) Lack of safe system, supported by training, guidance, and compliance auditing, for the provision of physical healthcare assessment and monitoring by NEWS2 for acutely unwell patients in a secure setting.\n \nThe Jury found shortcomings in the healthcare afforded to Alex at HMP Nottingham in the form of “continuous failures to provide adequate healthcare, which probably more than minimally contributed to his death“.\n \nI heard evidence that staff were not consistently assessing acutely unwell patients using the NEWS2 system, despite the scoring system having been adopted across the NHS over the past decade and having been adopted by this Trust many years prior.\n \nIn 2017, when relaunching the NEWS system, the Royal College of Physicians noted,\n“Every so often, someone comes up with an idea that is so obvious, no one can understand why it wasn’t thought of before. I am proud that the RCP’s National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is one of those initiatives – not just a chart (or iPad) at the end of the bed to record the patient’s physical signs and symptoms, but the chart at the end of the bed – a single point of truth to unify recording of symptoms across the NHS, consolidate training for doctors and nurses in the recording of symptoms, and thereby improve patient safety. When the RCP launched the NEWS in 2012, we hoped to see the score adopted across the NHS. What has been more astonishing is the adoption of the score internationally, with requests to use NEWS coming from health services across the world from Europe to India and the USA, including the US Naval Air Forces!“\n \nI heard evidence of an inconsistent application of NEWS2 by staff, an inconsistent awareness of NEWS2 across the staff body, and an absence of clear and robust training supported by guidance, ensuring staff were aware of the expectations of their employer with regards to the use of NEWS2 in monitoring acutely unwell patients.\n \nSadly, Alex’s is not an isolated case. I have been repeatedly assured at a senior level from Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that they are seeking to embed NEWS2 across their Directorates, yet successive inquests have heard of patients failed by the lack of use of the system by the clinical staff responsible for their medical care. If this issue is not addressed across the Trust, with sufficient urgency, patients will continue to die in Trust settings due to a failure to recognise the\ndeteriorating patient, and to arrange for timely healthcare intervention."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 06 April 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Alexander Michael BRAUND, aged 25.  The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, conducted before a Jury, on 30 November 2022.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 14, 2023.
