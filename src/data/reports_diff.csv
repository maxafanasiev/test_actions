She took up residency on discharge from hospital where she had had an inpatient stay as a result of a fall in the community.\n \nOn becoming a resident of Ashley House Barbara had a known diagnosis of dementia, which sometimes affected her memory. She was at a high risk of falling and had blurred vision. All in all, she was a relatively frail elderly woman with known risks around her mobility and she relied on others to keep her safe.\n \nBarbara was the only resident with a bedroom on the first floor of Ashley House. This could only be accessed via the stairs (which Barbara was incapable of ascending or descending safely) or the mechanically operated stairlift (which Barbara was not permitted to use unattended or unsupervised.)\n \nOn the evening of the 8th of August 2022 two carers were on duty; neither of whom were native English speaking nationals; one was Romanian and the other was Indian.\n \nI was told that in order to be able to work in the UK, those requiring a Visa (as the two carers on duty did) must prove that they can read, write, speak and understand English to at least Level B1…. [that they must demonstrate that they] can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work”. Applicants for a Visa must have passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT).\n \nIt transpired during the Inquest that one of the workers on the evening of the 8th August 2022 had never passed the SELT, so was not qualified or permitted to work in the UK.\n \nAt 19:27 one of the carers called 999 to request an ambulance. It was clear, on the evidence, that Barbara had been left unattended on the mechanical chair for around five minutes. This was clearly contrary to the rules and procedures of Ashley House. During those five minutes she has left the seat of the mechanically operated stairlift (possibly unfastening the seat belt) and proceeded to climb the stairs; which she was unable to safely, due to do physical limitations and her underlying cognitive impairment.\n \nShe has fallen on the stairs, falling downwards. There were no witnesses to this incident but Barbara has been found, having fallen awkwardly, landing with her head trapped under the chair for the mechanically operated stairlift. Care staff were unable to free her because of the positioning and angle at which she was entrapped within the mechanics.\n \nOn calling 999 (copies of both recordings were played at the Inquest) it was obvious that neither of the care staff were sufficiently proficient in English to be able to:\nExplain clearly the nature of the medical emergency. An internal audit by the ambulance service revealed that the call-handler had selected an incorrect pathway. The correct pathway that should have been selected was “entrapment” but at no time during the call did the carer give any\ninformation that would have indicated that this was the presenting problem. The carer repeated used the word “blocked” which added no assistance, clarity of explanation of the events that were unfolding.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing”. This made any meaningful triage of Barbara’s condition virtually impossible. The call handler followed the script to ask if the patient was conscious and breathing (i.e. to ascertain clinical emergency and determination of a priority response) but this assessment was severely hampered given the carer did not appear to know or understand the difference between bleeding and breathing.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “alert” and “alive”, which presented all of the same problems as referred in in (ii) above.\n \nParamedics arrived on a category 2 response and, on arrival, it was clear that Barbara was beyond medical help. She was pronounced deceased at the scene.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

Vulnerable people, by very definition, are unable to often appreciate the need for help; take steps to keep themselves safe and/or summon help for themselves when they need it.\n \nBy being unable to speak the native language of England with any proficiency I am concerned that deaths will continue to arise where those who are young, disabled, suffering from a mental impairment or who are elderly and in need of urgent medical help will not have this summoned for them if those who are engaging with emergency professionals are unable to communicate effectively.\n \nThe Court looked at evidence of the B1 English test. Examples from the paper were as follows:\n“I                      that book last year” (options are bought, have bought, had bought)\n“The town,                  is very beautiful, has lots of parks” (options are which, where, what).\nThis level of comprehension is comparable to a KS2 curriculum being studied by Year 6 students sitting their SATS exam and appears to be wholly insufficient for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people, as demonstrated in this case by carers who were alone (i.e. no English speaking members of staff on duty) being unable to explain to medical professionals the presenting condition of the patient.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Jean Rymell, aged 91 (“Barbara”).

The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the\nreport until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022.

The lack of communication between these teams meant that timely sharing of results did not occur. Even the very knowledge of the fact that a CT scan had taken place would have alerted the endoscopist to check those results, and it is likely that the second endoscopy would not have gone ahead.

He had made a first call to the East of England Ambulance Service at around 7:29 pm on the 19th December 2022. The call was allocated a C2 category which aims to have an urgent response within an 18 minute time frame. The EEAS was extremely busy that night with previously unseen levels of C2 allocations of ambulances. In addition, the hospitals in the area were queuing ambulances outside ED’s because they were unable to offload patients and then proceed to other calls. That combination meant that despite being allocated an urgent response time Mr Vincent was effectively left on the floor for a very prolonged time. Ultimately he had a cardiac arrest at home and an ambulance attended promptly. He was resuscitated but the “down time” was prolonged. He died as a result of a combination of an undiagnosed bronchopneumonia complicated by severe coronary artery disease and a long lie.

There then followed a further ten hour delay, during which time he had a cardiac arrest, before he was admitted to the Emergency Department. He had been allocated an appropriate response time, expected within 18 minutes at 1929 on the 19th December 2022. For the reasons given in the circumstances above, that target was missed by an enormous margin.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\nWhilst the jury did not make any finding of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in this case, much evidence was heard about the training in identification of the signs and symptoms. National training of police officers on the identification of ABD is focused on a triad of warning flags being, hot to touch, exhibiting constant or near constant activity and extreme agitation or aggression. Some evidence identified that Carl Fullalove did not exhibit these triad symptoms but did exhibit other nuanced symptoms in the long list delivered in training. It was evident that his symptoms were not recognised as ABD due to drug intoxication, and that the consequential risks associated with prone restraint were not therefore considered. Prone restraint ultimately led to his death. There were six experts providing evidence to the inquest two of whom identified that Carl would not have died had he been recognised as unwell at the point of arrest and assessed by a health care practitioner. Such attention would have provided a calming intervention for his heart rate and breathing prior to being placed in prone restraint, which exerted additional pressure on his ability to breath freely.\n \nA research paper before the inquest, namely ‘Consensus on Acute Behavioural Disturbance in the UK, September 2023 recommends that the focus remain on the triad of warning signs. ABD is clearly difficult to distinguish from drug intoxication by a non-medical practitioner. The rigidity of the training with focus on specific symptoms can cause police officers to miss other signs. The Superintendent, and head of ‘Protecting Vulnerable People’ for Cheshire accepted that with hindsight the use of prone restraint was inadvisable in this case.\n \nSignificant training on ABD had been delivered by Cheshire Constabulary through the College of Policing Personal Safety Training package module, the key to which was to identify an underlying medical condition to refer to a health care practitioner. That may be a lot to expect of police officers in a dynamic fast paced setting. The use of the term ABD may be a distraction.\n \nThe effect of stimulant drugs and the need for calming de-escalation in an upright position, rather than prone restraint, had not been noted in either the training material or the research paper presented to the Court. This is on the background of recognising from College of Policing guidance that a high percentage of deaths in prone restraint are in drug related cases.\n \nThe First Aid Learning Programme (FALP) will be in place within Forces by April 2024 and includes amongst other things positional asphyxia, unconscious and not breathing, and ABD but does not mention training in calming intervention that on balance of probabilities may have led to a different outcome in this case.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 04 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carl FULLALOVE aged 29.

This in turn endangers patients, and creates a risk that people will die in the future as a result of such errors.\n \nIt is, sadly, very easy to envisage circumstances in which a patient might not receive essential medication at all, might receive the wrong dose of the medication they need, or might receive the wrong medication altogether, because of a transcription error.\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 31 October 2022 an investigation commenced into the death of Ms Cherry Lynne GARLAND, aged 77.

He did not simply arrive at hospital,  but   had been assessed and then sent there by his GP, who felt, rightly as it turned out, that Derek may have developed an obstruction. He was anticipating   Derek would be seen quickly.\n \n·      He arrived at the Emergency Department, and handed in some paperwork at reception and understandably expected he would not have to wait long to be assessed by doctors who he knew were expecting him.\n \n·      No-one called for him for almost two hours by which time he had died.\n \n·      It is correct to say that once a post mortem examination was performed, it was clear that even if he had been assessed immediately upon arrival at hospital his condition was such that surgical intervention was not a realistic possibility and the condition was going to prove terminal.\n \n·      At the time Derek arrived, as the Hospital Trust’s own internal review of this death explained, such were the pressures on the hospital Trust posed by patient numbers that it was operating at OPEL [Operations Pressure Escalation Level] 4. This is a method used by the NHS to measure the stress, demands, and pressure a hospital is under. OPEL 4 represents the highest level, when a hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient\nsafety is at risk”.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \n·      Concern 1 – that the medical professionals who work in a hospital emergency department are routinely expected to do so when the OPEL 4 applies, a recognition they are performing their roles when the hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient safety is at risk”. Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.\n \n·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for. There is a clear risk that puts patients at risk and it would be remiss of me not to raise it.\n \n·      Concern 3 – Finally, it is relevant to point out that Derek had not moved for    some time before a medical professional called for Derek.  I  formed the  view that there had been a reluctance on his Friend’s part to request assistance due   to the pressures staff were clearly under, but also because he had already  handed in Derek’s paperwork and was expecting some assistance imminently which did not arrive. I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""The death of Harold Derek PEDLEY Otherwise known as Derek PEDLEY on 21.12.22 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th August 2023.   ""},""action"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.""},""response"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

He was lifted from the floor and onto his bed by his family where he remained until an ambulance was called, when the decision was taken to admit him to the Royal United Hosptial (the RUH) in Bath.  \n \nHe was admitted via the Emergency department, then to the medical assessment unit (MAU), and then onto the Orthopaedic ward – Pierce Ward on 1st  June 2022 in the early hours.  \n \nAccording to the Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon, Mr Nippard was initially admitted, with the diagnosis of right knee septic arthritis and an acute kidney injury on top of his chronic kidney disease. Mr Nippard was on antibiotics and on 2nd   June 2022 underwent a washout of his knee. On 8th   June he had a second washout. By 17th   June he was deteriorating, on 20th   June his CRP was increasing. He said in his evidence that the pressure sore was first documented by the orthopaedic team on 21stJune, the surgeon described this now as – the bigger source of infection.  \n \nAn MRI was requested but did not take place for 4 days; it was undertaken on 25th June and reported as showing no obvious sacral osteomyelitis it did show that it had locally spread in the soft tissue.  \n \nBy 28th June Mr Nippard was getting worse, his inflammatory markers were going up and now his testicles were swollen, and there was a suspicion was that this was Fournier’s Gangrene and there was a referral made to the Urology team. \n   \nThe orthopaedic surgeon said that as far as the treatment for Mr Nippard’s knee went, he felt they were winning that it was improving that if he hadn’t developed the pressure sore his expectation was that he would have been discharged. He agreed with the medical cause of death proposed.  \n \nA Consultant Urologist examined Mr Nippard on 28th June, he said that he had evidence of a significant infection, that the only treatment was surgery, and all agreed that surgery was not likely to help, and it would cause Mr Nippard immense suffering in his last days. He explained that the other medical conditions Mr Nippard suffered with caused him to be compromised, if he’d had a stronger heart and kidneys then they would have operated \n \nSadly, after discussions with Urologists, Surgeons, Anesthetists and the Critical care team it was decided that Mr Nippard was not fit for surgery, and he was placed on priorities of care and died on 6th   July 2022. \n \nIt was the view of the doctors who attended the inquest and gave evidence that the pressure sore significantly contributed to Mr Nippard’s death.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

On the 19 December 2022 he was stepped down from intensive care to a ward.

The reason for refusal is unclear and there is no documented evidence that the risk of non-compliance with the medication was explained to him or escalated to the medical team.

That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.\n \n7.  Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.\n \n8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.\n \n9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.\n \n10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.\n \nThe summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021 [REDACTED].\n \nThe investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.\n \nI made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:\n \n1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n \n2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.\n \n3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.\n \n4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.\n \n5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.\n \n6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.\n \n7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.\n \n8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.\n \n9.  At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward.

He had suffered from hypoxic brain damage and died at Ashford Hospital, Kent on the 28th of July. The other five deceased were all part of a party of five young Sri Lankan men who travelled together to Camber to enjoy a day at the beach on 24t of August 2016. They all went into the sea at a time when the tide had started to come in. It is not known how well any of them could swim. It is thought that they were all on a sand bar when they were overtaken and cut off by the incoming tide. All five bodies were recovered to the shore that day, or found after the tide had receded. The RNLI had recommended deploying lifeguards at the beach in 2013 but Rother District Council had not implemented that recommendation. It was accepted quite quickly after these deaths and lifeguards are now deployed. There was considerable evidence at the inquest on the question of whether that step, and others recommended, would have prevented any of the deaths. It should be noted that the length of the beach from which people can swim is about three miles and the distance between high water mark and low water mark is as much as a kilometre in some tides.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Although the 2 relevant Councils were duty bound to house both individuals up until the age of 21 under the Leaving Care Act, there is currently no regulation for the over 18’s.

A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC’s regulation as the provision is not for “care” but support. The provision is made from an entirely un-regulated sector, resulting in some organisations offering accommodation with inadequate training, staffing or knowledge to meet the complex needs of some of our most vulnerable individuals.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nConsideration should be given to the review of the treatment, monitoring and management of patients with a history of epilepsy or seizures by both the prison staff and healthcare staff. In particular, there was no seizure care plan, no seizure diary and once the ACCT had closed on 10th March 2021, there was no formal mechanism of monitoring Trevor’s condition. Further, the ACCT is not a suitable mechanism for such monitoring. The CSRA policy is designed to protect other prisoners, but not those who suffer from medical conditions as Trevor suffered. PPG in their evidence to be considered relating to PFD matters state that a care plan dashboard is now in place at HMP Lewes but this does not appear to be individualized or tailored to the prisoner’s clinical requirements.\n \nCommunication between healthcare and prison staff especially when Trevor was returned to the wing, between the prison staff and family, briefing by prison managers to officers on the wing about Trevor’s condition were all inadequate.\n \nEvidence was heard about the lack of integration of various IT systems which contributed to poor communication. In spite of the evidence from PPG regarding the sensitivity of medical records which should not be disclosed to the prison staff, I remain concerned that there was no effective monitoring and management of Trevor on the wing once the ACCT was closed. There was no mechanism in place for prison and healthcare staff to report their concerns about Trevor’s non compliance with taking his medication to Security, thus preventing the cell from being searched for retained medication.\n \nThere was a lack of training of prison staff in dealing with long term health conditions such as epilepsy on the wings.

From 23 July she began to reach out to other professional colleagues (she had been a counsellor herself) via text message and email and made desperate pleas for help, to such an extent that one of these professionals called the police. On 26 July she recorded a video message for her daughter and left a handwritten note for her husband and daughter. She took sleeping tablets and appeared to have drunk some wine as well.

One of the recommendations made by the investigation panel was:\n \n“Children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should be suspected of having a pleural effusion and should get an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”\n \nThat recommendation reflected advice provided on 29th November 2022 (the day after Iona’s admission to Northampton General Hospital) by the East Midlands Paediatric Critical Care Network:\n \n“We would like to inform you of a high number of cases of highly aggressive sepsis, linked to empyema, and positive culture for Group A Streptococcus in the region. This has caused significant morbidity and mortality.\nWe advise early referral, aggressive management, high dose intravenous antibiotics, and early drainage of empyemas.\nPlease have a low threshold for investigating any child with a secondary respiratory deterioration, especially with new onset of fever. Chest X-Ray and ultrasound will be beneficial.”\n \nAt the inquest into Iona’s death, I heard evidence from the Trust’s Clinical Director of the Child Health Directorate who is also a Consultant Paediatrician.\n \nOn the basis of the evidence I heard from the Clinical Director, I am satisfied that the Trust has taken action in respect of the recommendations made and more broadly have reflected upon the circumstances of Iona’s death. However, in respect of the recommendation set out above, I am concerned that there remains a risk that future deaths could occur unless further action is taken.\n \nThe recommendation made by the investigation panel was that children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should get “an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”. However, the evidence I heard suggests this is not possible.\n \nI heard from the Clinical Director that as a district general hospital, Northampton General Hospital does not have access to a paediatric radiologist outside of 9am-5pm on Mondays and Fridays when such a specialist is either on duty or on-call. I heard evidence that in Iona’s case, a Consultant in ITU and Anaesthesia was able to perform an ultrasound scan at around 2pm on 4th December 2022 however this is not a facility that would routinely be available to the Trust and was not, in any event, part of that clinician’s core duties.\n \nI am concerned that a very unwell child who may require a chest ultrasound may not receive one ‘immediately’ and in fact may have to wait for a considerable period of time.

Tammy was assessed as being at high and ongoing risk of ingesting foreign objects, a risk which had materialised on many occasions prior to her death, and often lead to hospital admission. Her risk of self-harm by ingestion led to the lawful use of mechanical restraints, comprising of mittens, a bio belt, eyesight or arm’s length observations, controlled and supervised access to items when spending time out of her mittens, and a total restriction on Tammy having free access to personal items. On 22 March 2021, hospital staff provided Tammy was a twistable crayon to use while her mittens were removed. The twistable crayon had not been risk assessed or approved for use by Tammy’s MDT, who were responsible for setting her care plan. In those circumstances, the twistable crayon ought not to have been provided to her. If the crayon had been presented to the MDT, her Consultant Psychiatrist would not have approved its use as it would have posed an obvious risk of serious harm if ingested due to its size and plastic structure. Instead, alternative child-safe small wax crayons could have been used to meet the same therapeutic purpose. At this time, the Trust did not have any documented system that set out the requirements for the MDT to approve the use of risk items, but this was nevertheless an expectation on the MDT, which they failed to complete. There is no clear or consistent record of who was observing Tammy or what items she had been granted access to on 22 March 2021. Despite the crayon being noted as “missing” from the pack, no incident report was completed, nor was the Security Manager alerted or any ward level plan initiated to seek to locate the risk item. Tammy started to present with symptoms of a complication of swallowing the item the next day. She reported nausea after eating, vomiting and epigastric tenderness. Mental health staff escalated her symptoms to the physical healthcare team. Tammy reported to the Advanced Clinical Practitioner that she could feel the twistable crayon inside her. The ACP made a plan to monitor for any deterioration and to discuss with the GP the following day. She was not escalated for investigations at the local hospital despite the size of the missing item and Tammy reporting feeling it inside her.\nThe Trust failed to have in place a formal policy relating to the management of the ingestion of foreign bodies. This meant that staff were not all working to a clear plan of how to monitor for, detect and respond to the medical complications of ingesting foreign bodies. The MDT failed to have in place a care plan specific to Tammy’s risk of swallowing, setting out how this should be managed and escalated by ward staff. There was no continuing, co-ordinated investigation to seek to locate the twistable crayon. On the evening of 16th May 2021 Tammy was observed to be vomiting in her toilet and at the same time reaching into the toilet. When asked, Tammy reported that she had swallowed a toothbrush. An out of grounds visit was arranged to take Tammy to Bassetlaw District General hospital. Tammy was examined at Bassetlaw General Hospital and was given an x-ray at 01:33am on 17th May 2021 which did not reveal any foreign bodies. Tammy was booked for an ultrasound scan later that day but was discharged at approximately 9:30am and returned to Rampton Hospital before this could be completed.\nStaff seem to have taken the negative x-ray result as evidence that there were no foreign bodies in Tammy’s system. Many staff were unaware of the limitations of x-ray in relation to non-radiopaque items or the extent of the imaging.\nOn the evening of 4th June 2021 Tammy reported discomfort and anxiety due to constipation. Given the timing and symptoms we feel this is likely to be the beginning of Tammy’s deterioration. No actions beyond further observations are recorded to have taken place, staff appear to have taken Tammy’s constipation entirely at face value. There is no evidence that the twistable crayon was being considered at this point.\nTammy spent most of the day of 5th June 2021 in bed due to worsening symptoms. It is recorded that a mechanical restraint review was undertaken by the duty doctor, but it is unclear whether any physical examination of Tammy was undertaken at this point.\nBy the evening of 5th June Tammy’s temperature and heart rate had begun to spike and mental health staff became concerned. The same duty doctor was contacted during the evening by ward staff as Tammy continued to deteriorate. The duty doctor did not attend the ward or examine Tammy and advised ward staff to provide Tammy with paracetamol. This represents a missed opportunity to have recognised the deteriorating patient and to have sought medical attention.\nThere is no record at this point that Tammy’s symptoms were linked in any way to foreign body ingestion, despite Tammy voicing concern that she may have perforated her bowel. Tammy’s symptoms continued to worsen throughout the early hours of 6th June 2021, including high pulse rate and temperature, anxiety, abdominal pain and vomiting, escalating to projectile vomiting and apparent ‘faecal’ vomit.\nThe Hospital Trust failed to adhere to the NEWS2 Policy when Tammy was acutely unwell. NEWS2 was not recorded as frequently as required, at times the readings were incomplete, and the total score was not acted upon in accordance with the policy. This led to an underestimation of Tammy’s clinical risk, and multiple missed opportunities to have rendered care in an acute hospital which would probably have prevented her death\nThe physical healthcare team and the on-call Duty Doctor failed to recognise Tammy was a deteriorating patient and failed to take steps to arrange her timely transfer to an acute hospital for treatment of her perforated bowel.\nOver the weekend of 5-6 June 2021 there was a breakdown in communication between the ward staff, physical healthcare staff, duty doctor, and site management as to Tammy’s signs and symptoms which led to a delay in her being transported to hospital to receive treatment for her condition\nTammy continued to deteriorate throughout the morning of 6th June 2021, until shortly after 2pm when Tammy’s symptoms were recognised by the physical healthcare team to be so severe that an ambulance would be required to take Tammy to hospital. A number of miscommunications between staff, added to the lack of a clear escalation protocol for staff to follow, resulted in a delay to the ambulance being called, because staff were unclear who should call the medical emergency."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest I heard evidence giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nPoor Quality Acute Physical Healthcare in the mental health setting\nTammy’s death demonstrates a further example of a failure by medical staff to recognise a deteriorating patient and a subsequent delay in escalating for acute secondary care intervention.\nHer death comes after repeated concerns have been raised about the quality of the Trust’s physical healthcare service in secure settings since 2018 (when Angus Bowie died from sepsis due to a perforation), in 2019 (when Christopher Howard Smith died from a pulmonary embolus), in 2020 (when Alexander Braund died from a chest infection) and in 2021 (when Michelle Louise Whitehead died from Hyponatraemic Encephalopathy).\nAt each of those inquests, the Trust committed to improving the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings and yet the same poor quality has prevailed in Tammy’s care.\nThese are examples of preventable deaths and the similarity in themes across them is exceptionally worrying.\nAction needs to be taken at the most senior level to effect meaningful change to the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings at which the Trust provides services, recognising this class of patients as exceptionally vulnerable to deterioration as they are unable, either through mental health challenges and/or incarceration, to access healthcare services of their own volition.\n \nFailure to Adhere to the National and Local National Early Warning Score (version 2) Policy\nThis is a repeated theme identified at inquest and in previous Prevention of Future Death reports. Staff remained unclear at the inquest about how frequently vital signs ought to be taken, where and how to record the values, and what action should be taken depending on the score.\n \nA lack of robust policy relating to Ingestion of Foreign Bodies\nI heard evidence that the Trust is in the process of drafting a policy, but it became clear during evidence that the policy is not yet sufficiently robust.\nThe policy needs to cover the assessment of risk when access is permitted to risk items, where such a risk assessment is stored and who is responsible for its review of content, what to do when ingestion is\nsuspected including how this should be managed medically and what security measures need to be taken to locate the item.\n \n4. Emergency Medical Calls\nThere was significant confusion in this case as to who should call a medical emergency and how information should be relayed to the ambulance service. It had been recognised early in the day by the Security Team that Tammy may require an out of grounds medical transfer, but it was not until much later in the afternoon, when Tammy was in cardiac arrest, that an ambulance was called. The Security Team expected the physical healthcare team to place the call, the physical healthcare team expected the ward to place the call due to proximity to the patient.\nEvidence called at the inquest established continued confusion amongst staff as to how an emergency should be managed.\n \nThis appears to be a training issue."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 13 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Tammy Mary Louise WATKINS, aged 36, which concluded by inquest held before me sitting with a Jury between 9 and 20 October 2023.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 March 2024.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nThere was evidence that staff at Conway House were significantly concerned for Mr Cork’s welfare, which is why he was deemed as ‘at risk’. As a result of being ‘at risk’ I was told that welfare checks were required to be undertaken, at least every 24 hours. Such checks required a staff member to physically see and interact with Mr Cork or, in the alternative, to telephone him and speak to him. Welfare checks were then required to be recorded on a spreadsheet. Despite this, I was told in evidence that welfare checks would only be recorded if the resident in question was actually ‘seen’ by the staff member undertaking the check; this raises the concern that there is disparity about what constitutes a welfare check and what will or will not be recorded.\n \nI heard evidence that prior to Mr Cork being found unresponsive in his room on 22 May 2023, the last recorded welfare check for Mr Cork was during the early shift of Saturday 20 May 2023. The concern here is that Mr Cork, despite being required to have welfare checks at least once every 24 hours, was not properly checked upon for between 36- 48 hours prior to his death.\n \nA night project worker at Conway House told me in evidence that they had opened Mr Cork’s door at about 20:35 on Sunday 21 May 2023, but did not enter the room to see or assess Mr Cork. The only reason for opening the door appears to have been the arrival of the ‘EMS team’ who were required to check that Mr Cork was at home for the purposes of conditions imposed by the criminal justice system.\n \nHaving heard what they believed to be snoring, the staff member closed the door and left. This fact was verified by Metropolitan Police Officers who checked CCTV footage as part of their initial investigation following Mr Cork’s death. The concern here is that staff made assumptions that the ‘snoring’ noise was coming from Cork’s room and not an adjoining room, and that the noise was snoring, without investigating further. This was a missed opportunity to properly check on Mr Cork’s welfare, as required.\n \nIn evidence, I was taken through the spreadsheet that is used to record all checks and/or welfare checks required for any residents of Conway House. The record system appears to have been a basic Microsoft Excel spreadsheet devised by staff. I was told that the computer and/or spreadsheet often ‘crashed’, which led to data sometimes not being able to be recorded. I also observed that some fields of the spreadsheet were often left blank. Staff undertaking and recording checks regularly appeared not to input their name(s) or the time at which checks were undertaken. I was also told that while there was some training on how to undertake and record welfare checks, this was not needed because it was a simple task.\n \nThe concern here is that the recording system for welfare checks may not be adequate and that the approach taken to filling in the data required on the spreadsheet varied from one staff member to another, which may also indicate that there is a training need.\n \nI was told in evidence that the same spreadsheet is still used to record any checks and/or welfare checks required for residents. I was told that the issues identified with a lack of checks for Mr Cork were caused by the fact that there were a significant number of agency staff on duty and that Conway House no longer uses agency staff. However, the staff member that opened Mr Cork’s door at 20:35 (without entering the room or seeing Mr Cork) on 21 May 2023 and subsequently found him unresponsive on the morning of 22 May 2023 was a substantive member of staff.\n \nI was not reassured that any proper investigation into these issues had been undertaken or that any action(s) required to bring about improvements in the system of undertaking and recording welfare checks have been identified and/or implemented."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 15 June 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of NICHOLAS CORK, then aged 57 years.

He was advised that the additional cost of histological analysis of the excised samples would be c.£65 and so decided not to have the samples sent for analysis. When the lesion continued to trouble him in May 2020, he returned to his GP who referred him to dermatology, where a further excision was performed and analysed and was found to be melanoma. An ultrasound scan showed that the melanoma had metastisised to his lymph nodes, chest wall and lungs. Despite immunotherapy and targeted oral therapy, the melanoma continued to metastasise and in June 2022, scans showed that it had spread to Gregor’s brain such that his condition was terminal.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nI was not able to conclude that, had the sample been sent for analysis in March 2019, any sign of melanoma would have been detected. Nevertheless, it is of concern that the barrier to undergoing a complete procedure, including histological analysis, appears to be one of cost. Anecdotal evidence received at inquest from treating clinicians was that the further costs associated with histological or other review, which on the NHS would be routinely included within the procedure at no charge to the patient, was a common disincentive to patients who would regularly opt not to have the further tests carried out.\nWhile it is acknowledged that there have to be criteria for routine and non-emergency procedures to be conducted on the NHS, my concern relates to the disparity in what is included within the treatment when undertaken privately (where histological analysis is a separate and additional cost) and what is routinely included as part of NHS treatment\nIt therefore seems to me that there is a risk of future deaths if patients not meeting the NHS referral criteria, who have to pay for procedures to be carried out privately, opt on cost grounds not to have the histological analysis which would otherwise be provided on the NHS at no charge, as it is well-established fact that earlier detection and treatment is crucial in minimising the risks of developing metastatic cancers including melanoma."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 29 July 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Gregor Patrick Edward Lynn aged 24 years.

There was no clear cause or diagnosis for the seizures but it was felt that he was suffering from electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. In November 2022 a decision was made to commence him on high dose steroids, a known consequence of which was immunosuppression. He developed signs of chicken pox on Friday 17 February 2023 and was brought to his community paediatric appointment on 20 February 2023 but not seen and assessed as he was known to have a contagious disease. He was seen later that day by a nurse at his general practitioner surgery and was seen and sent home. A later discussion between a general practitioner at the surgery and the community paediatrician led to a referral to the paediatric assessment unit at Ipswich hospital. The unit was busy and an appointment was not made until the following morning. By 11am on 21 February 2023 Nuel had deteriorated further and his parents had to support and carry him to the paediatric assessment unit arriving at 11.05am. Observations taken at 11.30am revealed he was pyrexial, tachycardic and tachypnoeic but the sepsis pathway was not followed. He was prescribed paracetamol at 12.15 and seen by a paediatric registrar who did not consider the sepsis protocol should be initiated as there was a clear cause for his symptoms i.e chicken pox. The plan was made to observe him, recheck his observations and if he had improved to send him home with oral Acyclovir. At 13.20 he remained pyrexial and tachycardic and his respiratory rate was still high at 32 and he was prescribed Ibuprofen. By 15.30 his temperature had come down and his heart rate had settled but was still high at 118, as was his respiratory rate at 29. He was also unable to mobilise having previously not being limited with his mobility. He was confused but this was considered to be his usual presentation due to his neurodegenerative condition. The doctor who planned to discharge him did not discuss him with a Consultant and was not aware he needed a wheelchair to leave hospital having had no issues with his mobility prior to the onset of his current viral illness.\nHe was taken home by his parents and was unable to swallow his oral medication and took very little by way of fluids. He deteriorated the following day and collapsed shortly before 2pm. His parents called emergency services and police and paramedics attended. Despite attempts at resuscitation including in the emergency department at West Suffolk hospital he died later that afternoon. A post mortem revealed he had died as a consequence of Varicella Zoster."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Ian fell so that he landed in front of the toilet block in the car park, suffering very serious injuries. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted at the scene by lifeguards and off duty doctors, before being conveyed to RCHT by ambulance. Ian was examined at hospital and found to have sustained multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs.\n \nOn 4 June 2022, Ian was transferred to Derriford Hospital for treatment of complex spinal fractures, under the neurosurgical team.\n \nOn 5 June 2022 Ian suffered a medical episode which developed into a critical incident in which Ian deteriorated rapidly and required life saving measures.\n \nOn 6 June 2022 Ian was taken to theatre for spinal surgery. Before surgery, the critical care flexible endotracheal tube was replaced by an armoured tube. After surgery, the anaesthetic team commenced an airway exchange, namely removing the armoured tube which had been inserted for the operation, in order to replace it with the more flexible critical care tube. However, having removed the armoured tube, the team were unable to insert the flexible tube despite repeated attempts. Ian then started to desaturate due to lack of oxygen. The Consultant Anaesthetist proceeded to jet ventilate Ian, the first jet was uneventful, the second resulted in massive neck swelling, Ian went into cardiac arrest. The medical team then resorted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency tracheostomy. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 20-25 minutes During this time Ian suffered hypoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen.\n \nOver the following days, Ian suffered seizures on the intensive care unit and an MRI on 9 June 2022 showed extensive changes consistent with hypoxic brain injury.\n \nOn 15 June 2022, Ian’s care was transitioned to end–of-life care.\n \nIan died in the intensive care unit at Derriford hospital at 17:10 on 15 June 2022."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nThere was an error of omission in record keeping and in handover from critical care to surgery, and that this error likely contributed to Ian’s death.\nThere was no entry in Ian’s hospital notes to indicate the full extent of the critical incident of 5 June 2022.\nThere was a lack of information on handover from critical care to the surgical team regarding the full extent of the critical incident of the 5 June 2022. There was a verbal handover which was brief and vague. There was no formal written handover process highlighting significant events.\nThe error of omission was unexplained and has not been investigated by the NHS. The evidence regarding the error of omission came to light after the completion of the NHS investigation into Ian’s death. The Consultant Anaesthetist involved in Ian’s operation discovered the fact of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 on a later examination of ventilator data. The data indicated that Ian deteriorated significantly, that he was close to a cardiac arrest and the critical care team saved his life.\nThe surgical and anaesthetic team had no reason to suspect a secondary brain injury. The team had no information on Ian’s neurological status. Ian is likely to have suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the critical incident of 5th June. This will have undermined his resilience and ability to physically withstand the rigors of spinal surgery and airway exchange.\nHad the surgical and anaesthetic team known of the extent of the critical incident of 5 June, the operation would have been delayed and further tests and assessments undertaken. The anaesthetic team may have opted for elective tracheostomy if the full circumstances of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 had been known. An elective tracheostomy would have led to\na different outcome because it would have avoided the complications that ensued from the attempted airway exchange.\nI note the NHS Investigator and the Investigatory Panel both recommended that action is required for the handover of complex patients. The panel recommended as follows:\nMore robust and formalised handover of complex patients before transfer to theatre, to include review of airway management, cardiopulmonary status, potential avenues of deterioration and any significant events during admission\nThe Trust had chosen not to accept this recommendation but at the time the Trust made that decision it was not aware of the extent and significance of the error of omission."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 7 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of 51 year old Ian Jacka.

An incision made from the insular and intended to find the temporal horn was made at the wrong trajectory. Prior to that incision it is probable that her head position, previously fixed, had moved, a matter of which the surgeon remained unaware. The incision made was excessively deep and caused significant damage to Tracy’s brain. Two further attempts were made at different trajectories to locate the temporal horn with the last utilising a neuro-navigation system to assist. Both were excessively deep. On being woken from the anaesthetic it was immediately apparent that Tracy had sustained serious brain injury. She died in hospital on the 19th of November 2016. On the balance of probability, it is likely that Tracy would have died as a result of the damage caused by the first incision.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 19th of December 2023.

The expert and the Trust’s own Head of Midwifery advised that this was not appropriate. It therefore does not appear that the learning has been passed on to all Trust Midwives and there is a risk that in future cases those treating the baby will be falsely reassured by normal cord pH results which may not be accurate.\n \nWhile I read evidence of some training that had been provided in response to HSIB recommendations for further training on auscultation in addition to saturation monitoring and ECG monitoring during resuscitation, the independent expert also recommended training on UVC and IO access. I am also concerned that there does not appear to have been training in relation to the provision of blood transfusions in such cases to ensure that all potential reversible causes are treated before resuscitation stops.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –\n1.     Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;\n \n2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;\n \n3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;\n \n4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. \n  \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   \n1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. \n  \n1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  \n \n1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.\n \n1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.\n \n1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the ‘application’). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as “essential.”\n \n1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest. The application may well eliminate altogether the risk identified in the incident field."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 1 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John Holmes, aged 57.

Resuscitation algorithm (4 H’s & 4 T’s)* for PEA cardiac arrest\n I heard evidence that the 4 H’s and 4 T’s should be considered and excluded in any PEA cardiac arrest situation. Steps were taken to treat anaphylaxis, but in the absence of any improvement in Teegan’s clinical condition, and whilst it was mentioned, no steps were taken to exclude possible bilateral tension pneumothoraces. Evidence was heard at the Inquest that it is the only one of the 4 H’s and 4 T’s (see footnote) that directly results in a sudden inability to ventilate, with the HSIB report indicating that there was sufficient time to consider and exclude this possibility given the length of time of the PEA cardiac arrest.\n \n2. Surgical emphysem\nThere was a delay in the recognition of surgical emphysema by clinical attendees at the cardiac arrest (medical specialist registrar, consultant obstetricians, anaesthetic core trainee, anaesthetic specialist registrar and the on call consultant anaesthetist) despite indicative clinical signs of deep cyanosis, gross whole body swelling with the need to remove the increasingly constrictive hospital wrist band and endotracheal tube tie, alongside sub-cutaneous crepitus and an abdominal drainage bag noted to be tense with air.\n \n3. Investigation after Teegan’s death\nFollowing this incident, and despite Teegan being intubated and ventilated at the time, with a real possibility of this being an anaesthetic related event, no steps were taken by the anaesthetic department at St Richard’s Hospital, Chichester, either before or after the publication of the HSIB report, to explore potential iatrogenic or other anaesthetic related causes (such as exposure of Teegan’s lungs to excessive volume or pressure) as a possible or probable cause of Teegan’s death.\n \nFurthermore, the anaesthetic machine/ventilator was not taken out of service and assessed to see if there was a fault. Neither was the data from the anaesthetic machine downloaded and interrogated, which may have assisted in establishing how Teegan came to develop bilateral tension pneumothoraces during her emergence from general anaesthesia.\n \nThe failure of the anaesthetic department to undertake any morbidity or mortality review/meeting following Teegan’s death led to a lost opportunity to share any possible learning opportunities both within and outside their department to prevent future deaths, and as a corollary to have been in a position to fully assist both the investigation by the HSIB and the inquest hearing.\n \n4. Trust Clinical Governance procedures\nThe senior management team within the Trust have not acknowledged that there was a lack of a proper and robust system in place to trigger an investigation into all the circumstances of the death of a 17-year-old patient, with no steps taken by them to do so either before or after the publication of the HSIB report or at any time prior to the Inquest hearing.\n \nThis gives rise to a concern of a lack of insight within the senior management team of the importance of undertaking a comprehensive investigation into unexpected deaths within their organisation and for there to be wider dissemination of any institutional learning with the aim of preventing future deaths.\n \nThe failure of the Trust to fully investigate how Teegan came by her death also gives rise to a concern regarding the Trust’s obligation to comply with the Statutory Duty of Candour and their requirement to share their findings with both the regulators and Teegan’s family as well as to indicate the steps, if any, they have taken to prevent future deaths."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 7th January 2022 I resumed an investigation into the death of Teegan Marie Barnard.
