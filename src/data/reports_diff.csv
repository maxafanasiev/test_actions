In particular, there was no seizure care plan, no seizure diary and once the ACCT had closed on 10th March 2021, there was no formal mechanism of monitoring Trevor’s condition. Further, the ACCT is not a suitable mechanism for such monitoring. The CSRA policy is designed to protect other prisoners, but not those who suffer from medical conditions as Trevor suffered. PPG in their evidence to be considered relating to PFD matters state that a care plan dashboard is now in place at HMP Lewes but this does not appear to be individualized or tailored to the prisoner’s clinical requirements.\n \nCommunication between healthcare and prison staff especially when Trevor was returned to the wing, between the prison staff and family, briefing by prison managers to officers on the wing about Trevor’s condition were all inadequate.\n \nEvidence was heard about the lack of integration of various IT systems which contributed to poor communication. In spite of the evidence from PPG regarding the sensitivity of medical records which should not be disclosed to the prison staff, I remain concerned that there was no effective monitoring and management of Trevor on the wing once the ACCT was closed. There was no mechanism in place for prison and healthcare staff to report their concerns about Trevor’s non compliance with taking his medication to Security, thus preventing the cell from being searched for retained medication.\n \nThere was a lack of training of prison staff in dealing with long term health conditions such as epilepsy on the wings.

She saw her GP on 16 and 30 June, and on 30 June she was referred to the Crisis Response Team. On both 5 and 8 July, she left a note for her family and took a taxi to a train station and multi-storey car park respectively.

From 10 July she received specialist in-patient care at the Peter Bruff Unit, before being discharged home on 17 July under the care of the Crisis Home Treatment Team, who attended upon her either in person or virtually until 25 July. From 23 July she began to reach out to other professional colleagues (she had been a counsellor herself) via text message and email and made desperate pleas for help, to such an extent that one of these professionals called the police. On 26 July she recorded a video message for her daughter and left a handwritten note for her husband and daughter. She took sleeping tablets and appeared to have drunk some wine as well. When her husband returned home that evening, he found her hanging [REDACTED]. A post-mortem examination confirmed the medical cause of death to be; 1a Hanging.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nFollowing Iona’s death, the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust conducted a Serious Incident Investigation. One of the recommendations made by the investigation panel was:\n \n“Children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should be suspected of having a pleural effusion and should get an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”\n \nThat recommendation reflected advice provided on 29th November 2022 (the day after Iona’s admission to Northampton General Hospital) by the East Midlands Paediatric Critical Care Network:\n \n“We would like to inform you of a high number of cases of highly aggressive sepsis, linked to empyema, and positive culture for Group A Streptococcus in the region. This has caused significant morbidity and mortality.\nWe advise early referral, aggressive management, high dose intravenous antibiotics, and early drainage of empyemas.\nPlease have a low threshold for investigating any child with a secondary respiratory deterioration, especially with new onset of fever. Chest X-Ray and ultrasound will be beneficial.”\n \nAt the inquest into Iona’s death, I heard evidence from the Trust’s Clinical Director of the Child Health Directorate who is also a Consultant Paediatrician.\n \nOn the basis of the evidence I heard from the Clinical Director, I am satisfied that the Trust has taken action in respect of the recommendations made and more broadly have reflected upon the circumstances of Iona’s death. However, in respect of the recommendation set out above, I am concerned that there remains a risk that future deaths could occur unless further action is taken.\n \nThe recommendation made by the investigation panel was that children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should get “an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”. However, the evidence I heard suggests this is not possible.\n \nI heard from the Clinical Director that as a district general hospital, Northampton General Hospital does not have access to a paediatric radiologist outside of 9am-5pm on Mondays and Fridays when such a specialist is either on duty or on-call. I heard evidence that in Iona’s case, a Consultant in ITU and Anaesthesia was able to perform an ultrasound scan at around 2pm on 4th December 2022 however this is not a facility that would routinely be available to the Trust and was not, in any event, part of that clinician’s core duties.\n \nI am concerned that a very unwell child who may require a chest ultrasound may not receive one ‘immediately’ and in fact may have to wait for a considerable period of time. For example, if the need arose over a weekend, that child may not receive an ultrasound scan for up to 48 hours.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 14th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Iona Grace Buckingham, aged 9 months.

Tammy was assessed as being at high and ongoing risk of ingesting foreign objects, a risk which had materialised on many occasions prior to her death, and often lead to hospital admission. Her risk of self-harm by ingestion led to the lawful use of mechanical restraints, comprising of mittens, a bio belt, eyesight or arm’s length observations, controlled and supervised access to items when spending time out of her mittens, and a total restriction on Tammy having free access to personal items. On 22 March 2021, hospital staff provided Tammy was a twistable crayon to use while her mittens were removed. The twistable crayon had not been risk assessed or approved for use by Tammy’s MDT, who were responsible for setting her care plan. In those circumstances, the twistable crayon ought not to have been provided to her. If the crayon had been presented to the MDT, her Consultant Psychiatrist would not have approved its use as it would have posed an obvious risk of serious harm if ingested due to its size and plastic structure. Instead, alternative child-safe small wax crayons could have been used to meet the same therapeutic purpose. At this time, the Trust did not have any documented system that set out the requirements for the MDT to approve the use of risk items, but this was nevertheless an expectation on the MDT, which they failed to complete. There is no clear or consistent record of who was observing Tammy or what items she had been granted access to on 22 March 2021. Despite the crayon being noted as “missing” from the pack, no incident report was completed, nor was the Security Manager alerted or any ward level plan initiated to seek to locate the risk item. Tammy started to present with symptoms of a complication of swallowing the item the next day. She reported nausea after eating, vomiting and epigastric tenderness. Mental health staff escalated her symptoms to the physical healthcare team. Tammy reported to the Advanced Clinical Practitioner that she could feel the twistable crayon inside her. The ACP made a plan to monitor for any deterioration and to discuss with the GP the following day. She was not escalated for investigations at the local hospital despite the size of the missing item and Tammy reporting feeling it inside her.\nThe Trust failed to have in place a formal policy relating to the management of the ingestion of foreign bodies. This meant that staff were not all working to a clear plan of how to monitor for, detect and respond to the medical complications of ingesting foreign bodies. The MDT failed to have in place a care plan specific to Tammy’s risk of swallowing, setting out how this should be managed and escalated by ward staff. There was no continuing, co-ordinated investigation to seek to locate the twistable crayon. On the evening of 16th May 2021 Tammy was observed to be vomiting in her toilet and at the same time reaching into the toilet. When asked, Tammy reported that she had swallowed a toothbrush. An out of grounds visit was arranged to take Tammy to Bassetlaw District General hospital. Tammy was examined at Bassetlaw General Hospital and was given an x-ray at 01:33am on 17th May 2021 which did not reveal any foreign bodies. Tammy was booked for an ultrasound scan later that day but was discharged at approximately 9:30am and returned to Rampton Hospital before this could be completed.\nStaff seem to have taken the negative x-ray result as evidence that there were no foreign bodies in Tammy’s system. Many staff were unaware of the limitations of x-ray in relation to non-radiopaque items or the extent of the imaging.\nOn the evening of 4th June 2021 Tammy reported discomfort and anxiety due to constipation. Given the timing and symptoms we feel this is likely to be the beginning of Tammy’s deterioration. No actions beyond further observations are recorded to have taken place, staff appear to have taken Tammy’s constipation entirely at face value. There is no evidence that the twistable crayon was being considered at this point.\nTammy spent most of the day of 5th June 2021 in bed due to worsening symptoms. It is recorded that a mechanical restraint review was undertaken by the duty doctor, but it is unclear whether any physical examination of Tammy was undertaken at this point.\nBy the evening of 5th June Tammy’s temperature and heart rate had begun to spike and mental health staff became concerned. The same duty doctor was contacted during the evening by ward staff as Tammy continued to deteriorate. The duty doctor did not attend the ward or examine Tammy and advised ward staff to provide Tammy with paracetamol. This represents a missed opportunity to have recognised the deteriorating patient and to have sought medical attention.\nThere is no record at this point that Tammy’s symptoms were linked in any way to foreign body ingestion, despite Tammy voicing concern that she may have perforated her bowel. Tammy’s symptoms continued to worsen throughout the early hours of 6th June 2021, including high pulse rate and temperature, anxiety, abdominal pain and vomiting, escalating to projectile vomiting and apparent ‘faecal’ vomit.\nThe Hospital Trust failed to adhere to the NEWS2 Policy when Tammy was acutely unwell. NEWS2 was not recorded as frequently as required, at times the readings were incomplete, and the total score was not acted upon in accordance with the policy. This led to an underestimation of Tammy’s clinical risk, and multiple missed opportunities to have rendered care in an acute hospital which would probably have prevented her death\nThe physical healthcare team and the on-call Duty Doctor failed to recognise Tammy was a deteriorating patient and failed to take steps to arrange her timely transfer to an acute hospital for treatment of her perforated bowel.\nOver the weekend of 5-6 June 2021 there was a breakdown in communication between the ward staff, physical healthcare staff, duty doctor, and site management as to Tammy’s signs and symptoms which led to a delay in her being transported to hospital to receive treatment for her condition\nTammy continued to deteriorate throughout the morning of 6th June 2021, until shortly after 2pm when Tammy’s symptoms were recognised by the physical healthcare team to be so severe that an ambulance would be required to take Tammy to hospital. A number of miscommunications between staff, added to the lack of a clear escalation protocol for staff to follow, resulted in a delay to the ambulance being called, because staff were unclear who should call the medical emergency.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest I heard evidence giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nPoor Quality Acute Physical Healthcare in the mental health setting\nTammy’s death demonstrates a further example of a failure by medical staff to recognise a deteriorating patient and a subsequent delay in escalating for acute secondary care intervention.\nHer death comes after repeated concerns have been raised about the quality of the Trust’s physical healthcare service in secure settings since 2018 (when Angus Bowie died from sepsis due to a perforation), in 2019 (when Christopher Howard Smith died from a pulmonary embolus), in 2020 (when Alexander Braund died from a chest infection) and in 2021 (when Michelle Louise Whitehead died from Hyponatraemic Encephalopathy).\nAt each of those inquests, the Trust committed to improving the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings and yet the same poor quality has prevailed in Tammy’s care.\nThese are examples of preventable deaths and the similarity in themes across them is exceptionally worrying.\nAction needs to be taken at the most senior level to effect meaningful change to the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings at which the Trust provides services, recognising this class of patients as exceptionally vulnerable to deterioration as they are unable, either through mental health challenges and/or incarceration, to access healthcare services of their own volition.\n \nFailure to Adhere to the National and Local National Early Warning Score (version 2) Policy\nThis is a repeated theme identified at inquest and in previous Prevention of Future Death reports. Staff remained unclear at the inquest about how frequently vital signs ought to be taken, where and how to record the values, and what action should be taken depending on the score.\n \nA lack of robust policy relating to Ingestion of Foreign Bodies\nI heard evidence that the Trust is in the process of drafting a policy, but it became clear during evidence that the policy is not yet sufficiently robust.\nThe policy needs to cover the assessment of risk when access is permitted to risk items, where such a risk assessment is stored and who is responsible for its review of content, what to do when ingestion is\nsuspected including how this should be managed medically and what security measures need to be taken to locate the item.\n \n4. Emergency Medical Calls\nThere was significant confusion in this case as to who should call a medical emergency and how information should be relayed to the ambulance service. It had been recognised early in the day by the Security Team that Tammy may require an out of grounds medical transfer, but it was not until much later in the afternoon, when Tammy was in cardiac arrest, that an ambulance was called. The Security Team expected the physical healthcare team to place the call, the physical healthcare team expected the ward to place the call due to proximity to the patient.\nEvidence called at the inquest established continued confusion amongst staff as to how an emergency should be managed.\n \nThis appears to be a training issue.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 13 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Tammy Mary Louise WATKINS, aged 36, which concluded by inquest held before me sitting with a Jury between 9 and 20 October 2023.   ""},""action"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.""},""response"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 March 2024.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n \nThere was evidence that staff at Conway House were significantly concerned for Mr Cork’s welfare, which is why he was deemed as ‘at risk’. As a result of being ‘at risk’ I was told that welfare checks were required to be undertaken, at least every 24 hours. Such checks required a staff member to physically see and interact with Mr Cork or, in the alternative, to telephone him and speak to him. Welfare checks were then required to be recorded on a spreadsheet. Despite this, I was told in evidence that welfare checks would only be recorded if the resident in question was actually ‘seen’ by the staff member undertaking the check; this raises the concern that there is disparity about what constitutes a welfare check and what will or will not be recorded.\n \nI heard evidence that prior to Mr Cork being found unresponsive in his room on 22 May 2023, the last recorded welfare check for Mr Cork was during the early shift of Saturday 20 May 2023. The concern here is that Mr Cork, despite being required to have welfare checks at least once every 24 hours, was not properly checked upon for between 36- 48 hours prior to his death.\n \nA night project worker at Conway House told me in evidence that they had opened Mr Cork’s door at about 20:35 on Sunday 21 May 2023, but did not enter the room to see or assess Mr Cork. The only reason for opening the door appears to have been the arrival of the ‘EMS team’ who were required to check that Mr Cork was at home for the purposes of conditions imposed by the criminal justice system.\n \nHaving heard what they believed to be snoring, the staff member closed the door and left. This fact was verified by Metropolitan Police Officers who checked CCTV footage as part of their initial investigation following Mr Cork’s death. The concern here is that staff made assumptions that the ‘snoring’ noise was coming from Cork’s room and not an adjoining room, and that the noise was snoring, without investigating further. This was a missed opportunity to properly check on Mr Cork’s welfare, as required.\n \nIn evidence, I was taken through the spreadsheet that is used to record all checks and/or welfare checks required for any residents of Conway House. The record system appears to have been a basic Microsoft Excel spreadsheet devised by staff. I was told that the computer and/or spreadsheet often ‘crashed’, which led to data sometimes not being able to be recorded. I also observed that some fields of the spreadsheet were often left blank. Staff undertaking and recording checks regularly appeared not to input their name(s) or the time at which checks were undertaken. I was also told that while there was some training on how to undertake and record welfare checks, this was not needed because it was a simple task.\n \nThe concern here is that the recording system for welfare checks may not be adequate and that the approach taken to filling in the data required on the spreadsheet varied from one staff member to another, which may also indicate that there is a training need.\n \nI was told in evidence that the same spreadsheet is still used to record any checks and/or welfare checks required for residents. I was told that the issues identified with a lack of checks for Mr Cork were caused by the fact that there were a significant number of agency staff on duty and that Conway House no longer uses agency staff. However, the staff member that opened Mr Cork’s door at 20:35 (without entering the room or seeing Mr Cork) on 21 May 2023 and subsequently found him unresponsive on the morning of 22 May 2023 was a substantive member of staff.\n \nI was not reassured that any proper investigation into these issues had been undertaken or that any action(s) required to bring about improvements in the system of undertaking and recording welfare checks have been identified and/or implemented.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 15 June 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of NICHOLAS CORK, then aged 57 years.

When the lesion continued to trouble him in May 2020, he returned to his GP who referred him to dermatology, where a further excision was performed and analysed and was found to be melanoma. An ultrasound scan showed that the melanoma had metastisised to his lymph nodes, chest wall and lungs. Despite immunotherapy and targeted oral therapy, the melanoma continued to metastasise and in June 2022, scans showed that it had spread to Gregor’s brain such that his condition was terminal.

Nevertheless, it is of concern that the barrier to undergoing a complete procedure, including histological analysis, appears to be one of cost. Anecdotal evidence received at inquest from treating clinicians was that the further costs associated with histological or other review, which on the NHS would be routinely included within the procedure at no charge to the patient, was a common disincentive to patients who would regularly opt not to have the further tests carried out.\nWhile it is acknowledged that there have to be criteria for routine and non-emergency procedures to be conducted on the NHS, my concern relates to the disparity in what is included within the treatment when undertaken privately (where histological analysis is a separate and additional cost) and what is routinely included as part of NHS treatment\nIt therefore seems to me that there is a risk of future deaths if patients not meeting the NHS referral criteria, who have to pay for procedures to be carried out privately, opt on cost grounds not to have the histological analysis which would otherwise be provided on the NHS at no charge, as it is well-established fact that earlier detection and treatment is crucial in minimising the risks of developing metastatic cancers including melanoma.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 29 July 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Gregor Patrick Edward Lynn aged 24 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nA thematic review completed in November 2021 had identified a number of significant issues in the functioning of mental health services, and many of the same issues were also identified in the serious incident review into Linda’s care and treatment, from February 2022 until her death. It is apparent that any actions taken as a result of the thematic review were not effective in implementing change and that the action plan was still a “work in progress” at the Pre Hearing Review Hearings which took place in this case in 2023.\nThe Serious Incident Investigation into the care received by Linda was not completed until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after the death. This is neither timely nor responsive. Despite reassurances given that the Trust are working to eradicate such delays, in response to a series of previous PFD reports issued by the Coroners of Durham and Darlington, there are still cases coming to the attention of the Coronial service where Serious Incident Investigations are significantly delayed in excess of the 60 day NHS framework.\nAs previously reported the concern in relation to the delays in such investigations and any subsequent necessary action required, is twofold. Firstly, the quality of the investigation is severely compromised as the evidence is not captured when memories are fresh. Secondly, because any lessons to be learnt and improvements to be made to improve patient safety cannot be implemented promptly.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On the 19th of April 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Linda Louise Banks, aged 48 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18th of December 2023. The medical cause of death was 1a) Paracetamol overdose with alcohol misuse. I gave a narrative conclusion as follows:-\n \nLinda Louise Banks died on the 10th of April 2022 at the University Hospital of North Durham. Linda had a history of alcohol misuse and mental health difficulties, including self harm and suicidal ideation. Linda also had learning difficulties which may have increased her vulnerability, which were not identified by vast majority of the mental health professionals, and there is no evidence that consideration was given to any reasonable adjustments that might be necessary, or as to any impact such may have had on her presentation, communication and understanding.\n \nLinda herself, her family and her friends, made multiple contacts with mental health services between February 2022 and her death, as her mental health deteriorated and concerns were expressed as to her safety. Referrals were also made by two external agencies, namely her GP and a home support agency, both expressing concerns about Linda’s presentation. On each occasion risks were considered to be minimal and no further treatment or care was provided by mental health services.\n \nThere were a multiplicity of difficulties revealed by a serious incident review which was extensively delayed and not received until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after Linda’s death. It concludes that Linda did not receive the right care at the right time and her needs were not fully met, and included concerns, in summary, in relation to the quality of assessments and triage, quality of safety planning, poor record keeping, and further considers that there was an underestimation of risk and a lack of a trauma informed approach. I also find that these difficulties culminated in advice being given to a friend attempting to support Linda and communicated to her family, from an unknown mental health worker, that they should consider “tough love” and to effectively step back from their intensive support of Linda, thus removing an essential safety net in the absence of any ongoing mental health treatment or support. The identified failings cumulatively contributed to the death more than minimally.\n \nAn earlier thematic review which had been completed in November 2021 identified many similar serious issues in the provision of mental health services, to those identified in this case, and it is clear that many of these issues were continuing at the time of Linda’s death in April of 2022 and had not been addressed effectively by the Trust.\n \nOn the 9th April 2022 Police forced entry to Linda’s home, as a result of concerns raised by her family and friends and was taken to hospital by ambulance. She was hyperthermic and had low blood sugar and had taken an overdose of medication.

There was no clear cause or diagnosis for the seizures but it was felt that he was suffering from electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep. In November 2022 a decision was made to commence him on high dose steroids, a known consequence of which was immunosuppression. He developed signs of chicken pox on Friday 17 February 2023 and was brought to his community paediatric appointment on 20 February 2023 but not seen and assessed as he was known to have a contagious disease. He was seen later that day by a nurse at his general practitioner surgery and was seen and sent home. A later discussion between a general practitioner at the surgery and the community paediatrician led to a referral to the paediatric assessment unit at Ipswich hospital. The unit was busy and an appointment was not made until the following morning. By 11am on 21 February 2023 Nuel had deteriorated further and his parents had to support and carry him to the paediatric assessment unit arriving at 11.05am. Observations taken at 11.30am revealed he was pyrexial, tachycardic and tachypnoeic but the sepsis pathway was not followed. He was prescribed paracetamol at 12.15 and seen by a paediatric registrar who did not consider the sepsis protocol should be initiated as there was a clear cause for his symptoms i.e chicken pox. The plan was made to observe him, recheck his observations and if he had improved to send him home with oral Acyclovir. At 13.20 he remained pyrexial and tachycardic and his respiratory rate was still high at 32 and he was prescribed Ibuprofen. By 15.30 his temperature had come down and his heart rate had settled but was still high at 118, as was his respiratory rate at 29. He was also unable to mobilise having previously not being limited with his mobility. He was confused but this was considered to be his usual presentation due to his neurodegenerative condition. The doctor who planned to discharge him did not discuss him with a Consultant and was not aware he needed a wheelchair to leave hospital having had no issues with his mobility prior to the onset of his current viral illness.\nHe was taken home by his parents and was unable to swallow his oral medication and took very little by way of fluids. He deteriorated the following day and collapsed shortly before 2pm. His parents called emergency services and police and paramedics attended. Despite attempts at resuscitation including in the emergency department at West Suffolk hospital he died later that afternoon. A post mortem revealed he had died as a consequence of Varicella Zoster.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Ian fell so that he landed in front of the toilet block in the car park, suffering very serious injuries. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was conducted at the scene by lifeguards and off duty doctors, before being conveyed to RCHT by ambulance. Ian was examined at hospital and found to have sustained multiple fractures to his skull, spine and ribs.\n \nOn 4 June 2022, Ian was transferred to Derriford Hospital for treatment of complex spinal fractures, under the neurosurgical team.\n \nOn 5 June 2022 Ian suffered a medical episode which developed into a critical incident in which Ian deteriorated rapidly and required life saving measures.\n \nOn 6 June 2022 Ian was taken to theatre for spinal surgery. Before surgery, the critical care flexible endotracheal tube was replaced by an armoured tube. After surgery, the anaesthetic team commenced an airway exchange, namely removing the armoured tube which had been inserted for the operation, in order to replace it with the more flexible critical care tube. However, having removed the armoured tube, the team were unable to insert the flexible tube despite repeated attempts. Ian then started to desaturate due to lack of oxygen. The Consultant Anaesthetist proceeded to jet ventilate Ian, the first jet was uneventful, the second resulted in massive neck swelling, Ian went into cardiac arrest. The medical team then resorted to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and an emergency tracheostomy. Return of spontaneous circulation occurred after 20-25 minutes During this time Ian suffered hypoxic brain injury from lack of oxygen.\n \nOver the following days, Ian suffered seizures on the intensive care unit and an MRI on 9 June 2022 showed extensive changes consistent with hypoxic brain injury.\n \nOn 15 June 2022, Ian’s care was transitioned to end–of-life care.\n \nIan died in the intensive care unit at Derriford hospital at 17:10 on 15 June 2022.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nThere was an error of omission in record keeping and in handover from critical care to surgery, and that this error likely contributed to Ian’s death.\nThere was no entry in Ian’s hospital notes to indicate the full extent of the critical incident of 5 June 2022.\nThere was a lack of information on handover from critical care to the surgical team regarding the full extent of the critical incident of the 5 June 2022. There was a verbal handover which was brief and vague. There was no formal written handover process highlighting significant events.\nThe error of omission was unexplained and has not been investigated by the NHS. The evidence regarding the error of omission came to light after the completion of the NHS investigation into Ian’s death. The Consultant Anaesthetist involved in Ian’s operation discovered the fact of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 on a later examination of ventilator data. The data indicated that Ian deteriorated significantly, that he was close to a cardiac arrest and the critical care team saved his life.\nThe surgical and anaesthetic team had no reason to suspect a secondary brain injury. The team had no information on Ian’s neurological status. Ian is likely to have suffered a hypoxic brain injury during the critical incident of 5th June. This will have undermined his resilience and ability to physically withstand the rigors of spinal surgery and airway exchange.\nHad the surgical and anaesthetic team known of the extent of the critical incident of 5 June, the operation would have been delayed and further tests and assessments undertaken. The anaesthetic team may have opted for elective tracheostomy if the full circumstances of the critical incident of 5 June 2022 had been known. An elective tracheostomy would have led to\na different outcome because it would have avoided the complications that ensued from the attempted airway exchange.\nI note the NHS Investigator and the Investigatory Panel both recommended that action is required for the handover of complex patients. The panel recommended as follows:\nMore robust and formalised handover of complex patients before transfer to theatre, to include review of airway management, cardiopulmonary status, potential avenues of deterioration and any significant events during admission\nThe Trust had chosen not to accept this recommendation but at the time the Trust made that decision it was not aware of the extent and significance of the error of omission.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 7 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of 51 year old Ian Jacka.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n(1)  The Liaison and Diversion of Lancashire and South Cumbria NHS Foundation Trust had contact with Mr Goodwin in September and October 2022. Liaison and Diversion Team members visited Mr Goodwin at home and concluded that he was at risk of self- neglect. They noted his appearance, his living conditions and the fact that he was not taking prescribed medication. On any view Mr Goodwin was vulnerable: he suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia, and was thought to misuse alcohol. The Liaison and Diversion Team considered that there were safeguarding concerns in respect of Mr Goodwin and referred him to the Adult Social Care team of Cumbria Council. I understand that the team in question now forms part of Westmorland and Furness Council. Despite this referral from practitioners who had personally visited Mr Goodwin, it was rejected at triage on 5th October 2022. I am concerned that this indicates that an approach to triage is being taken which pays insufficient regard to the concerns of practitioners who had personally witnessed apparent safeguarding concerns.\n \n(2)  The witness statement on behalf of the Adult Social Care team explains that after the refusal to conduct a safeguarding enquiry, Mr Goodwin was nevertheless referred for the Social Work team to ‘engage’ with him. A social worker took steps to engage with Mr Goodwin and his family and concluded that a care assessment was appropriate. Despite\nthis the ‘Reablement Team’ referred the case for closure indicating that they did not consider that such an assessment was not required. I am concerned that this indicates further circumstances in which the needs of a vulnerable person might be overlooked. After a social worker considered that a care assessment was needed the Reablement Team appear to be able to come to an alternative view and close the case without further discussion or rationale. In another case this might lead to a vulnerable person being disregarded.\n \n(3)  Fortunately, the Closure Team noticed that the Reablement Team were seeking to close a case in which another social worker had recommended a Care Assessment. They sent the case to the ‘Short Term Allocation Tray’. This should have resulted in a referral but that did not happen. I am concerned that in a future case a referral might not be generated and a person’s needs overlooked. The witness statement prepared by the Service Manager indicated ‘we are looking at a way of ensuring that notifications requiring an action are only acknowledged once the task is complete’. This indicates that such work has not yet borne fruit and the risk still exists.\n \n(4)  Thereafter Mr Goodwin’s case was allocated and de-allocated to a social worker within the space of one day, without anything being done. It is said that there is no note or explanation for this. I am concerned that, once again, the ability of a case to be allocated and deallocated within a short period and without anything having been done may enable a case to ‘fall through the cracks’. Indeed, the referral for the care assessment was not ultimately actioned until 25th November 2022, 2 weeks after Mr Goodwin died.\n \n(5)  More generally, it is striking how many different teams and systems appear to co-exist and require mutual communication and cross referencing. I am concerned that the above narrative demonstrates that those systems do not function effectively. I am concerned that this exposes other vulnerable adults to risk.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On    16    November    2022 I    commenced    an    investigation    into    the    death      of Gerald GOODWIN.

He underwent an emergency laparotomy the same day with findings of a pelvic abscess from a perforated gangrenous appendix and non-viable adjacent colonic tissue and small bowel obstruction. This required drainage of the abscess, removal of the gangrenous tissue and bowel and formulation of a stoma. As part of the pre-surgical preparations for post operative care the placement of a central venous catheter (CVC) was undertaken using the right subclavian vein. A landmark approach was used. There was no use of ultrasound to assist placement of the CVC despite this being available. As part of the checks to ensure correct placement of the CVC a check chest x-ray was undertaken. Other checks in the form of an arterial blood gas and transducing the intra-vessel pressure wave via the CVC were not undertaken even though the necessary equipment to do so was available. The check chest x-ray was incorrectly interpreted as showing correct placement into the vein whereas, in fact, the CVC had been incorrectly placed into the artery.

A CT scan undertaken showed evidence of a subarachnoid haemorrhage that had occurred previously around 28th March 2023. The scan was incorrectly reported as being clear. At Tameside General Hospital her consciousness levels were reduced, and she was agitated. She had probably developed a severe vasospasm from the subarachnoid haemorrhage. Treatment options at this point are extremely limited. An MRI scan on 5th April 2023 showed multi territorial infarctions and significant narrowing of all the intracranial vessels.

He applied for indefinite leave to remain in 2004 but this was rejected in the same year.\n2.        He had a history of severe mental health issues.\n3.        Mr Santos was remanded to HMP Highdown on 29 October 2019, being transferred to HMP Belmarsh on 26 November 2019. On 6 May 2020, Mr Santos was sentenced to two years’ imprisonment and was due to be released on 27 October 2020.\n4.        On 5 October 2020, the Immigration Service served an IS91 notice of a decision to detain on Mr Santos. This meant he would not be released from prison at the end of his sentence whilst his deportation was considered. A Stage 1 letter had been served on 28 December 2018 but a Stage 2 letter had not been served. There was also an outstanding appeal in the First-tier immigration Tribunal.\n5.        Mr Santos wrote a letter on a bail form outlining his concerns about returning to Brazil, referring to his sexuality and his health. This was sent by the prison to a charity assisting immigration detainees on 29 October 2020.\n6.        In the early hours of 2 November 2020, the night officer found Mr Santos hanging in his cell during a routine check. Staff tried to resuscitate him. Ambulance staff arrived. Mr Santos was declared dead at 3.30am.\n \nIn summary, the jury found as follows:\n \n·       That Mr Santos’ understanding of his immigration position at the conclusion of his custodial sentence made a material contribution to his death.\n·       There was a failure to notify Mr Santos of the incoming IS91 form and its significance.\n·       The central issue was communication between Mr Santos and the various agencies involved with him. By 16 October 2020 Mr Santos understood he would be detained at the end of his sentence but was confident his bail application would lead to resolution. However in the days prior to his death he told a fellow prisoner he believed he was to be placed in immigration detention and deported within days.\n·       Confusion amongst the agencies involved in communicating with Mr Santos is likely to have played a vital role in his change of understanding but it was difficult to pinpoint the role that information passed to Mr Santos played in changing his understanding of his position. There were no adequate notes of a meeting on 22 October 2020 with Mr Santos and his prison and community offender managers. However it was clear that his view of his circumstances changed and he decided to end his life and deliberately did not clearly communicate his intent to those around him.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the Inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.\n \nI have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest.

The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage.\nSignposting legal advice about immigration matters\n \n3.      Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.\n4.      I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.\n5.      In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.\nCommunication between agencies\n \n6.      Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.\n7.      I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.\n \nDelays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.\n \n8.      I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos’ case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos’ case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.\n9.      I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.\nThe SSHD Internal report\n \n10.    The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos’ case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.\n11.    The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos’ case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.\n12.    This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department. Although I am told that these are now being addressed, I am concerned that important learning points (which could prevent future deaths) were not disseminated and actioned as they should have been.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""1.      The death of Manoel Messias Santos (“Mr Santos”) was reported to the coroner by HMP Belmarsh on the date of his death, 2 November 2020.                                                                                      .\n2.      A forensic post-mortem was conducted on 5 November 2020.

A decision was made that she needed antibiotics and a CT scan. The antibiotics were not prescribed until 04:21 and administered at 04:50. The CT scan was ordered at 04:13. The delay was due to the clinical demands on the department. The scan took place at 05:11 and at 05:44 it was reported on. The scan showed a sigmoid colon perforation.

She returned to Tameside General Hospital with concerns over her wound. She subsequently developed a deep vein thrombosis and cellulitis.

She was treated on the Intensive Care Unit until 26th November when she returned to the ward. She continued to be treated for her cellulitis and an ulcer of the left foot that had developed. She was stepped down to the Stamford Unit on 16th December 2022. On 22nd December 2022 she returned to Tameside General Hospital due to concerns about her raised NEWS 2 score, raised probably as a consequence of cellulitis. She was started on intravenous antibiotics. Her liver function was deranged and she had acute kidney injury. She had a catheter but her urine output was difficult to assess due to issues regarding possible catheter bypass. On 24th December, one dose of antibiotics was missed. On 25th December, two doses of antibiotics were missed. She continued to be unwell and on 27th December further antibiotics were prescribed. She was referred to the Critical Care Outreach Team who assessed and determined that Intensive Care Unit referral was not necessary. On 29th December the antibiotics were changed. There was a further referral to Critical Care Outreach that was unsuccessful as there were no staff available. There was no doctor to doctor assessment and no consultant review and no liver specialist advice sought or provided. She continued to deteriorate on 30th December with poor liver function and poor kidney function.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. \n1. Mrs Wadsworth missed three doses of antibiotics prescribed to treat her infection according to the evidence given to the inquest. This did not appear to have been escalated and there was no clear explanation regarding this occurring other than that her cannula may not have been in place and there was a delay in a doctor being available to reinsert one;\n \n2. The evidence before the inquest was that on her admission over Christmas/New Year there was no effective consultant input into her care;\n \n3. The junior doctor involved in her care felt that ICU involvement/input would be beneficial. The evidence was that there did not seem to be any doctor to doctor discussion of this. The inquest heard evidence that this was one way a patient could be transferred to ICU. It was unclear why there had not been such a discussion and whether in periods such as Christmas/ New Year where there were fewer consultants available the system worked effectively. This was not a situation where there had been a ward based ceiling of care put in place and ultimately Mrs Wadsworth was treated by ICU but was extremely unwell at that point and did not respond to that intervention at that point;\n \n4. The alternative support available to ward based staff and possible route into ICU according to the evidence given at inquest was via the Critical Care Outreach team. That team is staffed primarily by nurses and its key focus is on presentation linked to NEWS2 scores according to the evidence given to the inquest. Mrs Wadsworth’s case was a complex one involving issues relating to her liver function and kidney function rather than just her NEWS2 scores and it was unclear if the Critical Care Outreach Team were best placed to assess her need for ICU support;\n \n5. The inquest heard that on the date of one referral that team was not in any event available to the ward and the nurse who should have undertaken the role had been redeployed elsewhere in the trust and there was no capacity to fill that role;\n \n6. Following her first admission to ICU there was a note that Mrs Wadsworth’s case should be discussed with a specialist Liver team. There was no evidence available to the inquest that such a discussion had taken place. It was not entirely clear on the evidence precisely which clinician was to take ownership of the action.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 3rd January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jane Elizabeth Wadsworth .The investigation concluded on the 12th June 2023 and the conclusion was one of ""},""action"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.""},""response"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11th September 2023.

The expert and the Trust’s own Head of Midwifery advised that this was not appropriate. It therefore does not appear that the learning has been passed on to all Trust Midwives and there is a risk that in future cases those treating the baby will be falsely reassured by normal cord pH results which may not be accurate.\n \nWhile I read evidence of some training that had been provided in response to HSIB recommendations for further training on auscultation in addition to saturation monitoring and ECG monitoring during resuscitation, the independent expert also recommended training on UVC and IO access. I am also concerned that there does not appear to have been training in relation to the provision of blood transfusions in such cases to ensure that all potential reversible causes are treated before resuscitation stops.

He died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital on the 3rd March 2022.\n \nAs part of the investigation, I reviewed the medical records.

In his later years he developed cognitive impairment, which in turn led to him being at very high risk of falls. This risk, in relation to which he needed constant supervision, was known to those caring for him and to those responsible for looking after him when he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was admitted to the hospital Emergency Department not because he himself was experiencing a medical emergency, but as a last resort after exhaustive efforts to explore all options before Will was admitted to hospital: it proved not to be possible to find suitable alternative care for him in residential care placements while his wife, and main carer, underwent unplanned emergency major surgery.\n \nThe inquest heard evidence that, prior to his admission to hospital, at least eight social care providers were contacted plus further residential homes, but none of them could provide emergency care for Will. The inquest heard undisputed evidence that this was an instance of a national care shortage.\n \nThe inquest heard evidence that in an Emergency Department where many patients are suffering medical emergencies constant one-to-one supervision will not always be possible. I found as a fact that it was not possible on this occasion and that Will’s fall in the Emergency Department took place when the nursing assistant who was trying to maintain constant one-to-one supervision of Will insofar as possible had their attention momentarily diverted to another patient experiencing a medical emergency. I judged that it would not be just to describe this as a failure on the part of the nursing assistant or the Emergency Department staff.\n \nThe reason why it was not an individual failure included that the inquest heard evidence that the hospital, and in particular the Emergency Department, was experiencing significant pressures associated with high demand and an internal critical incident had been declared. There was a high demand for beds within the hospital without the availability of beds to meet the demand. This included the facts that there were, at the time of Will’s arrival in the Emergency Department, 50 patients in the Emergency Department, of whom 32 were waiting for bed placement. Moreover, staffing was at a ‘black status’ (the worst level) across the hospital, with a deficiency of staff of around 60 nurses and nursing assistants.\n \nI found as a fact that those severe pressures – the high demand levels and the deficiency of staff and scarcity of resource – contributed to the death. Firstly, if it had been possible to care for and supervise Will on a constant basis as he needed, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.\n \nSecondly, on the balance of probabilities, the scarcity of resource relative to demand contributed to Will not being transferred to a ward – or other more appropriate environment – sooner.\n \nApart from the inherent particular difficulties in providing constant supervision in an Emergency Department referred to above, the inquest also received undisputed evidence that the environment of a busy, noisy Emergency Department, with lights on at all hours of the day and night would be overly stimulating and not the most suitable environment for someone with cognitive impairment who was experiencing confusion and agitation. I found that such an environment probably contributed to Will’s inclination to wander and so to his fall.\n \nIf it had been possible to transfer Will to a more suitable environment sooner, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.\n \nI found as a fact that, on the balance of probabilities, the lack of availability of more appropriate care contributed to the death.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\n \n1)  A national care shortage contributed to a situation where a gentleman who was not experiencing a medical emergency, but who required constant supervision for his own safety in view of his cognitive impairment and very high falls risk, could not be cared for anywhere other than in a hospital Emergency Department. If there is not sufficient provision of care, including residential care placements, such that those in similar need do not receive suitable care, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths will occur or continue to exist in the future, when they are placed in an environment that is not realistically able to provide the constant supervision needed, as occurred in this case.\n \nThe severe pressures on the hospital, including the Emergency Department, were such that they were experiencing scarcity of resource relative to demand and a severe deficiency of staff. In these circumstances, it was both not possible to provide the care and supervision that Will needed in the Emergency Department, and the scarcity of resource contributed to Will not being transferred sooner to a ward or other more appropriate environment, where Will could receive the constant supervision that would probably have prevented the fall that led to his death. The evidence was that the scarcity of resource experienced was a challenge on the national level, rather than just a particular local issue. If hospitals, including Emergency Departments, do not receive sufficient resource, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths, due to an inability to provide the required care and / or prompt transfer to an available ward bed or appropriate alternative place, will occur or continue to exist in the future.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 18th March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Joseph Willy Maunick.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th April 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –\n1.     Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;\n \n2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;\n \n3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;\n \n4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson.

Cattle in the field approached them, knocked them down and trampled them, causing serious injuries. Emergency treatment was provided by a doctor who arrived by helicopter. Mr Holmes could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 12:56 that day at the scene of the incident.""},""concerns"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. \n  \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   \n1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. \n  \n1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  \n \n1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.\n \n1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.\n \n1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the ‘application’). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as “essential.”\n \n1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest. The application may well eliminate altogether the risk identified in the incident field.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 1 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John Holmes, aged 57.

Resuscitation algorithm (4 H’s & 4 T’s)* for PEA cardiac arrest\n I heard evidence that the 4 H’s and 4 T’s should be considered and excluded in any PEA cardiac arrest situation. Steps were taken to treat anaphylaxis, but in the absence of any improvement in Teegan’s clinical condition, and whilst it was mentioned, no steps were taken to exclude possible bilateral tension pneumothoraces. Evidence was heard at the Inquest that it is the only one of the 4 H’s and 4 T’s (see footnote) that directly results in a sudden inability to ventilate, with the HSIB report indicating that there was sufficient time to consider and exclude this possibility given the length of time of the PEA cardiac arrest.\n \n2. Surgical emphysem\nThere was a delay in the recognition of surgical emphysema by clinical attendees at the cardiac arrest (medical specialist registrar, consultant obstetricians, anaesthetic core trainee, anaesthetic specialist registrar and the on call consultant anaesthetist) despite indicative clinical signs of deep cyanosis, gross whole body swelling with the need to remove the increasingly constrictive hospital wrist band and endotracheal tube tie, alongside sub-cutaneous crepitus and an abdominal drainage bag noted to be tense with air.\n \n3. Investigation after Teegan’s death\nFollowing this incident, and despite Teegan being intubated and ventilated at the time, with a real possibility of this being an anaesthetic related event, no steps were taken by the anaesthetic department at St Richard’s Hospital, Chichester, either before or after the publication of the HSIB report, to explore potential iatrogenic or other anaesthetic related causes (such as exposure of Teegan’s lungs to excessive volume or pressure) as a possible or probable cause of Teegan’s death.\n \nFurthermore, the anaesthetic machine/ventilator was not taken out of service and assessed to see if there was a fault. Neither was the data from the anaesthetic machine downloaded and interrogated, which may have assisted in establishing how Teegan came to develop bilateral tension pneumothoraces during her emergence from general anaesthesia.\n \nThe failure of the anaesthetic department to undertake any morbidity or mortality review/meeting following Teegan’s death led to a lost opportunity to share any possible learning opportunities both within and outside their department to prevent future deaths, and as a corollary to have been in a position to fully assist both the investigation by the HSIB and the inquest hearing.\n \n4. Trust Clinical Governance procedures\nThe senior management team within the Trust have not acknowledged that there was a lack of a proper and robust system in place to trigger an investigation into all the circumstances of the death of a 17-year-old patient, with no steps taken by them to do so either before or after the publication of the HSIB report or at any time prior to the Inquest hearing.\n \nThis gives rise to a concern of a lack of insight within the senior management team of the importance of undertaking a comprehensive investigation into unexpected deaths within their organisation and for there to be wider dissemination of any institutional learning with the aim of preventing future deaths.\n \nThe failure of the Trust to fully investigate how Teegan came by her death also gives rise to a concern regarding the Trust’s obligation to comply with the Statutory Duty of Candour and their requirement to share their findings with both the regulators and Teegan’s family as well as to indicate the steps, if any, they have taken to prevent future deaths.""},""inquest"":{""old"":"""",""new"":""On 7th January 2022 I resumed an investigation into the death of Teegan Marie Barnard.

She took up residency on discharge from hospital where she had had an inpatient stay as a result of a fall in the community.\n \nOn becoming a resident of Ashley House Barbara had a known diagnosis of dementia, which sometimes affected her memory. She was at a high risk of falling and had blurred vision. All in all, she was a relatively frail elderly woman with known risks around her mobility and she relied on others to keep her safe.\n \nBarbara was the only resident with a bedroom on the first floor of Ashley House. This could only be accessed via the stairs (which Barbara was incapable of ascending or descending safely) or the mechanically operated stairlift (which Barbara was not permitted to use unattended or unsupervised.)\n \nOn the evening of the 8th of August 2022 two carers were on duty; neither of whom were native English speaking nationals; one was Romanian and the other was Indian.\n \nI was told that in order to be able to work in the UK, those requiring a Visa (as the two carers on duty did) must prove that they can read, write, speak and understand English to at least Level B1…. [that they must demonstrate that they] can understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly encountered in work”. Applicants for a Visa must have passed a Secure English Language Test (SELT).\n \nIt transpired during the Inquest that one of the workers on the evening of the 8th August 2022 had never passed the SELT, so was not qualified or permitted to work in the UK.\n \nAt 19:27 one of the carers called 999 to request an ambulance. It was clear, on the evidence, that Barbara had been left unattended on the mechanical chair for around five minutes. This was clearly contrary to the rules and procedures of Ashley House. During those five minutes she has left the seat of the mechanically operated stairlift (possibly unfastening the seat belt) and proceeded to climb the stairs; which she was unable to safely, due to do physical limitations and her underlying cognitive impairment.\n \nShe has fallen on the stairs, falling downwards. There were no witnesses to this incident but Barbara has been found, having fallen awkwardly, landing with her head trapped under the chair for the mechanically operated stairlift. Care staff were unable to free her because of the positioning and angle at which she was entrapped within the mechanics.\n \nOn calling 999 (copies of both recordings were played at the Inquest) it was obvious that neither of the care staff were sufficiently proficient in English to be able to:\nExplain clearly the nature of the medical emergency. An internal audit by the ambulance service revealed that the call-handler had selected an incorrect pathway. The correct pathway that should have been selected was “entrapment” but at no time during the call did the carer give any\ninformation that would have indicated that this was the presenting problem. The carer repeated used the word “blocked” which added no assistance, clarity of explanation of the events that were unfolding.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “bleeding” and “breathing”. This made any meaningful triage of Barbara’s condition virtually impossible. The call handler followed the script to ask if the patient was conscious and breathing (i.e. to ascertain clinical emergency and determination of a priority response) but this assessment was severely hampered given the carer did not appear to know or understand the difference between bleeding and breathing.\n \nUnderstand the difference between “alert” and “alive”, which presented all of the same problems as referred in in (ii) above.\n \nParamedics arrived on a category 2 response and, on arrival, it was clear that Barbara was beyond medical help. She was pronounced deceased at the scene."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\nI am concerned that those working with vulnerable people who are in a position of trust and responsibility must be able to demonstrate a sufficient proficiency in English to enable to summon appropriate emergency medical attention when needed. Vulnerable people, by very definition, are unable to often appreciate the need for help; take steps to keep themselves safe and/or summon help for themselves when they need it.\n \nBy being unable to speak the native language of England with any proficiency I am concerned that deaths will continue to arise where those who are young, disabled, suffering from a mental impairment or who are elderly and in need of urgent medical help will not have this summoned for them if those who are engaging with emergency professionals are unable to communicate effectively.\n \nThe Court looked at evidence of the B1 English test. Examples from the paper were as follows:\n“I                      that book last year” (options are bought, have bought, had bought)\n“The town,                  is very beautiful, has lots of parks” (options are which, where, what).\nThis level of comprehension is comparable to a KS2 curriculum being studied by Year 6 students sitting their SATS exam and appears to be wholly insufficient for those working in the direct care and protection of vulnerable people, as demonstrated in this case by carers who were alone (i.e. no English speaking members of staff on duty) being unable to explain to medical professionals the presenting condition of the patient."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Barbara Jean Rymell, aged 91 (“Barbara”).

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\nWhilst the jury did not make any finding of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in this case, much evidence was heard about the training in identification of the signs and symptoms. National training of police officers on the identification of ABD is focused on a triad of warning flags being, hot to touch, exhibiting constant or near constant activity and extreme agitation or aggression. Some evidence identified that Carl Fullalove did not exhibit these triad symptoms but did exhibit other nuanced symptoms in the long list delivered in training. It was evident that his symptoms were not recognised as ABD due to drug intoxication, and that the consequential risks associated with prone restraint were not therefore considered. Prone restraint ultimately led to his death. There were six experts providing evidence to the inquest two of whom identified that Carl would not have died had he been recognised as unwell at the point of arrest and assessed by a health care practitioner. Such attention would have provided a calming intervention for his heart rate and breathing prior to being placed in prone restraint, which exerted additional pressure on his ability to breath freely.\n \nA research paper before the inquest, namely ‘Consensus on Acute Behavioural Disturbance in the UK, September 2023 recommends that the focus remain on the triad of warning signs. ABD is clearly difficult to distinguish from drug intoxication by a non-medical practitioner. The rigidity of the training with focus on specific symptoms can cause police officers to miss other signs. The Superintendent, and head of ‘Protecting Vulnerable People’ for Cheshire accepted that with hindsight the use of prone restraint was inadvisable in this case.\n \nSignificant training on ABD had been delivered by Cheshire Constabulary through the College of Policing Personal Safety Training package module, the key to which was to identify an underlying medical condition to refer to a health care practitioner. That may be a lot to expect of police officers in a dynamic fast paced setting. The use of the term ABD may be a distraction.\n \nThe effect of stimulant drugs and the need for calming de-escalation in an upright position, rather than prone restraint, had not been noted in either the training material or the research paper presented to the Court. This is on the background of recognising from College of Policing guidance that a high percentage of deaths in prone restraint are in drug related cases.\n \nThe First Aid Learning Programme (FALP) will be in place within Forces by April 2024 and includes amongst other things positional asphyxia, unconscious and not breathing, and ABD but does not mention training in calming intervention that on balance of probabilities may have led to a different outcome in this case."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 04 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carl FULLALOVE aged 29.

He was 79 years old. He had fallen the morning before, at home, and had remained on the floor until admittance to the ED at approximately 05:32 on the 20th December 2022. He had made a first call to the East of England Ambulance Service at around 7:29 pm on the 19th December 2022. The call was allocated a C2 category which aims to have an urgent response within an 18 minute time frame. The EEAS was extremely busy that night with previously unseen levels of C2 allocations of ambulances. In addition, the hospitals in the area were queuing ambulances outside ED’s because they were unable to offload patients and then proceed to other calls. That combination meant that despite being allocated an urgent response time Mr Vincent was effectively left on the floor for a very prolonged time. Ultimately he had a cardiac arrest at home and an ambulance attended promptly. He was resuscitated but the “down time” was prolonged. He died as a result of a combination of an undiagnosed bronchopneumonia complicated by severe coronary artery disease and a long lie. On the balance of probabilities it is likely that had he been admitted at the time of the first call he would not have died at the time he did."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

There then followed a further ten hour delay, during which time he had a cardiac arrest, before he was admitted to the Emergency Department. He had been allocated an appropriate response time, expected within 18 minutes at 1929 on the 19th December 2022. For the reasons given in the circumstances above, that target was missed by an enormous margin. There is a strong possibility, even arguably a probability that another frail, elderly individual, will have the same experience.

This in turn endangers patients, and creates a risk that people will die in the future as a result of such errors.\n \nIt is, sadly, very easy to envisage circumstances in which a patient might not receive essential medication at all, might receive the wrong dose of the medication they need, or might receive the wrong medication altogether, because of a transcription error.\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On 31 October 2022 an investigation commenced into the death of Ms Cherry Lynne GARLAND, aged 77.

He did not simply arrive at hospital,  but   had been assessed and then sent there by his GP, who felt, rightly as it turned out, that Derek may have developed an obstruction. He was anticipating   Derek would be seen quickly.\n \n·      He arrived at the Emergency Department, and handed in some paperwork at reception and understandably expected he would not have to wait long to be assessed by doctors who he knew were expecting him.\n \n·      No-one called for him for almost two hours by which time he had died.\n \n·      It is correct to say that once a post mortem examination was performed, it was clear that even if he had been assessed immediately upon arrival at hospital his condition was such that surgical intervention was not a realistic possibility and the condition was going to prove terminal.\n \n·      At the time Derek arrived, as the Hospital Trust’s own internal review of this death explained, such were the pressures on the hospital Trust posed by patient numbers that it was operating at OPEL [Operations Pressure Escalation Level] 4. This is a method used by the NHS to measure the stress, demands, and pressure a hospital is under. OPEL 4 represents the highest level, when a hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient\nsafety is at risk”."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \n·      Concern 1 – that the medical professionals who work in a hospital emergency department are routinely expected to do so when the OPEL 4 applies, a recognition they are performing their roles when the hospital is “unable to deliver comprehensive care, and patient safety is at risk”. Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.\n \n·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for. There is a clear risk that puts patients at risk and it would be remiss of me not to raise it.\n \n·      Concern 3 – Finally, it is relevant to point out that Derek had not moved for    some time before a medical professional called for Derek.  I  formed the  view that there had been a reluctance on his Friend’s part to request assistance due   to the pressures staff were clearly under, but also because he had already  handed in Derek’s paperwork and was expecting some assistance imminently which did not arrive. I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""The death of Harold Derek PEDLEY Otherwise known as Derek PEDLEY on 21.12.22 at Blackpool Victoria Hospital was reported to me and I opened an investigation, which concluded by way of an inquest held on 17th August 2023.   "",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

He said in his evidence that the pressure sore was first documented by the orthopaedic team on 21stJune, the surgeon described this now as – the bigger source of infection.  \n \nAn MRI was requested but did not take place for 4 days; it was undertaken on 25th June and reported as showing no obvious sacral osteomyelitis it did show that it had locally spread in the soft tissue.  \n \nBy 28th June Mr Nippard was getting worse, his inflammatory markers were going up and now his testicles were swollen, and there was a suspicion was that this was Fournier’s Gangrene and there was a referral made to the Urology team. \n   \nThe orthopaedic surgeon said that as far as the treatment for Mr Nippard’s knee went, he felt they were winning that it was improving that if he hadn’t developed the pressure sore his expectation was that he would have been discharged. He agreed with the medical cause of death proposed.  \n \nA Consultant Urologist examined Mr Nippard on 28th June, he said that he had evidence of a significant infection, that the only treatment was surgery, and all agreed that surgery was not likely to help, and it would cause Mr Nippard immense suffering in his last days. He explained that the other medical conditions Mr Nippard suffered with caused him to be compromised, if he’d had a stronger heart and kidneys then they would have operated \n \nSadly, after discussions with Urologists, Surgeons, Anesthetists and the Critical care team it was decided that Mr Nippard was not fit for surgery, and he was placed on priorities of care and died on 6th   July 2022. \n \nIt was the view of the doctors who attended the inquest and gave evidence that the pressure sore significantly contributed to Mr Nippard’s death."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

On the 19 December 2022 he was stepped down from intensive care to a ward. He was at a very high risk of developing a thromboembolism due to his cancer diagnosis, recent surgery, lengthy period in hospital and immobility. During the period of 9 to 15 January 2023 he refused his anti- coagulation medication on three occasions. The reason for refusal is unclear and there is no documented evidence that the risk of non-compliance with the medication was explained to him or escalated to the medical team. On the 20 January 2023, Mr. James suffered from an acute deterioration in his health, culminating in a cardiac arrest.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\n \nEvidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:\n \n1. The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (“the unit”) which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.\n \n2. The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.\n \n3. The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.\n \n4. The “Sign in/Sign out” book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.\n \n5. There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.\n \n6. The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased’s medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.\n \n7.  Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.\n \n8. The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.\n \n9. No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased’s family once the deceased was found to be missing.\n \n10. The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.\n \nThe summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern."",""new"":""""},""inquest"":{""old"":""On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021 [REDACTED].\n \nThe investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.\n \nI made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:\n \n1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.\n \n2. On occasions, the deceased’s psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.\n \n3. On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.\n \n4. At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.\n \n5. The deceased’s condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.\n \n6. The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.\n \n7. Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.\n \n8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased’s home address.\n \n9.  At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased’s mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased’s home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021."",""new"":""""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action."",""new"":""""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4th August 2023.

He had suffered from hypoxic brain damage and died at Ashford Hospital, Kent on the 28th of July. The other five deceased were all part of a party of five young Sri Lankan men who travelled together to Camber to enjoy a day at the beach on 24t of August 2016. They all went into the sea at a time when the tide had started to come in. It is not known how well any of them could swim. It is thought that they were all on a sand bar when they were overtaken and cut off by the incoming tide. All five bodies were recovered to the shore that day, or found after the tide had receded. The RNLI had recommended deploying lifeguards at the beach in 2013 but Rother District Council had not implemented that recommendation. It was accepted quite quickly after these deaths and lifeguards are now deployed. There was considerable evidence at the inquest on the question of whether that step, and others recommended, would have prevented any of the deaths. It should be noted that the length of the beach from which people can swim is about three miles and the distance between high water mark and low water mark is as much as a kilometre in some tides."",""new"":""""},""concerns"":{""old"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Although the 2 relevant Councils were duty bound to house both individuals up until the age of 21 under the Leaving Care Act, there is currently no regulation for the over 18’s. Regulation is being introduced for 16- 17 year olds in April 2023.\n \nBoth Councils were in agreement that Regulation of this sector would be welcomed to support them in carrying out their statutory obligations . A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC’s regulation as the provision is not for “care” but support. The provision is made from an entirely un-regulated sector, resulting in some organisations offering accommodation with inadequate training, staffing or knowledge to meet the complex needs of some of our most vulnerable individuals.
