Liaison and Diversion Team members visited Mr Goodwin at home and concluded that he was at risk of self- neglect. They noted his appearance, his living conditions and the fact that he was not taking prescribed medication. On any view Mr Goodwin was vulnerable: he suffered from Alzheimer’s dementia, and was thought to misuse alcohol. The Liaison and Diversion Team considered that there were safeguarding concerns in respect of Mr Goodwin and referred him to the Adult Social Care team of Cumbria Council. I understand that the team in question now forms part of Westmorland and Furness Council. Despite this referral from practitioners who had personally visited Mr Goodwin, it was rejected at triage on 5th October 2022. I am concerned that this indicates that an approach to triage is being taken which pays insufficient regard to the concerns of practitioners who had personally witnessed apparent safeguarding concerns.\r\n \r\n(2)  The witness statement on behalf of the Adult Social Care team explains that after the refusal to conduct a safeguarding enquiry, Mr Goodwin was nevertheless referred for the Social Work team to ‘engage’ with him. A social worker took steps to engage with Mr Goodwin and his family and concluded that a care assessment was appropriate. Despite\r\nthis the ‘Reablement Team’ referred the case for closure indicating that they did not consider that such an assessment was not required. I am concerned that this indicates further circumstances in which the needs of a vulnerable person might be overlooked. After a social worker considered that a care assessment was needed the Reablement Team appear to be able to come to an alternative view and close the case without further discussion or rationale. In another case this might lead to a vulnerable person being disregarded.\r\n \r\n(3)  Fortunately, the Closure Team noticed that the Reablement Team were seeking to close a case in which another social worker had recommended a Care Assessment. They sent the case to the ‘Short Term Allocation Tray’. This should have resulted in a referral but that did not happen. I am concerned that in a future case a referral might not be generated and a person’s needs overlooked.

On 15 September, Mr Di Blasi was referred by a GP to the Lower Gastro-intestinal team for possible bowel cancer and had a CT scan on 4 November 2022. The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the\r\nreport until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022. The incidental findings were not considered to be ‘significant’ by the Radiologists and were not therefore warrant an alert being sent to the referring clinician, leaving the report to be reviewed when they were able to.

On 15 September, Mr Di Blasi was referred by a GP to the Lower Gastro-intestinal team for possible bowel cancer and had a CT scan on 4 November 2022. The CT scan revealed cirrhosis with portal hypertension and gastric varices, which were new incidental findings. The Lower GI team had been made aware of the investigations ongoing by the Upper GI team, but the upper GI team were unaware of the Lower GI team’s involvement. Both referrals were made on the 2 week cancer referral pathway. The CT Scan was reported on 14 November, and double reported on 16 November 2022. However, the referring clinician did not review the\nreport until the day after Mr Di Blasi’s death, on 2 December 2022. The incidental findings were not considered to be ‘significant’ by the Radiologists and were not therefore warrant an alert being sent to the referring clinician, leaving the report to be reviewed when they were able to.

Lauren was 20 years of age. The other inquest involved a 15 years old patient – 115 miles from home.\r\n \r\nBoth of these cases illustrate,\r\na)       Underfunding for local mental health beds.\r\nb)       An over-reliance by the NHS on independent providers for mental health beds.\r\n \r\nThe Government set itself a target to eliminate inappropriate (which I infer would include delayed discharge) Out-of-Area in-patient placements in mental health services for adults by 2020-21.\r\n \r\nMatter Two\r\nThe jury identified inadequate and insufficient communication between Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust, The Priory and relevant parties.\r\n \r\nI heard evidence that Dorset Healthcare NHS Trust have appointed a designated Care Co-ordinator for its Out-of-Area patients. Having a single point of contact will alleviate some of the communication issues identified.\r\n \r\nI heard evidence from The Priory as to some of the challenges it faces when dealing with the NHS commissioning bodies, be they Hospital Trusts or Integrated Care Boards. The Priory is just one of the several independent providers of mental health care.\r\n1.        The Priory deals with 42 NHS separate commissioning bodies.\r\n2.        There are multiple software programmes for record keeping for these organisations, which makes transfer and sharing of clinical information cumbersome and difficult, as direct sharing is not possible.\r\n3.        These bodies have varying processes and requests for communication.\r\n4.        There is no national standard process for referrals into the independent sector nor for discharge/repatriation to the ‘home team’.\r\n \r\nWith regard to delayed discharge/repatriation of an Out-of-Area patient I heard evidence that The Priory have devised a protocol/standing operating procedure in respect of delayed discharge, which should reduce the risks of a patient being left miles from home at all and in any event reduce the time taken to repatriate. However, it relies on the ‘home team’s’ engagement in the process. In brief, the protocol is as follows,\r\n1.        Once it has been determined that a patient is ready for discharge/step- down/repatriation BUT no bed/placement is available that is a delayed discharge and the protocol is triggered.\r\n2.        In week one The Priory MDT hold a professionals meeting to explore reasons for delay and together with the ‘home team’ identify SMART actions.\r\n3.        If after 4 weeks there is limited progress The Priory MDT will request the ‘home team’ ICB to arrange a Care & Treatment Review.\r\n4.        If there is, by then, no or little progress there should be discussions between the Priory Head of NHS Partnerships and the ‘home team’ Commissioning Managers.\r\n5.        As a last resort: service of notice on the patient’s placement.\r\n \r\nThe protocol is heavily reliant on engagement from, and cooperation of, the numerous NHS commissioning bodies. The protocol requires a low threshold for the escalation of delays to the appropriate manager and/or commissioner at the ‘home service’.\r\n \r\nThere are over 60 independent providers for in-patient mental health services.\r\n \r\nThe initiative taken by The Priory is to be applauded but it is just one of many independent providers for some 42 separate NHS commissioning bodies. There is a clear danger that it will not be adopted by the other independent providers, indeed there is no reason for them to be aware of its existence. In  the premises, Out-of-Area  delayed discharge, and its detrimental effect on a patient’s mental health, will remain a matter of concern.\r\n \r\nWhile there remains a shortage of local NHS mental beds and the Government remains committed to eliminating inappropriate Out-of-Area in-patient placements the development of protocols or standardised operating procedures to avoid delayed discharge, or limit the length of delay, is a clearly a matter for the NHS rather than the individual independent providers."",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The Priory is just one of the several independent providers of mental health care.\n1.        The Priory deals with 42 NHS separate commissioning bodies.\n2.        There are multiple software programmes for record keeping for these organisations, which makes transfer and sharing of clinical information cumbersome and difficult, as direct sharing is not possible.\n3.        These bodies have varying processes and requests for communication.\n4.        There is no national standard process for referrals into the independent sector nor for discharge/repatriation to the ‘home team’.\n \nWith regard to delayed discharge/repatriation of an Out-of-Area patient I heard evidence that The Priory have devised a protocol/standing operating procedure in respect of delayed discharge, which should reduce the risks of a patient being left miles from home at all and in any event reduce the time taken to repatriate. However, it relies on the ‘home team’s’ engagement in the process. In brief, the protocol is as follows,\n1.        Once it has been determined that a patient is ready for discharge/step- down/repatriation BUT no bed/placement is available that is a delayed discharge and the protocol is triggered.\n2.        In week one The Priory MDT hold a professionals meeting to explore reasons for delay and together with the ‘home team’ identify SMART actions.\n3.        If after 4 weeks there is limited progress The Priory MDT will request the ‘home team’ ICB to arrange a Care & Treatment Review.\n4.        If there is, by then, no or little progress there should be discussions between the Priory Head of NHS Partnerships and the ‘home team’ Commissioning Managers.\n5.        As a last resort: service of notice on the patient’s placement.\n \nThe protocol is heavily reliant on engagement from, and cooperation of, the numerous NHS commissioning bodies. The protocol requires a low threshold for the escalation of delays to the appropriate manager and/or commissioner at the ‘home service’.\n \nThere are over 60 independent providers for in-patient mental health services.\n \nThe initiative taken by The Priory is to be applauded but it is just one of many independent providers for some 42 separate NHS commissioning bodies. There is a clear danger that it will not be adopted by the other independent providers, indeed there is no reason for them to be aware of its existence. In  the premises, Out-of-Area  delayed discharge, and its detrimental effect on a patient’s mental health, will remain a matter of concern.\n \nWhile there remains a shortage of local NHS mental beds and the Government remains committed to eliminating inappropriate Out-of-Area in-patient placements the development of protocols or standardised operating procedures to avoid delayed discharge, or limit the length of delay, is a clearly a matter for the NHS rather than the individual independent providers.""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\r\n \r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\r\nWhilst the jury did not make any finding of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in this case, much evidence was heard about the training in identification of the signs and symptoms. National training of police officers on the identification of ABD is focused on a triad of warning flags being, hot to touch, exhibiting constant or near constant activity and extreme agitation or aggression. Some evidence identified that Carl Fullalove did not exhibit these triad symptoms but did exhibit other nuanced symptoms in the long list delivered in training. It was evident that his symptoms were not recognised as ABD due to drug intoxication, and that the consequential risks associated with prone restraint were not therefore considered. Prone restraint ultimately led to his death. There were six experts providing evidence to the inquest two of whom identified that Carl would not have died had he been recognised as unwell at the point of arrest and assessed by a health care practitioner. Such attention would have provided a calming intervention for his heart rate and breathing prior to being placed in prone restraint, which exerted additional pressure on his ability to breath freely.\r\n \r\nA research paper before the inquest, namely ‘Consensus on Acute Behavioural Disturbance in the UK, September 2023 recommends that the focus remain on the triad of warning signs. ABD is clearly difficult to distinguish from drug intoxication by a non-medical practitioner. The rigidity of the training with focus on specific symptoms can cause police officers to miss other signs. The Superintendent, and head of ‘Protecting Vulnerable People’ for Cheshire accepted that with hindsight the use of prone restraint was inadvisable in this case.\r\n \r\nSignificant training on ABD had been delivered by Cheshire Constabulary through the College of Policing Personal Safety Training package module, the key to which was to identify an underlying medical condition to refer to a health care practitioner. That may be a lot to expect of police officers in a dynamic fast paced setting. The use of the term ABD may be a distraction.\r\n \r\nThe effect of stimulant drugs and the need for calming de-escalation in an upright position, rather than prone restraint, had not been noted in either the training material or the research paper presented to the Court. This is on the background of recognising from College of Policing guidance that a high percentage of deaths in prone restraint are in drug related cases.\r\n \r\nThe First Aid Learning Programme (FALP) will be in place within Forces by April 2024 and includes amongst other things positional asphyxia, unconscious and not breathing, and ABD but does not mention training in calming intervention that on balance of probabilities may have led to a different outcome in this case."",""new"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\r\n \r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\r\n \r\n(1)  The serious incident investigation by the Trust has been substantially delayed. Sarah died on the 10th of July 2022 and the Trust confirmed to the Coroner’s service that there was to be a serious incident investigation on the 26th July 2022. The serious incident investigation remained unallocated and with no timeframe for completion for over 7 months and on the 13th of March 2023 as this remained the position I listed this case for Inquest on the 24th of April 2023. On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased’s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be’ likely end of July/August time’. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the ‘end of September/beginning of October’ and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased’s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author’s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due ‘end of September/beginning of October’. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.\r\n \r\n(2)  The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.\r\n \r\n(3)  If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah’s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.\r\n \r\n(4)  I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths.\r\n \r\n(5)  I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust’s response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report."",""new"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

On the 17th April 2023 I was alerted by deceased’s family to possible progress in respect of the serious incident investigation in this case, subsequent to their formal complaint to the Trust. After making enquiries of the Trust I was informed that the report would be available at the end of May 2023 and I therefore acceded to a family request to adjourn the final hearing given the short delay this would cause. On the 25th of April 2023 the Coronial service was informed that in fact that it was unlikely that the report would be finalised by May and would be’ likely end of July/August time’. On the 26th of June I was informed that the report would now not be available until the ‘end of September/beginning of October’ and that the initial dates given were “too ambitious”. The case was listed to commence on the 16th of November 2023 on that basis. On the 28th of July the deceased’s family notified me of a likely further delay in the report being available due to the author’s sick leave from work. The Trust offered reassurance that the report remained due ‘end of September/beginning of October’. On the 28th of September a Pre Inquest Review Hearing was held in relation to a separate discrete issue and I was informed that the report was to be further delayed and would not be available until the end of October.\n \n(2)  The NHS framework sets out clearly a timescale of 60 working days for the completion of investigation reports and highlights the importance of working in an open, honest and transparent way. One of the key underpinning principles in the management of all serious incidents is that they should be timely and responsive. The purpose of the investigation is to ensure that weaknesses in a system or process are identified to understand what went wrong, how it went wrong and what can be done to prevent similar incidents occurring again.\n \n(3)  If the final version report is received by the end of October it will be some 15 months since Sarah’s death and some 13 months outside the NHS framework. This is neither timely nor responsive.\n \n(4)  I have previously issued a PFD report in relation to this issue as has the Senior Coroner for Durham and Darlington, Mr Chipperfield, who stated that Tees Esk and Wear Valleys NHS Foundation Trust routinely fails, to employ, in a timely way, nationally recognised process and procedure designed to prevent avoidable death. In permitting delay of “serious incident” investigations, TEWV may: (i) permit lethal hazard to persist for longer than necessary; and (ii) compromise the quality of such investigations and hence their value in preventing avoidable deaths.\n \n(5)  I am concerned that these dangers persist, despite the Trust’s response to previous PFD reports and their assurances that remedial action was being taken to eradicate the delays, and as a result it is my statutory duty to make this further report.""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 6th of December 2023.

After he was remanded in custody, he was placed on an ACCT twice in prison. After his release from prison on 14th February 2021, he was referred to the community Mental Health Crisis service by his GP and also had another very recent suicide attempt in the form of an overdose of anti- depressants about a week before he was again arrested on 17th March 2021. In Police custody, he was seen by a Custodial Nurse Practitioner (CNP) who had very limited training in Mental Health and the recognition of the risk of suicide. The CNP was working alone and not alongside a doctor. The CNP assessed Jack’s risk as low. The CNP also did not refer him to Liaison & Diversion services, which the jury found that probably contributed to Jack’s death. A Forensic Medical Examiner in Police custody subsequently\r\nassessed Jack’s risk as high. Jack was again remanded in custody.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\r\n \r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.\r\n1.       The use of Custodial Nurse Practitioners (CNPs) in Police custody instead of doctors. The 2003 Home Office circular appeared to envisage nurses working alongside doctors, when this is not how they are deployed. CNPs are also seeing high risk and complex patients without adequate training in mental health. The deployment in Police custody of CNPs places detained persons at risk of death in the future.

A number of these have been addressed and do not require a PFD report.\r\n \r\nI have also considered a report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, “The experience of immigration detainees in prisons,” dated September 2022. Some of the key concerns in that report mirror concerns I came to independently having heard the evidence in this Inquest.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\r\n \r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\r\n1.      Although the specific issues below were not left to the jury as “causative matters” in this Inquest, I am concerned about the potential impact of these issues in other cases.\r\nTiming of IS91 notification.\r\n \r\n2.      The timing of the notification to Mr Santos by the SSHD that he was not to be released at the end of his custodial sentence but was to be held on immigration detention pending a decision on deportation. The SSHD target for notification is 30 days prior to release. In this case it was 8 days late. I heard PFD evidence that this 30-day target is not met in 40% of cases and that 83% of cases are notified within 7 days of the end of the sentence. I am concerned at the potential uncertainty and distress caused to Foreign National Offenders (“FNOs”) by notification at this stage.\r\nSignposting legal advice about immigration matters\r\n \r\n3.      Mr Santos signed a form on 24 October 2020 to receive support from a charity supporting immigration detainees. Bail forms were sent to them by the prison on 29 October 2020.\r\n4.      I am concerned as to how access to legal advice is facilitated and signposted.\r\n5.      In PFD evidence, I was informed that FNOs (in a similar position to Mr Santos) are now entitled to 30 minutes of free legal advice following a High Court decision in February 2021. In HMP Belmarsh, this entitlement is displayed on a notice in each Houseblock. I am concerned that displaying a notice is insufficient to draw this entitlement to the attention of FNOs. I do not know if this is a wider issue in other prisons. Understanding of immigration status, including appeal and bail procedures and is complex. Access to legal advice is vital to prevent confusion.\r\nCommunication between agencies\r\n \r\n6.      Communication issues between the agencies dealing with immigration and sentence planning may lead to confusion and uncertainty for FNOs.\r\n7.      I appreciate that any legal advice to FNOs should be from a legal adviser. I am encouraged that the probation service (who employ community offender managers) is seeking to develop a cohort of probation officers specialising in FNOs and immigration. There are now 201 SPOCs across 12 regions and a hub lead developing this model and leading engagement with the SSHD. There is no such model in the prison in respect of “prison offender managers” who also liaise with the SSHD about FNOs.\r\n \r\nDelays by SSHD and Probation and failure to obtain information.\r\n \r\n8.      I am concerned at the potential impact of delays/failure to obtain information in other cases. In Mr Santos’ case there were delays by probation in allocating a community offender manager and providing an up-to-date OASYS report. There were also delays by the SSHD progressing Mr Santos’ case, including issue of the Stage 2 letter, failure to obtain medical records and delay in requesting the OASYS report.\r\n9.      I am encouraged that there is now a centralised system (and form) for the SSHD to request OASYS reports from probation although it is not clear the extent to which requests are going through this system. Consent to obtain medical information is sought from FNOs at an induction meeting by Immigration Prison Teams (“IPTs”). Further IPT officers attend prisons and play a key role in obtaining this type of information. However it is not clear what systems are in place to facilitate the obtaining of medical information.\r\nThe SSHD Internal report\r\n \r\n10.    The SSHD disclosed an Internal report into Mr Santos’ case midway through the Inquest, which was not on his Home Office file. The lawyers representing the SSHD were unaware of this report. The head of FNO Returns Command only became aware of it the preceding week and understood it had been disclosed.\r\n11.    The report detailed delays and issues in Mr Santos’ case and the SSHD then made formal admissions of the relevant (non-causative) failures which were recorded by the jury in the Record of Inquest at my direction.\r\n12.    This report was dated February 2021 and listed action points for the relevant department.

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\r\n \r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\r\n(brief summary of matters of concern)\r\n \r\nHMP Aylesbury transitioned from a High Security Young Offenders Institution (a role it had undertaken for many years) into a Category C Training Prison after the time in which Haik Nikolyan had been an inmate. This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs.\r\n \r\nStaffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time.\r\n \r\nHealthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today.\r\n \r\nFollowing the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward.\r\n \r\nI was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward.\r\n \r\nSome three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers.\r\n \r\nAlthough initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work.\r\n \r\nThe evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution.\r\n \r\nThe indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majesty’s Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury."",""new"":""During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

This has led to a quite different cohort of prisoners with different and additional issues to be addressed in their management and healthcare needs.\n \nStaffing changes have also occurred over the period, although the physical prison infrastructure is largely the same with some wing refurbishments being undertaken from time to time.\n \nHealthcare provision is also being undertaken by different providers today.\n \nFollowing the conclusion in March this year of an Inquest into the death of another young prisoner, Anthony McNally, at Aylesbury (which occurred in January 2021), a letter was written by me to the Governor in which I noted, inter alia, that the evolution to Category C status required time and resources and was not without significant challenges going forward.\n \nI was then (as now) interested to hear that appropriate resources continued to be sought and deployed by the prison to continue the work, from prison and healthcare perspectives, adapting to the Category C status, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of prisoners, staff and those with cause to visit the prison going forward.\n \nSome three months further on, my concerns are heightened to the extent that a death may result in a variety of circumstances through the continuing significant issues HMP Aylesbury is encountering in recruitment and retention of experienced prison staff, particularly Grade 3 officers.\n \nAlthough initial steps are being taken towards implementation of a new neurodiversity plan, including the management of prisoners with autistic traits (pertinent to the circumstances of the death of Haik Nikolyan in 2019) and some recruitment has just taken place, without appropriate resources specifically in this area and within the broader staff cohort, there will be difficulties in maintaining this important work.\n \nThe evidence heard at this Inquest in July 2023 indicates that general staffing levels are likely to impact upon the operation of the daily regime, training and reaction to individual incidents, against a background of increasing levels of violence and access to illicit substances, resulting from the changing cohort of longer-term and older prisoners within this Category C institution.\n \nThe indication in evidence was that addressing these issues and continuing to address these issues is a matter for His Majesty’s Prisons and Probation Service, working with HMP Aylesbury.""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 10th October 2023.

Such pressures may serve to leave the Emergency Department unable to triage patients such as Derek, and have no time to notify the doctors expecting his arrival (in this case doctors on the Surgical Assessment Unit) who are consequently left unaware  that a patient has in fact arrived, all of which serves to place vulnerable patients such as Derek Pedley at serious risk.\r\n \r\n·      Concern 2 – that there is a risk that the pressures on hospitals become so significant they are used as a default explanation for levels of patient care that fall below what they would wish to deliver. I found that the hospital Trust did not seek to do so in this case, but it seems to me there is a risk this could  happen. The pressures are indeed significant, but ultimately this case involves a 90 year old man with what appears to be an acute medical problem finding himself attending his local emergency department, not  being spoken to  / triaged by a medical professional for almost two hours, and dying by the time   he is called for.

I feel Derek and his Friend thought as they knew doctors  had discussed his case with his GP and that his attendance was expected they   did not need to raise a concern until it was too late. In actual fact, such are the pressures Emergency Departments are working under, this may not  be the case. It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures."",""new"":""During the  course of the  inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.  In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

It is not for me  to be  prescriptive about what should be  done, but unless  GPs are provided with a realistic picture about how quickly their patients may be   seen once they arrive at hospital (even if they have been in communication with the hospital doctors) their patients may arrive at hospital expecting to be seen quickly, when in reality this may not be the case particularly when the department is under significant pressures.""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

Whilst Wetherspoons staff have been trained to comply with EMD instructions there are occasions such as this case where staff could implement CPR of their own accord before being instructed to do so by EMD’s. The training would not only teach staff the correct techniques but educate them of the situations in which CPR should be used.\n \nIn my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –\n \n1.       In a pub environment there is a greater chance for the public to sustain injuries that requires emergency treatment\n2.       Ordinary bystanders’ ability to administer emergency treatment may be hindered by their own consumption of alcohol\n3.       Whilst the primary responsibility of staff is to comply with EMD directions they are deprived of the opportunity to provide lifesaving treatment in circumstances that warrant it if that training is not offered\n4.       Staff would not know the circumstances that warrant it without the benefit of CPR training.""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 19 October 2023.

Because she had mental capacity the OT service respected her wishes.\r\n·       Shirley’s husband who was the main carer at the time of her death did not receive any training from the local authority in safe usage of the hoist and in particular use of the red emergency pull cord. It was not clear whether Shirley had received any training on the use of the red pull cord when she was provided with the hoist because there was no paperwork confirming training had been delivered.\r\n·       I found that when Shirley was suspended in the hoist, she did not use the red pull cord, on the underside of the hoist unit, because it had not lowered and because her husband was able to use the hand control to manoeuvre her toward the scooter. He would not be able to do this if the red cord had been pulled because the electric power would switch off.\r\n·       Higher Elevation reported inspections of the hoist to the AMT but not to the OT department. The AMT, in turn, did not share those reports with the OT department.\r\n·       The Inspection by Bureau Veritas 30/6/23 only reported to AMT but not the OT dept.

Veritas reported there were no problems on its last inspection of 30/6/23 over 2 weeks before the death. That report was made without sight of the Shirley’s report to the OT department, on 9/4/21, and the Higher Elevation report to the AMT on the same day.\r\n·       I was also told by Shirley’s husband that the same model of hoist in the bathroom had also failed to lower on occasions.\r\n·       At present the bedroom hoist, and hoists in the bathroom and living room remain in situ at Shirley’s home and are available for inspection. Shirley was a local authority tenant when she died and due to pressure on its housing stock the local authority is anxious to re-let the property to new tenants.

The radiologist’s report on the scan, dated the 8th November 2020, mentioned findings of multiple lung nodules and included a differential diagnosis of lung metastases. This outcome was never seen by the requesting clinician, nor any other clinician (including the Deceased’s General Practitioner). I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy; I was told that “the reporter would not raise this as an incidental finding because malignancy was already queried and would expect the referring clinician to review results”. The Consultant Colorectal Surgeon told me, however, that his understanding of the system was that he would be alerted to any finding or suspicion of malignancy. Further, although the Deceased had subsequently been given three outpatients appointments, the error was not picked up through these because all three appointments were cancelled by the hospital and the Deceased was not seen by the colorectal team again.\r\n \r\n3.     Secondly, a further CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax was undertaken on the 9th April 2022, but the formal report (suspicious for lung cancer) was not made until the 24th May 2022, and this resulting in delay in the Deceased being seen on the cancer pathway by the respiratory team. It seems that the delay in reporting was because a second hospital number had been used for the Deceased when the scan was performed in an external CT scanner located on the King George Hospital site.\r\n \r\n4.     At the inquest, I heard oral evidence from [REDACTED] , and I received documentary evidence, explaining the changes which have been made since the Deceased’s death. The documentation received included an 11 point Action Plan, supported by evidence as to the action that has been taken. On the basis of that evidence, I am satisfied that most of the concerns relating to the Deceased’s scan reporting and other management have been addressed.\r\n \r\n5.     I do, however, have two ongoing concerns about the system in place for the communication of concerning radiological findings. Steps have been taken to improve the system previously in place. In particular, I have been provided with a copy of the Trust’s new “Radiology Unsuspected Cancers and Critical Findings Protocol” which, I am told, has now been approved, and will be adopted, by the Radiology Clinical Leads and Clinical Governance Leads across North East London. I was also told that a new electronic scan requesting and reporting system will “go live” in August 2023, and that this will enable unexpected cancers and other incidental critical findings to be “red-flagged” directly to the requesting team. The system will also have an “acknowledgment option” enabling the referring doctor to click on a read receipt for all radiology reports.\r\n \r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows:\r\nConcern 1:\r\nThe Trust’s new policy is concerned with ensuring that unexpected cancer or other critical radiological findings are highlighted to the requesting team. However, the evidence at the inquest suggested that requesting team were not alerted to the suspicious outcome of the Deceased’s November 2020 scan because it was an expected finding; as stated above, I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy and the outcome was not, therefore, treated as unexpected. I am concerned, therefore, that the same could happen again, despite the changes which have been made.

I am concerned, however, that the use of the read receipt is optional as this will inevitably undermine the extent to which any monitoring system will be able to spot and identify unread reports. I did not consider that either [REDACTED], nor the Consultant Colorectal Surgeon from whom I heard evidence about the plans for monitoring in the surgical department of Queens Hospital, were able to address this concern satisfactorily in their evidence."",""new"":""Background:\n1.     The evidence at the inquest showed that the results of two separate scans performed on the Deceased, both of which had concerning outcomes, were not seen and acted upon in a timely manner.\n \n2.     First, on the 8th October 2020, a Consultant Colorectal Surgeon at Queens Hospital requested a CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax, abdomen and pelvis because the Deceased had reported significant weight loss and other symptoms. The radiologist’s report on the scan, dated the 8th November 2020, mentioned findings of multiple lung nodules and included a differential diagnosis of lung metastases. This outcome was never seen by the requesting clinician, nor any other clinician (including the Deceased’s General Practitioner). I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy; I was told that “the reporter would not raise this as an incidental finding because malignancy was already queried and would expect the referring clinician to review results”. The Consultant Colorectal Surgeon told me, however, that his understanding of the system was that he would be alerted to any finding or suspicion of malignancy. Further, although the Deceased had subsequently been given three outpatients appointments, the error was not picked up through these because all three appointments were cancelled by the hospital and the Deceased was not seen by the colorectal team again.\n \n3.     Secondly, a further CT scan of the Deceased’s thorax was undertaken on the 9th April 2022, but the formal report (suspicious for lung cancer) was not made until the 24th May 2022, and this resulting in delay in the Deceased being seen on the cancer pathway by the respiratory team. It seems that the delay in reporting was because a second hospital number had been used for the Deceased when the scan was performed in an external CT scanner located on the King George Hospital site.\n \n4.     At the inquest, I heard oral evidence from [REDACTED] , and I received documentary evidence, explaining the changes which have been made since the Deceased’s death. The documentation received included an 11 point Action Plan, supported by evidence as to the action that has been taken. On the basis of that evidence, I am satisfied that most of the concerns relating to the Deceased’s scan reporting and other management have been addressed.\n \n5.     I do, however, have two ongoing concerns about the system in place for the communication of concerning radiological findings. Steps have been taken to improve the system previously in place. In particular, I have been provided with a copy of the Trust’s new “Radiology Unsuspected Cancers and Critical Findings Protocol” which, I am told, has now been approved, and will be adopted, by the Radiology Clinical Leads and Clinical Governance Leads across North East London. I was also told that a new electronic scan requesting and reporting system will “go live” in August 2023, and that this will enable unexpected cancers and other incidental critical findings to be “red-flagged” directly to the requesting team. The system will also have an “acknowledgment option” enabling the referring doctor to click on a read receipt for all radiology reports.\n \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERNS are as follows:\nConcern 1:\nThe Trust’s new policy is concerned with ensuring that unexpected cancer or other critical radiological findings are highlighted to the requesting team. However, the evidence at the inquest suggested that requesting team were not alerted to the suspicious outcome of the Deceased’s November 2020 scan because it was an expected finding; as stated above, I was told that the radiologist’s report was not escalated or alerted to the clinical or multi-disciplinary teams because the requesting form had indicated that the scan was to rule out malignancy and the outcome was not, therefore, treated as unexpected. I am concerned, therefore, that the same could happen again, despite the changes which have been made. I did not consider that [REDACTED] was able to address this concern satisfactorily in his evidence.\n \nConcern 2:\nThe new electronic system is introducing a “read receipt” feature which, if used, would enable identification of reports which have not been opened and read by the requesting team in a timely manner. I am concerned, however, that the use of the read receipt is optional as this will inevitably undermine the extent to which any monitoring system will be able to spot and identify unread reports. I did not consider that either [REDACTED], nor the Consultant Colorectal Surgeon from whom I heard evidence about the plans for monitoring in the surgical department of Queens Hospital, were able to address this concern satisfactorily in their evidence.""}}"

There was no system for highlighting high clozapine results in the rio notes which are routinely used by all clinicians.\n \n4.       Understanding of clozapine: I heard evidence that there was a lack of understanding of when to measure clozapine levels, how to interpret high clozapine levels and then how to respond to a high level.\n \n5.       August 2020 Regulation 28 report: I sent a Regulation 28 report in August 2020 (case of Ian Allen) which identified that there was no system in place to ensure abnormal clozapine levels were escalated and acted upon and that there was a lack of understanding of the importance of clozapine monitoring and how frequently levels should be monitored. Given this report there is a concern that the Trust has not learnt from the previous Regulation 28 report.\n \n6.       Quality of the internal investigation process: The initial investigation report did not raise significant issues regarding the monitoring of clozapine and importantly whether Mr Hussain did in fact have toxicity. It was only when [REDACTED] wrote a report on 26/03/23 (7months after the death) that this issue was highlighted and addressed. This raises a concern about the quality of the internal investigation process and whether it is able to identify central issues in a particular case.\n \n7.

She complained of a 5-day history of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Raquel had a low oxygen saturation, a high respiratory rate and a tachycardia. The assessing doctor used the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC), to rule out the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism causing her symptoms. The PERC test was positive, and a D Dimer should have been carried out. This was not done. A diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was made, based upon a low haemoglobin and low MCV level. Raquel was admitted to hospital and suffered from periods of desaturation requiring medical review and assessment. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was not re-visited and further investigations, such as arterial blood gases were not carried out. In the very early hours of 25 June 2021, Raquel became critically unwell. She required escalation of her\r\ncare, but this was not provided until she was in a peri-arrest state at around 0330 on 25 June 2021. Raquel suffered a cardiac arrest at around 0400 and received resuscitation and thrombolysis.

She complained of a 5-day history of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Raquel had a low oxygen saturation, a high respiratory rate and a tachycardia. The assessing doctor used the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC), to rule out the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism causing her symptoms. The PERC test was positive, and a D Dimer should have been carried out. This was not done. A diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was made, based upon a low haemoglobin and low MCV level. Raquel was admitted to hospital and suffered from periods of desaturation requiring medical review and assessment. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was not re-visited and further investigations, such as arterial blood gases were not carried out. In the very early hours of 25 June 2021, Raquel became critically unwell. She required escalation of her\ncare, but this was not provided until she was in a peri-arrest state at around 0330 on 25 June 2021. Raquel suffered a cardiac arrest at around 0400 and received resuscitation and thrombolysis.

This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this ‘very urgent’ referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.\r\n \r\nb. During the evidence it was accepted that ‘a’ above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board’s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements.

https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/joseph-maunick-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,"{""circumstances"":{""old"":""Joseph Willy Maunick (Will) was an intelligent man, gifted with communication skills, who worked as a teacher and spoke multiple languages. In his later years he developed cognitive impairment, which in turn led to him being at very high risk of falls. This risk, in relation to which he needed constant supervision, was known to those caring for him and to those responsible for looking after him when he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was admitted to the hospital Emergency Department not because he himself was experiencing a medical emergency, but as a last resort after exhaustive efforts to explore all options before Will was admitted to hospital: it proved not to be possible to find suitable alternative care for him in residential care placements while his wife, and main carer, underwent unplanned emergency major surgery.\r\n \r\nThe inquest heard evidence that, prior to his admission to hospital, at least eight social care providers were contacted plus further residential homes, but none of them could provide emergency care for Will. The inquest heard undisputed evidence that this was an instance of a national care shortage.\r\n \r\nThe inquest heard evidence that in an Emergency Department where many patients are suffering medical emergencies constant one-to-one supervision will not always be possible. I found as a fact that it was not possible on this occasion and that Will’s fall in the Emergency Department took place when the nursing assistant who was trying to maintain constant one-to-one supervision of Will insofar as possible had their attention momentarily diverted to another patient experiencing a medical emergency. I judged that it would not be just to describe this as a failure on the part of the nursing assistant or the Emergency Department staff.\r\n \r\nThe reason why it was not an individual failure included that the inquest heard evidence that the hospital, and in particular the Emergency Department, was experiencing significant pressures associated with high demand and an internal critical incident had been declared. There was a high demand for beds within the hospital without the availability of beds to meet the demand. This included the facts that there were, at the time of Will’s arrival in the Emergency Department, 50 patients in the Emergency Department, of whom 32 were waiting for bed placement.

In his later years he developed cognitive impairment, which in turn led to him being at very high risk of falls. This risk, in relation to which he needed constant supervision, was known to those caring for him and to those responsible for looking after him when he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was admitted to the hospital Emergency Department not because he himself was experiencing a medical emergency, but as a last resort after exhaustive efforts to explore all options before Will was admitted to hospital: it proved not to be possible to find suitable alternative care for him in residential care placements while his wife, and main carer, underwent unplanned emergency major surgery.\n \nThe inquest heard evidence that, prior to his admission to hospital, at least eight social care providers were contacted plus further residential homes, but none of them could provide emergency care for Will. The inquest heard undisputed evidence that this was an instance of a national care shortage.\n \nThe inquest heard evidence that in an Emergency Department where many patients are suffering medical emergencies constant one-to-one supervision will not always be possible. I found as a fact that it was not possible on this occasion and that Will’s fall in the Emergency Department took place when the nursing assistant who was trying to maintain constant one-to-one supervision of Will insofar as possible had their attention momentarily diverted to another patient experiencing a medical emergency. I judged that it would not be just to describe this as a failure on the part of the nursing assistant or the Emergency Department staff.\n \nThe reason why it was not an individual failure included that the inquest heard evidence that the hospital, and in particular the Emergency Department, was experiencing significant pressures associated with high demand and an internal critical incident had been declared. There was a high demand for beds within the hospital without the availability of beds to meet the demand. This included the facts that there were, at the time of Will’s arrival in the Emergency Department, 50 patients in the Emergency Department, of whom 32 were waiting for bed placement. Moreover, staffing was at a ‘black status’ (the worst level) across the hospital, with a deficiency of staff of around 60 nurses and nursing assistants.\n \nI found as a fact that those severe pressures – the high demand levels and the deficiency of staff and scarcity of resource – contributed to the death. Firstly, if it had been possible to care for and supervise Will on a constant basis as he needed, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.\n \nSecondly, on the balance of probabilities, the scarcity of resource relative to demand contributed to Will not being transferred to a ward – or other more appropriate environment – sooner.\n \nApart from the inherent particular difficulties in providing constant supervision in an Emergency Department referred to above, the inquest also received undisputed evidence that the environment of a busy, noisy Emergency Department, with lights on at all hours of the day and night would be overly stimulating and not the most suitable environment for someone with cognitive impairment who was experiencing confusion and agitation.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (numbered separately in respect of each organisation, who are required to respond to each of the numbered paragraphs relating to them):\r\n \r\nWorcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust (WAHT)\r\n1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing care to Mr Mason (in both the emergency department and the surgical trauma department) appreciated that, as someone who had Addison’s disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.\r\n \r\n2)       The relevant internal Trust guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure-based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules, which are on the same page as advice to patients and families for long-term condition management) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.\r\n \r\n3)       Evidence heard at the inquest (relating to the trauma/surgical department at WAHT) suggested that it is likely that many clinicians (including at consultant level) do not have a well-developed understanding of adrenal insufficiency and the crucial importance of administering replacement steroid therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of suffering an adrenal crisis.\r\n \r\n4)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that no prompts exist on emergency department/clerking documentation at WAHT for clinicians to check whether a patient suffers\r\nfrom adrenal insufficiency.  Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included.\r\n \r\nWest Midlands Ambulance Service University NHS Foundation Trust (WMAS)\r\n1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing pre-hospital care to Mr Mason appreciated that, as someone who had Addison’s disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.\r\n \r\n2)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical steroid treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. Currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not being considered by call-handlers at WMAS.\r\n \r\n3)       The Serious Incident investigation report disclosed by WMAS did not make any recommendations in respect of improving clinicians’ knowledge of adrenal insufficiency and the importance of considering administering replacement steroid therapy.\r\n \r\n4)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the investigation lead at WMAS had not been shown the inquest disclosure bundle, which had been disclosed to the legal department at WMAS a number of months prior to the inquest. This bundle contained relevant evidence from a different internal investigation (by WAHT), suggesting that the likely cause of Mr Mason’s deterioration and death was an acute adrenal crisis and not, as had been considered when a coronial referral had initially been made, hyperkalaemia and rhabdomyolysis (following a fall and long lie). This lack of internal co-ordination within WMAS prevented full internal investigation and learning in respect of the care given to Mr Mason by WMAS. The legal department of WMAS did not attend the inquest (it was their right not to) nor were WMAS legally represented by an external solicitor or barrister (it was their right not to be). Greater engagement and participation in the coronial investigation and inquest process would improve the Trust’s ability to learn from patient-safety incidents and enable the legal, governance and safety departments to better co-ordinate such investigations.\r\n \r\nAssociation of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE)\r\n1) The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) places very little emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis, owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the ‘administer hydrocortisone’ box) is itself a sub-section of an ‘emergencies in adults and children’ box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are ‘unwell’ require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis – it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered ‘unwell’ in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro- intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.\r\n \r\n2) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical medical treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival).

Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. The pathway and programmed- logarithm should be looked at, as currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not able to be considered by ambulance service control centres.\r\n \r\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\r\n1) The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. It is my understanding that a new guideline in respect of managing the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is currently being developed by NICE. Consideration of these matters should be included as part of guideline development.\r\n \r\nSociety for Endocrinology (Clinical Committee)\r\n1)       The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. The clinical committee of the Society for Endocrinology has previously been involved in providing guidance in respect of managing patients with adrenal insufficiency. The Society’s input going forward is important in respect of considering any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.\r\n \r\n2)       The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) place very\r\nlittle emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress.

Currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not being considered by call-handlers at WMAS.\n \n3)       The Serious Incident investigation report disclosed by WMAS did not make any recommendations in respect of improving clinicians’ knowledge of adrenal insufficiency and the importance of considering administering replacement steroid therapy.\n \n4)       Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the investigation lead at WMAS had not been shown the inquest disclosure bundle, which had been disclosed to the legal department at WMAS a number of months prior to the inquest. This bundle contained relevant evidence from a different internal investigation (by WAHT), suggesting that the likely cause of Mr Mason’s deterioration and death was an acute adrenal crisis and not, as had been considered when a coronial referral had initially been made, hyperkalaemia and rhabdomyolysis (following a fall and long lie). This lack of internal co-ordination within WMAS prevented full internal investigation and learning in respect of the care given to Mr Mason by WMAS. The legal department of WMAS did not attend the inquest (it was their right not to) nor were WMAS legally represented by an external solicitor or barrister (it was their right not to be). Greater engagement and participation in the coronial investigation and inquest process would improve the Trust’s ability to learn from patient-safety incidents and enable the legal, governance and safety departments to better co-ordinate such investigations.\n \nAssociation of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE)\n1) The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) places very little emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis, owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the ‘administer hydrocortisone’ box) is itself a sub-section of an ‘emergencies in adults and children’ box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are ‘unwell’ require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis – it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered ‘unwell’ in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro- intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.\n \n2) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical medical treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. The pathway and programmed- logarithm should be looked at, as currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not able to be considered by ambulance service control centres.\n \nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)\n1) The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. It is my understanding that a new guideline in respect of managing the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is currently being developed by NICE. Consideration of these matters should be included as part of guideline development.\n \nSociety for Endocrinology (Clinical Committee)\n1)       The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT (‘Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults’) very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing ‘sick day’ rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. The clinical committee of the Society for Endocrinology has previously been involved in providing guidance in respect of managing patients with adrenal insufficiency. The Society’s input going forward is important in respect of considering any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.\n \n2)       The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) place very\nlittle emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the ‘administer hydrocortisone’ box) is itself a sub-section of an ‘emergencies in adults and children’ box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are ‘unwell’ require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis – it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that some of the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered ‘unwell’ in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.  The Society’s input going forward is important in respect of considering  any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.\n \nNHS England\n1)       Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison’s disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately.

Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included. It is not clear what follow-up action is taken by NHS England in relation to monitoring of compliance by NHS Trusts following National Patient Safety Alerts being issued.""},""response"":{""old"":""Your organisation is under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 June 2023.

During the inquest evidence was heard that:\r\ni. A patient, prescribed either antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, falling and sustaining a scalp laceration that is not “spurting or pouring blood” (the MPDS definition of “uncontrolled bleeding”), will never reach an MPDS disposition that results in a prioritisation higher than category 3, regardless of how long the bleeding has been persisting, unless the patient becomes unconscious or stops breathing. I heard evidence that the scalp is an area of high venous blood flow, such that a laceration to the scalp is capable of bleeding significantly. However, because of the nature of the blood supply in this area, the wound will not “spurt or pour” blood, so with the current iteration of MPDS a wound in this area of the body can never be considered as “serious haemorrhage”. Despite this, when assessing the seriousness of a bleed that does not meet the criteria for a “serious haemorrhage”, the MPDS algorithm does not allow for consideration of any delay in treatment or for the consideration of medications that may either exacerbate the extent of a bleed or prevent the blood from clotting to stop the bleed. For a patient such as Mr Adams, prescribed antiplatelet medication, there is a considerable risk that the bleeding will persist until the wound is closed, such that a delay in receiving treatment, where the wound continues to bleed, leaves the patient at risk of developing hypovolaemic shock."",""new"":""The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:\n1.

Furthermore, in those 2½ years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all.

The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.\r\n \r\nI am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.\r\n \r\n(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte’s referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate.

The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;\r\n \r\n2.     The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson’s time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;\r\n \r\n3.     Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson’s case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;\r\n \r\n4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising “silver trauma”. There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival."",""new"":""During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.\r\n \r\nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  \r\n1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred.\r\n \r\n1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  \r\n\r\n1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.\r\n \r\n1.3.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. \n  \nThe MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   \n1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. \n  \n1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic.  \n \n1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive (‘HSE’) indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.\n \n1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the ‘incident field’) had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence.

Whilst the Hull & East Yorkshire NHS Trust has taken steps to educate doctors about this power, these were only local measures and I believe that all doctors working in England and Wales should be aware of section 5(2) and nurses of their equivalent power pursuant to section 5(4) of the MHA 1983 and that appropriate awareness and training should be given.""},""action"":{""old"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you as Chief executive of NHS England have the power to take such action.\r\n \r\nTraining and highlighting of this important power should be regularly delivered to all doctors and nurses about their respective holding powers."",""new"":""In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you as Chief executive of NHS England have the power to take such action.\n \nTraining and highlighting of this important power should be regularly delivered to all doctors and nurses about their respective holding powers.""},""response"":{""old"":""You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 13th February 2023.
