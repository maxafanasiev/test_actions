pending,07/12/2023,2023-0523,Sarah Chappell,Mr Stephen Simblet KC,Assistant Coroner,London Inner North,Hospital Death (Clinical Procedures and medical management) related deaths,University College London Hospitals NHS Trust,1,0,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/sarah-chappell-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Sarah-Chappell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0523_Published.pdf,,Sarah Chappell was transferred to University College London Hospital from the Princess Royal University Hospital in Orpington on 31 May 2023. She remained at UCLH until her death on 23 June 2023.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
There was a ten day delay in Ms Chappell’s transfer from the Princess Royal Hospital to UCLH. I was told that this might have been because of a lack of beds, but it might also have been because of confusion about which UCLH site was the accepting surgeon’s preferred destination, a confusion that was understood at the time by the Princess Royal to be a rejection of the transfer.
 
From at least 16 June 2023, the consultant urology surgeon in charge of Ms Chappell’s care was very firmly of the view that he was not the best clinician to fulfil this role. He had long since correctly determined that she had not sustained a ruptured bladder, and thus considered that her care belonged with the gastroenterologists or the general surgeons.
 
Despite the agreement on 16 June of the gastroenterology clinical director that Ms Chappell’s care should be led by the gastroenterologists, they had not taken over her care by the time of her death, and there had not even been a conversation between the gastroenterology and general surgery consultants about the transfer of care.
 
There was a frequent misunderstanding among the medical staff that Ms Chappell’s issues were all chronic. Her acute situation was often not properly handed over or understood by her consultants.","On 4 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sarah Chappell, aged 43 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today. I made a determination as follows.   ","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5 February 2024. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

He had spent most of his adult life in psychiatric hospital and had a recent history of self harm in that he had attempted to hang himself [REDACTED] on 20th May 2020 before finally succeeding in carrying out the exact same act on 31st July 2020 which this time resulted in his death. Mr Perrott was on 15 minute observations at the time of his death but these were not recorded and no one noticed he was missing until 15 minutes after his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Despite the Trust having prepared a detailed report and addendum for my consideration after the inquest I am still concerned about the following :
Paul Perrott’s observations charts were not filled out adequately or at all on the date of his death
There appeared to be a lack of clarity over who was responsible for checking the observation charts ,when they would be checked by staff over the course of a working day and who would regularly feed back to staff if there was a problem in this respect .
At least one member of staff was unaware that Paul had described himself to staff in May 2020 as looking for an opportunity to take his own life if it arose and that Paul had attempted to take his own life less than 3 months previously in exactly the same way as on 31st July 2020.
(4 ) Although certain changes to policy and procedures were described to me there still seems to be a focus on risk in the “here and now “which does not
include an analysis of historical and contextual risks","On 7th August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Paul Perrott , age 34 The investigation concluded at the end of a jury inquest on 17th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide but the jury answered a number of questions which raised concern over the level of observations and care given to Paul during his time on Ashcombe Ward.","Although there have already been changes made to polices and procedures in the hospital arising out of this death action should be taken:
– To review the procedures in place on the wards to ensure that observation charts are regularly checked by ward management and concerns feedback to staff quickly and appropriately
– To ensure that staff members are required and able to easily familiarise themselves with the full history in relation to each patient they care for as opposed to simply being made aware of any risks that present on the day which may not take account of historical or contextual risk .
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5th February 2024 .

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The evidence I heard was that a Joint Operating Protocol between the North West Ambulance Service and the five regional police forces designed to address the issues of which emergency service should take responsibility for incidents involving drug overdoses and the method by which the police officers attending such incidents prior to the arrival of the ambulance service can escalate their concerns over a person suspected to have taken a drug overdose, was in an advanced stage of completion, but was stalled in July 2022.
 
Whilst I heard that discussions have recently recommenced, they now encompass the Right Care, Right Person model, the findings of the Manchester Arena Bombing Enquiry and that additionally, the Fire and Rescue Service and the British Transport Police have now become involved.
 
Pending agreement of a Joint Operating Protocol, there does not appear to be any consistent and reliable understanding in place across the police forces and the North West Ambulance Service to provide clarity as to the roles of the respective services and the method by which concerns about individual patients can be escalated to the ambulance service by police officers dealing with those who are suspected to have taken drug overdoses.","On 29th November 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Claire Nicole Briggs, aged 42 years.

There were 2 admitted failings by the North West Ambulance Service effectively to conduct clinical reviews of the incident which were not in themselves causative of her death, but the combined effect of those failings, the absence of any method within the NHS Pathways system to identify high risk overdoses and the pressures on the deployment of ambulances on that day combined to lead to a delay in her arrival at hospital which possibly contributed to her death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2nd February 2024.

On 3rd November he was found by the GP to have a distended abdomen and was referred on the two-week cancer pathway. CT scans found a mass in his bowel. Biopsies were initially inconclusive for cancer. A PET scan on 8th February confirmed advanced colorectal cancer. A stoma was inserted laparoscopically on 14th February to assist with his bowel symptoms. He was not seen for chemotherapy consideration until 6th March 2023. His health had deteriorated significantly since his referral on the cancer pathway and his suitability for chemotherapy was borderline. The plan was to start it around 17th March. In the period he developed spinal cord compression and received radiotherapy which was given on 21st March. He continued to deteriorate with the cancer having spread into his brain. Chemotherapy was not started until 4th April 2023.He deteriorated rapidly with the cancer having spread aggressively. He died at Stamford Court on 28th April 2023.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
The inquest heard evidence that a national shortage of specialist scanning facilities such as was required in Mr Williams’ case meant that there were delays nationally with the diagnosis of cancers. This in turn led to delays in treatment and poorer outcomes for cancer patients as delays in diagnosis meant that the cancer would often have advanced further, and treatment was less likely to be successful. This was compounded by the fact that additional complications such as cord compression could arise whilst a scan was awaited and that the patient would be less able to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy when it ultimately started.
 
The inquest also heard evidence that there were significant delays nationally in compliance with the two-week cancer pathway which led to poorer outcomes for patients as any delay in treatment reduced the likelihood of a successful outcome.
 
Evidence was also heard that the delay Mr Williams faced between diagnosis and being seen for a plan to be developed was also part of a wider national picture of delay in accessing cancer treatments and again reduced the chances of a successful treatment outcome.",On 3rd May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony Eric Williams.

The occupier of the private dwelling gave evidence that he and his wife were advised by the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust, during the course of the 999 call, to fetch a nearby community public access defibrillator from the Co-op store, 29 Doncaster Road, Carlton-in-Lindrick, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, S81 9JX.
 
The device was provided to the occupier by co-op staff. When the occupier arrived at Mackenzie’s side and opened the defibrillator pack, the audible instructions advised that the pads should be connected to the leads. On exploring the entirety of the device pack, it became apparent there were no pads, meaning the device could not be used. This delayed the use of a defibrillator, and the administration of a shock, if Mackenzie was in a shockable rhythm.
 
When the occupier later returned the device to the Co-op store, staff informed them that they knew the device was missing the pads because they had not been replaced since the device was last used.
 
I received evidence from East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust that responsibility for maintaining the defibrillator device and associated equipment, including replacement pads, rests with the “guardian” of the device, not with the with the ambulance service. The ambulance service simply has access to a list of the locations of community pubic access defibrillators and advise callers of their nearest device in a cardiac arrest scenario.
 
I understand there were other community access defibrillators very close by which the occupier could have accessed if the ambulance service had known the device in the co-op store was “offline”.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1.       Alex was not referred by school to NHS mental health services as a result of their experience that if Alex was in receipt of any other support he would not be accepted onto the waiting list (which would be in excess of 10 months to be seen).
2.       The school chose to provide Alex with school procured psychology support however the process of allocation of provision was not clear.
The school did not have a clear communication process with the provider of support to either refer the student into services or to receive outputs from those services once the student completed their sessions",On 21 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alex Dews born on 7 November 2008. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was:   ,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action. I would ask that your responses specifically consider the following:-
 
Department of Health and Social Care
Part of the challenge for the school was the decision about whether to obtain quick support for Alex through their counselling provision or whether to place Alex on a long waiting list for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services. They were not able to offer both as he would be removed from NHS services if he was receiving other service.
The provision of services for children and young people experiencing mental health difficulties carries long waiting lists and mitigation cannot be implemented where they will be removed from the waiting list for having that in place.
 
Department of Education
 
The provision of support services in school is not clear and consistent. The school in Alex’s case had to put in place their own provision as the Local procurement was delayed. In any event there is a lack of clarity around what should be in place in school in terms of counselling for those who may be transgender or questioning their identity or whether this is solely a role for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services.
 
Outwood Academy

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1.       Alex was not referred by school to NHS mental health services as a result of their experience that if Alex was in receipt of any other support he would not be accepted onto the waiting list (which would be in excess of 10 months to be seen).
2.       The school chose to provide Alex with school procured psychology support however the process of allocation of provision was not clear.
The school did not have a clear communication process with the provider of support to either refer the student into services or to receive outputs from those services once the student completed their sessions",On 21 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alex Dews born on 7 November 2008. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 September 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was:   ,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action. I would ask that your responses specifically consider the following:-
 
Department of Health and Social Care
Part of the challenge for the school was the decision about whether to obtain quick support for Alex through their counselling provision or whether to place Alex on a long waiting list for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services. They were not able to offer both as he would be removed from NHS services if he was receiving other service.
The provision of services for children and young people experiencing mental health difficulties carries long waiting lists and mitigation cannot be implemented where they will be removed from the waiting list for having that in place.
 
Department of Education
 
The provision of support services in school is not clear and consistent. The school in Alex’s case had to put in place their own provision as the Local procurement was delayed. In any event there is a lack of clarity around what should be in place in school in terms of counselling for those who may be transgender or questioning their identity or whether this is solely a role for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services.
 
Outwood Academy
 
The school did not have clear objective referral documentation in place for someone in Alex’s position which would assist with consistency of decision making. The school also did not have clear guidance from the psychology provider about what concerns may have been raised during counselling or what steps the school could take to support Alex following his sessions.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1.  Upon RA’s arrival back at the Nursing Home on 2nd August, staff immediately raised a Safeguarding concern in respect of, inter alia, his genitals being covered in a white “cheese” like substance with, additionally, faecal matter in his pubic hair; extensive areas of flaking skin including behind his ears was also identified. Colour photographs were taken and provided to the Trust along with the Safeguarding documentation. Objectively, the photographs clearly documented the flaking skin and white “cheese” like material covering RA’s penis.
 
2.  Evidence confirmed that the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, responsible for Basildon Hospital, carried out a significantly flawed RCA investigation which effectively rejected any suggestions of shortcoming in care, management and treatment. The Ward Matron (responsible for the ward concerned) was the co-author responsible for the RCA Report. [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest that she had not been provided with the photographs provided by the Nursing Home and RA’s daughter until just two weeks prior to the inquest hearing.  (It was noted and accepted that even when [REDACTED] had seen the photographs neither nor the Trust had seen fit to draw this to HMC’s attention or to provide either an addendum statement or a revised RCA).
 
3. The Trust’s responsible Adult Safeguarding Lead provided a statement in which [REDACTED] confirmed that, notwithstanding the photos having been expressly noted in the original Safeguarding referral and raised in subsequent correspondence and meetings with the Thurrock Local Authority Safeguarding Team, [REDACTED] had not made the photos available for the purposes of the RCA. [REDACTED] was unable to provide any explanation at all for this failure. This lack of professionalism was and remains a grave cause for concern resulting as it did in a seriously flawed Trust investigation, which itself fed into the Thurrock Adult Safeguarding investigation and, further still, a wider section 42 systemic investigation involving RA’s case and two others to which a range of stakeholders contributed. It was accepted by the Trust witnesses that but for the coronial investigation, the denials of any Trust failings would have remained unchallenged perpetuating a false record of the basic nursing care provided (or not provided) to the highly vulnerable and dependent RA.
 
4. The evidence heard at the inquest undermined the following erroneous findings of the RCA:
·  In response to the concern that RA had extensive flakes of fungal growth behind his ears the RCA concluded that “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation supports regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”
 
·  In respect to the concern that RA’s foreskin/genitals were covered in flakes and what appeared to be “cheese / paste” the RCA asserted that there were “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation support regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”","On 3rd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ronald Scott Ashdown, aged 55 years.

He had been diagnosed with treatment resistant schizophrenia and depression and had been under the care of Mental health team since 1997. He was established on clozapine in 2004 which requires monthly monitoring due to its potential toxic effects. His clozapine level was 904 ug/L on 03/05/22. ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.       Monitoring clozapine levels: The inquest heard evidence that there was a clear system to monitor monthly blood test results looking for low white cell count, however there was no clear system for monitoring the actual clozapine and nor clozapine levels. In addition the inquest heard how there was no safe system to communicate high levels of clozapine.
 
2.       Medication changes: After a review on 14/10/22, when a high level of clozapine was noted from a blood test on 03/05/22, the consultant indicated that medication should reduce on the next prescription. This was communicated by email to the care coordinator however this was not read or acted upon. The inquest heard how there was no safe system to effect medication changes.
 
3.       How to record high clozapine levels: The clozapine and nor clozapine levels are recorded in the pharmacy section of the records. There was no system for highlighting high clozapine results in the rio notes which are routinely used by all clinicians.
 
4.       Understanding of clozapine: I heard evidence that there was a lack of understanding of when to measure clozapine levels, how to interpret high clozapine levels and then how to respond to a high level.
 
5.       August 2020 Regulation 28 report: I sent a Regulation 28 report in August 2020 (case of Ian Allen) which identified that there was no system in place to ensure abnormal clozapine levels were escalated and acted upon and that there was a lack of understanding of the importance of clozapine monitoring and how frequently levels should be monitored. Given this report there is a concern that the Trust has not learnt from the previous Regulation 28 report.
 
6.       Quality of the internal investigation process: The initial investigation report did not raise significant issues regarding the monitoring of clozapine and importantly whether Mr Hussain did in fact have toxicity. It was only when [REDACTED] wrote a report on 26/03/23 (7months after the death) that this issue was highlighted and addressed. This raises a concern about the quality of the internal investigation process and whether it is able to identify central issues in a particular case.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Preamble 
During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashton’s gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time.
 
During the ‘relevant period’ examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton’s death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as ‘player protection tools’, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him.
 
Concerns
1)    I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler.
 
2)     I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally.
 
3)     I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers.",On 06 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Luke Anthony Ashton aged 40. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 June 2023. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Tuesday 5th September 2023.

She was operated on for a fracture to the neck of femur. Post-operatively she developed pneumonia. Subsequently the wound became infected, and a wound wash and debridement took place. She became increasingly frail. She was discharged home with support from the discharge to assess team. She felt unwell on 13th December 2022 and called for an ambulance with chest pains. Her initial call was dealt with as a category 5 call, and she contacted her GP. Her GP visited her and was concerned about her presentation. A further call to the ambulance service resulted in her being classified as a category 2 call. The blood tests taken indicated she was in severe heart failure and at a risk of a myocardial infarction. The ambulance arrived significantly outside the target Department of Health response times. The ambulance crew identified she needed urgent cardiac treatment and she was for transfer to hospital. Enroute to hospital she deteriorated further and died in the ambulance from complications of heart failure.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
 
The inquest heard evidence that under the Department of Health’s Ambulance Response time criteria, a category 2 call should have an average response time of 18 minutes and be within 40 minutes in 9 out of 10 cases.
 
The evidence before the inquest was that in her case the response time on the category 2 call was 1 hour and 5 minutes – significantly outside the target time. A response within the target time would have meant that she would not have deteriorated and died in the ambulance. She would have been in a hospital with access to treatment available in such a setting.
 
The evidence before the inquest was that her case was not a one off and delays of this nature had been occurring throughout the day. The mean time for Category 2 response times that day was 1 hour and 22 minutes and the 90th percentile was just over 3 hours.
 
At 17.58 that day there were 142 emergencies waiting in Greater Manchester alone and 430 across the North West. The average response time at that point for Category 2 patients was 2 hours and 33 minutes.
The inquest heard that the cause of these significant delays in patients receiving care in a timely manner was multifactorial and included the demand for ambulances across Greater Manchester and the North West and the long ambulance delays at A and E departments due to the demand on A and E services.",On 19th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joan Mary Corcoran. The investigation concluded on the 15th May 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15th August 2023.

She complained of a 5-day history of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Raquel had a low oxygen saturation, a high respiratory rate and a tachycardia. The assessing doctor used the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC), to rule out the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism causing her symptoms. The PERC test was positive, and a D Dimer should have been carried out. This was not done. A diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was made, based upon a low haemoglobin and low MCV level. Raquel was admitted to hospital and suffered from periods of desaturation requiring medical review and assessment. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was not re-visited and further investigations, such as arterial blood gases were not carried out. In the very early hours of 25 June 2021, Raquel became critically unwell. She required escalation of her
care, but this was not provided until she was in a peri-arrest state at around 0330 on 25 June 2021. Raquel suffered a cardiac arrest at around 0400 and received resuscitation and thrombolysis. Sadly, there was no response to the emergency efforts and Raquel passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on 25 June 2021. Had Raquel received the D Dimer test on the 23 June 2021, in accordance with the Trust’s policy, this is likely to have triggered further investigations which would have resulted in a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and a treatment dose of lower molecular weight heparin. On the balance of probabilities this would have prevented Raquel’s death on the 25 June 2021.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1. There was a lack of thorough history taking and a number of assumptions were made on the basis of Raquel’s high BMI. There was an assumed chronic low oxygen saturation with no evidence that the doctors had checked the records available or asked the patient about her baseline. The oxygen saturations recorded in the Barts sleep apnoea clinic in 2015 and 2016 were noted to be 99% and 100%.
 
2. There was a lack of escalation of monitoring following the NEWS score of 10. It is of concern that the NEWS policy was not complied with by the nursing staff.
 
There was disagreement between senior clinicians as to how the Trust’s PE policy should have been applied. The policy is often not used in accordance with the specific wording. For example, the requirement for pleuritic chest pain is often ignored in practice. A senior clinician within the Trust considered that the caveat for pleuritic chest pain in the policy should be reviewed. In addition, the senior clinician described some of the wording in the policy as “clumsy”. In light of this, the Trust may wish to review the policy.","On the 26th July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raquel Mellonie Harper, aged 33 years.

Eifion Wyn Huws was aged 63 at the time of his death on 10 June 2022. He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter’s home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter’s home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.      a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion’s GP had made a ‘very
urgent’ referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this ‘very urgent’ referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.
 
b. During the evidence it was accepted that ‘a’ above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board’s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.
 
An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion’s death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner.","On 21 June 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Eifion Wyn Huws (DOB 25/4/59) who died on 10 June 2022.

This failure made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to Jess’ death on 14 May 2021.’",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 July 2023.

Mr Seaby was assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist [“SALT”]. A SALT Care Plan was in place with regard to his nutrition which included specific requirements that he be given only soft, moist and mashed food, with two specific exceptions and that he was to be supervised throughout meals on a one-to-one basis with a ten minute gap between food and drink and for ten minutes afterwards. The Care Plan stated it was “essential” the Plan was adhered to and specifically provided that if the requirements were not adhered to, Mr Seaby was at risk of aspiration and asphyxiation “which are potentially life threatening”. Evidence was heard that Mr Seaby was not always given food which complied with the Care Plan and he was not always provided with supervision in compliance with his Care Plan. On 21 May 2018, Mr Seaby’s food at lunchtime was not prepared in accordance with the SALT Care Plan.  Mr Seaby was not provided with the required one to one supervision during the lunchtime meal. During lunch Mr Seaby coughed while eating and brought some food back up. He cleared his throat and then appeared fine and finished the rest of his meal. At afternoon snack Mr Seaby brought up large amounts of phlegm and then coughed up anything he ate or drank. Mr Seaby was taken to see the General Practitioner by a member of staff who had not been with Mr Seaby during that day. No copy of Mr Seaby’s Daily Record was shown to the General Practitioner. Mr Seaby was given a working diagnosis of gastric reflux and his medication was changed. At teatime, Mr Seaby coughed/vomited his medication and yoghurt and drink. Mr Seaby vomited phlegm on two more occasions. The 111 service was called at 20.53 hours.
The out of hours Doctor was spoken to at 22.45 hours following which emergency services were contacted and Mr Seaby was taken to Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital where he died on 22 May 2018.

Many steps have been taken in the period following Mr Seaby’s death. However there remain areas of concern
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. Evidence was heard at the inquest of the “informal approach” taken with regard to arrangements as to who would provide supervision of residents, including on a one to one basis and who would cook and prepare their meals, including those residents who were subject to a specific SALT dietary plan. Evidence was also heard of steps which have been put in place since Mr Seaby’s death to provide written staff rotas for such matters, prepared by Team Leaders and Deputy Managers. However, despite these steps being taken, evidence was also heard at the inquest from staff, who continue to provide care at Oaks and Woodcroft Care Home, referring to providing care on an “informal basis” and that this “works”.",On 06 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Gary SEABY aged 63.

They outlined that approximately 15 metres from where Mr Easdale crossed the road, there was a traffic island (or pedestrian refuge) with a bollard and streetlamp in place. The bollard on the island is made out of opaque white plastic and is designed to be illuminated from within. The time of the collision was around 5pm on a December afternoon meaning that this stretch of road was in deep darkness.
 
When the collision occurred on the 5th November 2021, neither the illuminated bollard nor the streetlamp were in working order and were therefore unlit. Both officers from the collision unit gave evidence that this situation presented a danger to road users and pedestrians.
 
A Traffic Management Officer has brought this situation to the attention of Hertfordshire County Council, Highways England (now National Highways) and National Power Networks (now UK Power Networks).
 
Despite this, I heard evidence at the inquest that both the bollard and the streetlamp have still not been repaired and remain unlit even in the hours of darkness.
 
I was not able to say on the balance of probabilities that the lack of lighting on the pedestrian island
contributed to Mr Easdale’s death as he was not using the crossing itself when he was struck. He crossed nearby, however, and it is possible that had there been illumination at that island the driver of the car would have seen him earlier and potentially avoided the collision.
 
I am satisfied that the lack of working lights at this location on the B197 Digswell Hill poses a danger to road users and pedestrians. The location of the island is near to the Red Lion Public House and may be used by people going to and from the pub.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

She went to a hospital in Bali where she deteriorated and died on the 24th July 2022 despite treatment. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. It was found that she had methanol in her system which had caused her death. Methanol is not meant for human consumption. She had inadvertently consumed methanol believing she had consumed alcohol.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The Inquest heard evidence that there is a growing problem of methanol being passed off as alcohol for human consumption particularly in places such as Bali. Methanol is used rather than ethanol in spirits aimed at the Western market and sold even through apparently reputable suppliers.
 
The evidence before the Inquest was that :
1.  Knowledge of the problem amongst the expatriate/tourist community was very low despite the increase in the problem and the catastrophic consequences of methanol consumption;
 
2.  There was little publicity by the UK Government of the risk in contrast to the approach taken by the Australian Government who had undertaken a campaign to increase awareness to protect their citizens travelling in areas of Asia such as Bali;
 
3.  The UK Government publicising information about the risk of methanol being used in local spirits, steps that could be taken by UK nationals travelling to reduce the risk and warning signs of methanol toxicity would help to reduce the chance of others dying in the way in which Kirsty McKie died",On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Margaret McKie. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 1st April 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Sean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.
The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.
Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter [REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.
Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was [REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed – incorrectly – single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Sean’s access had been restricted she would not, I am
certain, have allowed him entry.","On 10 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sean Gerard DUIGNAN aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
 
Sean Gerard Duignan was a well respected, well liked and universally helpful base sergeant at the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit (South Base). On the 29th May 2021 he was arrested following reports of a vehicle being driven erratically and dangerously. A Bedfordshire Police sergeant visited him at his home to conduct what was initially to be a welfare check. Sean was intoxicated with alcohol and was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of drink or drug driving. He remained in custody until the following afternoon when he was released under investigations. Multiple and serial enquiries were made by members of the custody and health care staff at Milton Keynes Police Custody suite to determine his mental health and to keep him safe. Those checks were repeated on release. They were continued by the police federation representatives and his close friend [REDACTED]. All seemed well. The next day, a day off, Sean travelled to the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit where the South Base armoury is located. The armoury security was lax and had been for a prolonged period. The computer system used for electronic access was repeatedly failing but seemingly no coherent approach was taken to remedy this. The back up master armoury key was kept in a PIN protected locked box, but the PIN number was universally known. Because of an error in the computerised system an officer was allocated single point access when she should not have been. She unwittingly let Sean, whose own access to the armoury had been restricted without his colleagues being informed, into the armoury. He took a hand gun and ammunition, entered the base gym and shot himself in the head.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 13, 2023.

1. That the HQIP should consider undertaking in liaison with the BTS a further review and audit in relation to delivering a recurrent national audit of emergency oxygen.
This update will also be able to use learning from recent clinical practice (including the Covid pandemic) and the developments in treatment.
2.     Formulate any new guidelines and recommend any necessary changes to try and improve national practice.
3.     The HQIP could encourage all NHS Trusts to use the BTS audit tools to evaluate its data and performance now, pending a future national audit.
4.     The BTS have already issued guidance for passengers travelling with respiratory conditions; namely, the BTS Clinical Statement on air travel for passengers with respiratory disease (https://thorax.bmj.com/content/77/4/329). However, this guidance does not cover trauma, as in this case.
