Her separation anxiety had become so severe that it also began to impact her husband and his ability to leave her alone for any significant length of time and carry out his own work. She saw her GP on 16 and 30 June, and on 30 June she was referred to the Crisis Response Team. On both 5 and 8 July, she left a note for her family and took a taxi to a train station and multi-storey car park respectively. On each of those occasions, Nadia was found by police and taken to hospital. From 10 July she received specialist in-patient care at the Peter Bruff Unit, before being discharged home on 17 July under the care of the Crisis Home Treatment Team, who attended upon her either in person or virtually until 25 July. From 23 July she began to reach out to other professional colleagues (she had been a counsellor herself) via text message and email and made desperate pleas for help, to such an extent that one of these professionals called the police. On 26 July she recorded a video message for her daughter and left a handwritten note for her husband and daughter. She took sleeping tablets and appeared to have drunk some wine as well. When her husband returned home that evening, he found her hanging [REDACTED]. A post-mortem examination confirmed the medical cause of death to be; 1a Hanging. The toxicology report was consistent with medication that Nadia had been taking, both prescribed and over the counter remedies.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
Failure to update Nadia’s records with the outcomes of referrals that were made and whether such referrals were accepted or declined, either for Nadia or her carer.
Failure to include within her records considerations and professional opinions reached on the prospect, or not, of readmission for in-patient treatment together with the final decision and rationale.
Lack of bespoke care plans tailored to Nadia’s needs. Notwithstanding the fact Nadia had begun to disengage and declined to be involved in her care planning, more personalised plans could have been drafted taking into account her personal characteristics, needs and past medical history.
Evidence of “cutting and pasting” into Nadia’s care plan from another patient’s care plan.
Failing to undertake risk assessments at all relevant and appropriate stages and/or failure to record that such an assessment had in fact taken place and what the outcome was.
Failing to provide a “RAG” rating to risk assessments and/or to indicate where required that a risk exists.
Failure to include risk management and contingency planning within Nadia’s care plans as well as key elements of her condition at that time, including her recent inpatient admission.
The potential for over-reliance on Nadia’s husband, albeit he was only too willing to support her and care for her, and the need to balance maintaining Nadia’s care and treatment in the community with the need to support her carer as well.","On 4 August 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nadia Wyatt, 53.

A chest x-ray was performed on 29 November 2022 which showed right upper lobe pneumonia and some pleural effusion. Iona was escalated from high-flow nasal cannula oxygen to continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”).   Iona continued to receive antibiotics and her condition appeared to improve. On 30 November 2022 she was stepped down from high-dependency care.   ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Following Iona’s death, the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust conducted a Serious Incident Investigation. One of the recommendations made by the investigation panel was:
 
“Children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should be suspected of having a pleural effusion and should get an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”
 
That recommendation reflected advice provided on 29th November 2022 (the day after Iona’s admission to Northampton General Hospital) by the East Midlands Paediatric Critical Care Network:
 
“We would like to inform you of a high number of cases of highly aggressive sepsis, linked to empyema, and positive culture for Group A Streptococcus in the region. This has caused significant morbidity and mortality.
We advise early referral, aggressive management, high dose intravenous antibiotics, and early drainage of empyemas.
Please have a low threshold for investigating any child with a secondary respiratory deterioration, especially with new onset of fever. Chest X-Ray and ultrasound will be beneficial.”
 
At the inquest into Iona’s death, I heard evidence from the Trust’s Clinical Director of the Child Health Directorate who is also a Consultant Paediatrician.
 
On the basis of the evidence I heard from the Clinical Director, I am satisfied that the Trust has taken action in respect of the recommendations made and more broadly have reflected upon the circumstances of Iona’s death. However, in respect of the recommendation set out above, I am concerned that there remains a risk that future deaths could occur unless further action is taken.
 
The recommendation made by the investigation panel was that children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should get “an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”. However, the evidence I heard suggests this is not possible.
 
I heard from the Clinical Director that as a district general hospital, Northampton General Hospital does not have access to a paediatric radiologist outside of 9am-5pm on Mondays and Fridays when such a specialist is either on duty or on-call. I heard evidence that in Iona’s case, a Consultant in ITU and Anaesthesia was able to perform an ultrasound scan at around 2pm on 4th December 2022 however this is not a facility that would routinely be available to the Trust and was not, in any event, part of that clinician’s core duties.
 
I am concerned that a very unwell child who may require a chest ultrasound may not receive one ‘immediately’ and in fact may have to wait for a considerable period of time. For example, if the need arose over a weekend, that child may not receive an ultrasound scan for up to 48 hours.","On 14th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Iona Grace Buckingham, aged 9 months.

The debilitating affects of her condition had also negatively impacted on her mental health and she suffered from periodic bouts of low mood and depression for which she was prescribed medication to help alleviate the symptoms.   ,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The provision to Ms. MITCHELL of 28 days’ worth of prescribed medication in less than a 48-hour period (14 days’ worth of medication dispensed on each occasion she was discharged hospital on the 3rd and 4th of August 2022). This occurred at a time when, due to concerns about Ms. MITCHELL hoarding medication and taking an overdose, she was receiving weekly medication prescriptions from her GP to control this risk.
 
The evidence heard at Inquest indicated that there was no process in place whereby accident and emergency staff could access Ms. MITCHELL’s medical records detailing the medication she was receiving and the rationale behind the dispensing regime in place.",On 07 October 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sarah Julie MITCHELL aged 41.

A member of staff was with him. On arrival he was triaged at 11:01 and assessed by a physician associate at 13:34. This was reviewed by the Emergency Medicine Consultant and a diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction was made based on the clinical assessment and x- ray of the abdomen which showed distended bowel loops. He was deemed stable and was referred to the nurse co-ordinator on the Surgical Assessment Unit (SAU) at 14:30. Evidence was provided at the inquest that the NELA (National emergency laparotomy audit) risk of death score was 2.3% at this time of referral.
 
Crucially no CT scan was undertaken which would have provided better resolution and information on the presenting condition. Evidence was given at the inquest that this would form basic medical treatment for an acute intestinal obstruction and consideration of an abdominal emergency laparotomy. Later under examination from the trust representative, the witness recanted slightly on this stating that more junior doctors may not be minded to seek a CT scan, and commented surprisingly that requesting a scan by a consultant in the Emergency department could not be guaranteed.
 
I received evidence in the form of the serious incident report that there were nursing shortages on that day and that the department was under considerable pressure. No surgical referral had been made. Concerns were raised that observations were not completed on time and I heard evidence from family members that their concerns about Karmchand and the pain he was suffering were not taken on board by staff. The SI report noted that there were difficulties in assessing his condition due to his mental health difficulties meaning that he could not express pain to staff as easily. His family and staff who knew him raised concerns, but adequate notice does not appear to have been taken..
 
At 20:30 Karmchand Deteriorated with decreasing level of consciousness and oxygen saturations and was escalated to the ED registrar and transferred to the resuscitation area where he was intubated and taken for CT scan at 22:00. The CT scan demonstrated dilated large bowel and a decision was taken for him to have urgent surgery
 
The delay in seeking a CT scan, which did not occur until that evening meant that surgery to treat the bowel distention only occurred much later into the evening and into the early morning of 24 September 2022. By this time, the NELA risk assessment had increased from 2.3% to 52% in other words, death was more likely to occur at that point of surgery than earlier in the day.
 
Mr Gulzar died during surgery in the early hours of 24 September 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Karmchand was referred to the surgical nursing team instead of the surgical registrar or surgical on-call team, as required by the Emergency Department to surgical registrar referral pathway from a previous SI where it had been identified as an issue. This was not followed in this case, leading to a delay in surgery and increased risk of death. I am concerned that the surgical registrar referral pathway is not being utilised despite previous incidents in which its use was highlighted as necessary.
 
No CT scan was undertaken as required by the acute abdominal pathway and guidance as part of the initial assessment. I was concerned by evidence that a CT scan would not be undertaken urgently as part of an acute abdominal presentation and that the necessity for a scan may not be known by junior (or some consultant) doctors.
 
The deterioration in Karmchand’s condition was not recognised due to difficulties in communication of pain due to his mental health condition. Concerns raised by his carers and family who knew him best and his presentation were not given adequate weight. A previous SI was reported to have raised this issue, but no action point or plan was provided in the current report to set out how staff could improve the assessment of patients with communication difficulties, by using observations and relying on people
who better knew their demeanour and presentation.","On 26 September 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death
of Karmchand GULZAR. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 December 2023. The findings and conclusion of the inquest were
 
Mr Karmchand Gulzar died at Sandwell hospital on 24 September 2022 during the course of an emergency operation to treat dilated large bowel. There had been a delay in obtaining a CT scan which showed the extent of the condition, meaning that the prospects of surviving surgery had reduced significantly by the time of the operation. Other warning signs of the significance of the surgical abdomen obstruction were not noted including a lactate level of 5 showing that Mr Gulzar was deteriorating. An immediate surgical review was not undertaken. These matters contributed more than minimally to Mr Gulzar’s death.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The evidence revealed that from at least 2019, Kimberly Liu had regularly accessed websites specifically aimed at selling prescription-only medications (predominantly medications with a sedative effect) that allowed repeat orders on the same day and did not require a prescription. Those websites included the following:
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
[REDACTED]
 
Despite the different URLs some of the websites appear to be operated by the same company and/or individual(s), in that ordering using an identical WhatsApp number ([REDACTED]) was also permitted.
 
Correspondence from the websites, following an order being placed, included messaging that suggested that the operator(s) knew that their supply of such medication was likely to arouse regulatory suspicion. By way of example, messaging received in emails following the placing of an order, included the following:
 
‘This is to inform you that usage of the name “Sleeping Tablets” during the payment at the banks is prohibited. Kindly do not use the brand name as it can be harmful for us.’
 
‘DO NOT MENTION THE PRODUCT OR WEBSITE WHEN MAKING PAYMENT.’
 
On one occasion in December 2021, the same website [REDACTED]
 permitted identical orders of [REDACTED] tablets within nine minutes of each other, without question or checks. Three days later a further order of
was again permitted without any query.
 
The concern here is that these websites, and potentially other similar websites, are not only operating without regulation, but that they appear to exploit already vulnerable individuals by facilitating an almost unseen feeding of dangerous medication addictions thereby placing those individuals in grave danger.
 
Although the inquest I heard did not concern a death by suicide, the additional concern is that these websites could also be seen to equip people with the means to complete suicide.
 
I believe that consideration ought to be given to the impact that the availability of such websites has on the population at large, together with the significantly increased risks to those who have developed an addiction to such medications or may even be contemplating acts of self-harm. I also believe that consideration ought to be given to whether and what action(s) could be taken to remove or limit access to or the availability of such websites.","On 17 February 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of KIMBERLY ANNA LIU, then aged 40 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
A thematic review completed in November 2021 had identified a number of significant issues in the functioning of mental health services, and many of the same issues were also identified in the serious incident review into Linda’s care and treatment, from February 2022 until her death. It is apparent that any actions taken as a result of the thematic review were not effective in implementing change and that the action plan was still a “work in progress” at the Pre Hearing Review Hearings which took place in this case in 2023.
The Serious Incident Investigation into the care received by Linda was not completed until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after the death. This is neither timely nor responsive. Despite reassurances given that the Trust are working to eradicate such delays, in response to a series of previous PFD reports issued by the Coroners of Durham and Darlington, there are still cases coming to the attention of the Coronial service where Serious Incident Investigations are significantly delayed in excess of the 60 day NHS framework.
As previously reported the concern in relation to the delays in such investigations and any subsequent necessary action required, is twofold. Firstly, the quality of the investigation is severely compromised as the evidence is not captured when memories are fresh. Secondly, because any lessons to be learnt and improvements to be made to improve patient safety cannot be implemented promptly.","On the 19th of April 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Linda Louise Banks, aged 48 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18th of December 2023. The medical cause of death was 1a) Paracetamol overdose with alcohol misuse. I gave a narrative conclusion as follows:-
 
Linda Louise Banks died on the 10th of April 2022 at the University Hospital of North Durham. Linda had a history of alcohol misuse and mental health difficulties, including self harm and suicidal ideation. Linda also had learning difficulties which may have increased her vulnerability, which were not identified by vast majority of the mental health professionals, and there is no evidence that consideration was given to any reasonable adjustments that might be necessary, or as to any impact such may have had on her presentation, communication and understanding.
 
Linda herself, her family and her friends, made multiple contacts with mental health services between February 2022 and her death, as her mental health deteriorated and concerns were expressed as to her safety. Referrals were also made by two external agencies, namely her GP and a home support agency, both expressing concerns about Linda’s presentation. On each occasion risks were considered to be minimal and no further treatment or care was provided by mental health services.
 
There were a multiplicity of difficulties revealed by a serious incident review which was extensively delayed and not received until the end of January 2023, some 9 months after Linda’s death. It concludes that Linda did not receive the right care at the right time and her needs were not fully met, and included concerns, in summary, in relation to the quality of assessments and triage, quality of safety planning, poor record keeping, and further considers that there was an underestimation of risk and a lack of a trauma informed approach. I also find that these difficulties culminated in advice being given to a friend attempting to support Linda and communicated to her family, from an unknown mental health worker, that they should consider “tough love” and to effectively step back from their intensive support of Linda, thus removing an essential safety net in the absence of any ongoing mental health treatment or support. The identified failings cumulatively contributed to the death more than minimally.
 
An earlier thematic review which had been completed in November 2021 identified many similar serious issues in the provision of mental health services, to those identified in this case, and it is clear that many of these issues were continuing at the time of Linda’s death in April of 2022 and had not been addressed effectively by the Trust.
 
On the 9th April 2022 Police forced entry to Linda’s home, as a result of concerns raised by her family and friends and was taken to hospital by ambulance. She was hyperthermic and had low blood sugar and had taken an overdose of medication. Despite attempts to treat her she died in hospital on the 10th April 2022 as a result of the acute complications of paracetamol overdose on a background of alcohol related liver disease",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 23.2.24 .

She remained at UCLH until her death on 23 June 2023.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
There was a ten day delay in Ms Chappell’s transfer from the Princess Royal Hospital to UCLH. I was told that this might have been because of a lack of beds, but it might also have been because of confusion about which UCLH site was the accepting surgeon’s preferred destination, a confusion that was understood at the time by the Princess Royal to be a rejection of the transfer.
 
From at least 16 June 2023, the consultant urology surgeon in charge of Ms Chappell’s care was very firmly of the view that he was not the best clinician to fulfil this role. He had long since correctly determined that she had not sustained a ruptured bladder, and thus considered that her care belonged with the gastroenterologists or the general surgeons.
 
Despite the agreement on 16 June of the gastroenterology clinical director that Ms Chappell’s care should be led by the gastroenterologists, they had not taken over her care by the time of her death, and there had not even been a conversation between the gastroenterology and general surgery consultants about the transfer of care.
 
There was a frequent misunderstanding among the medical staff that Ms Chappell’s issues were all chronic. Her acute situation was often not properly handed over or understood by her consultants.","On 4 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sarah Chappell, aged 43 years.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Despite the Trust having prepared a detailed report and addendum for my consideration after the inquest I am still concerned about the following :
Paul Perrott’s observations charts were not filled out adequately or at all on the date of his death
There appeared to be a lack of clarity over who was responsible for checking the observation charts ,when they would be checked by staff over the course of a working day and who would regularly feed back to staff if there was a problem in this respect .
At least one member of staff was unaware that Paul had described himself to staff in May 2020 as looking for an opportunity to take his own life if it arose and that Paul had attempted to take his own life less than 3 months previously in exactly the same way as on 31st July 2020.
(4 ) Although certain changes to policy and procedures were described to me there still seems to be a focus on risk in the “here and now “which does not
include an analysis of historical and contextual risks","On 7th August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Paul Perrott , age 34 The investigation concluded at the end of a jury inquest on 17th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide but the jury answered a number of questions which raised concern over the level of observations and care given to Paul during his time on Ashcombe Ward.","Although there have already been changes made to polices and procedures in the hospital arising out of this death action should be taken:
– To review the procedures in place on the wards to ensure that observation charts are regularly checked by ward management and concerns feedback to staff quickly and appropriately
– To ensure that staff members are required and able to easily familiarise themselves with the full history in relation to each patient they care for as opposed to simply being made aware of any risks that present on the day which may not take account of historical or contextual risk .
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5th February 2024 .

He had spent most of his adult life in psychiatric hospital and had a recent history of self harm in that he had attempted to hang himself [REDACTED] on 20th May 2020 before finally succeeding in carrying out the exact same act on 31st July 2020 which this time resulted in his death. Mr Perrott was on 15 minute observations at the time of his death but these were not recorded and no one noticed he was missing until 15 minutes after his death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Despite the Trust having prepared a detailed report and addendum for my consideration after the inquest I am still concerned about the following :
Paul Perrott’s observations charts were not filled out adequately or at all on the date of his death
There appeared to be a lack of clarity over who was responsible for checking the observation charts ,when they would be checked by staff over the course of a working day and who would regularly feed back to staff if there was a problem in this respect .
At least one member of staff was unaware that Paul had described himself to staff in May 2020 as looking for an opportunity to take his own life if it arose and that Paul had attempted to take his own life less than 3 months previously in exactly the same way as on 31st July 2020.
(4 ) Although certain changes to policy and procedures were described to me there still seems to be a focus on risk in the “here and now “which does not
include an analysis of historical and contextual risks","On 7th August 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Paul Perrott , age 34 The investigation concluded at the end of a jury inquest on 17th November 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was suicide but the jury answered a number of questions which raised concern over the level of observations and care given to Paul during his time on Ashcombe Ward.","Although there have already been changes made to polices and procedures in the hospital arising out of this death action should be taken:
– To review the procedures in place on the wards to ensure that observation charts are regularly checked by ward management and concerns feedback to staff quickly and appropriately
– To ensure that staff members are required and able to easily familiarise themselves with the full history in relation to each patient they care for as opposed to simply being made aware of any risks that present on the day which may not take account of historical or contextual risk .
In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5th February 2024 .

On 3rd November he was found by the GP to have a distended abdomen and was referred on the two-week cancer pathway. CT scans found a mass in his bowel. Biopsies were initially inconclusive for cancer. A PET scan on 8th February confirmed advanced colorectal cancer. A stoma was inserted laparoscopically on 14th February to assist with his bowel symptoms. He was not seen for chemotherapy consideration until 6th March 2023. His health had deteriorated significantly since his referral on the cancer pathway and his suitability for chemotherapy was borderline. The plan was to start it around 17th March. In the period he developed spinal cord compression and received radiotherapy which was given on 21st March. He continued to deteriorate with the cancer having spread into his brain. Chemotherapy was not started until 4th April 2023.He deteriorated rapidly with the cancer having spread aggressively. He died at Stamford Court on 28th April 2023.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
The inquest heard evidence that a national shortage of specialist scanning facilities such as was required in Mr Williams’ case meant that there were delays nationally with the diagnosis of cancers. This in turn led to delays in treatment and poorer outcomes for cancer patients as delays in diagnosis meant that the cancer would often have advanced further, and treatment was less likely to be successful. This was compounded by the fact that additional complications such as cord compression could arise whilst a scan was awaited and that the patient would be less able to cope with treatment such as chemotherapy when it ultimately started.
 
The inquest also heard evidence that there were significant delays nationally in compliance with the two-week cancer pathway which led to poorer outcomes for patients as any delay in treatment reduced the likelihood of a successful outcome.
 
Evidence was also heard that the delay Mr Williams faced between diagnosis and being seen for a plan to be developed was also part of a wider national picture of delay in accessing cancer treatments and again reduced the chances of a successful treatment outcome.",On 3rd May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony Eric Williams. The investigation concluded on the 27th September 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of bowel cancer not diagnosed and not treated until it had reached an advanced stage. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 26th January 2024.

On 31 August 2018 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool Hospital presenting with vomiting and right upper quadrant pain, a known complication after a TACE procedure. Various medications were prescribed but the pain was ongoing. On 11 September 2018, whilst still in hospital, Amirah was prescribed dexamethasone (a steroid), initially [REDACTED] twice daily and  then [REDACTED] once a day. She was then discharged from hospital. A discharge summary was sent to her General Practice (GP) requesting the steroid medication to be reviewed. When the steroids were prescribed there was no indication noted as to the length of the intended treatment course in the clinical notes or in the discharge letter issued by the hospital team. In April 2019 the steroids were noted as a repeat prescription in the GP records rather than an acute prescription. It is unclear upon what basis this was done. On 12 June 2019 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital with dizzy spells. It was noted that her high blood pressure was poorly controlled. Her dexamethasone was continued in hospital and on discharge. A discharge summary was sent to her GP practice with the steroids to be continued. On 12 September 2019 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool hospital with similar symptoms. Her dexamethasone was continued again in hospital and on discharge. Throughout 2019-2022 Amirah had numerous consultations with various specialists in the Royal Liverpool University Hospital. On 29 December 2022 Amirah was admitted to the Royal Liverpool University Hospital feeling generally unwell and with leg pain. Treating medical professionals deemed that Amirah’s case was complex and multiple organ systems were investigated and treated. Despite active treatment Amirah deteriorated and died on 31 January 2023. The post mortem examination found it was more likely than not Amirah died as a result of multiple organ failure caused by sepsis and intestinal haemorrhage as a result of long term steroid therapy. Throughout, on each discharge from hospital, a discharge letter was sent to Amirah’s GP and was generally to continue the dexamethasone. There were a number of failures relating to the care and treatment afforded to Amirah; through numerous appointments an incomplete medication history was taken and documented which did not include dexamethasone. Amirah had multiple complex conditions and was under the care of numerous specialists, many of whom clearly did not appreciate she was on steroids, and had been, for a lengthy period of time. Amirah was seen by numerous clinicians both in the hospital and in the community and at no stage was it questioned as to why she was still on the steroids, and why at the high dose she was on. Evidence has been heard that it was rare for a patient to be on these steroids at this dose for a lengthy period of time. Amirah presented with symptoms clearly suggestive of the possibility of complications of steroid use, namely uncontrollable blood pressure, diabetes, swelling and cognitive impairment. There was a failure to recognise these obvious presentations and the link between them and the long term steroid use. There was a failure to document in the clinical notes and / or in the discharge letter, the indication or length of the dexamethasone tablets. This failure prevented adequate instructions being provided to Amirah’s GP as to the intended length of the dexamethasone treatment and monitoring of the same. There was a failure for the GP to clarify the discharge with the hospital and to review the medication, this failure was exacerbated by the fact the prescription was changed to repeat from acute with no apparent reason. Overall, there was a catalogue of missed opportunities both in hospital as well as in the community to identify that Amirah remained unnecessarily on dexamethasone tablets despite multiple reviews as an inpatient and outpatient. Even when the ongoing prescription was identified, and Amirah was symptomatic of Cushing’s disease and steroid induced diabetes the correct action to wean treatment completely was not undertaken. It is a basic and fundamental expectation for a clinician in charge of a patient’s care to monitor and review prescribed medication, particularly acute medication such as steroids. There was a failure to do this for Amirah despite the fact that there were numerous opportunities to do so over a lengthy period of time. The accumulation of failures through the primary and secondary care services has led to a gross failure to provide basic medical attention to Amirah who was in a dependent position and had every reason to rely upon those who had management of her care and treatment to prescribe, monitor and review her medication. It is more likely than not the inappropriate and prolonged administration of steroids caused Amirah’s death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Kenneth’s wife, [REDACTED] , made a 999 call at 16:55 hrs on 10th July 2022. The call was triaged as category 2 priority. The national target set by the Department of Health is to attend Category 2 incidents within 40 minutes on at least 90% of occasions, with an average response of 18 minutes.
 
The ambulance arrived the following day, 11 July 2022 at 01:05:59hrs, giving a response time of 8 hours, 10 minutes from the original 999 call.
 
Treliske hospital (Royal Cornwall Hospital Trust in Truro), were pre-warned about Kenneth’s condition and the surgical team were in theatre ready to perform an operation to insert a stent. However, Kenneth suffered a cardiac arrest on arrival at Treliske. The surgical team were summoned to assist with resuscitation. Medical teams attempted resuscitation for 47 minutes, but this was unsuccessful.
 
On the basis of evidence from the cardiologist, the court found that early treatment within 2 hours of a heart attack leads to significantly improved chances of survival.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Initial referral – there seems to be a gap at the initial referral and admission stage in obtaining information about and recording previous methods of self-harm and suicide. There also appears to be a gap in the seeking and recording of relevant information from an individual’s family at the point of referral and admission. An individual’s family is often able to provide detailed and useful information about events that may not have been previously reported and/or be able to bridge the gap in communications between various health agencies involved in someone’s care.
 
Access to notes – the other concerning issue is the difficulty prevalent within the private sector in the accessing of NHS notes. It appears to be the position across the private sector that access to an individual’s notes is not provided as standard. This means that there may be a significant gap in the information available when someone is admitted to a premises run by a private healthcare provider, even within an NHS allocated bed. This gap in information can have an impact on an individual’s risk assessment and their subsequent care plan.",On 19 May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Richard ALLUM aged 36.

Eventually police were able to climb over it and made their way down to the lower level. They asked for a life saving ring which was not easily accessible nor visible.

The occupier of the private dwelling gave evidence that he and his wife were advised by the East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust, during the course of the 999 call, to fetch a nearby community public access defibrillator from the Co-op store, 29 Doncaster Road, Carlton-in-Lindrick, Worksop, Nottinghamshire, S81 9JX.
 
The device was provided to the occupier by co-op staff. When the occupier arrived at Mackenzie’s side and opened the defibrillator pack, the audible instructions advised that the pads should be connected to the leads. On exploring the entirety of the device pack, it became apparent there were no pads, meaning the device could not be used. This delayed the use of a defibrillator, and the administration of a shock, if Mackenzie was in a shockable rhythm.
 
When the occupier later returned the device to the Co-op store, staff informed them that they knew the device was missing the pads because they had not been replaced since the device was last used.
 
I received evidence from East Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Trust that responsibility for maintaining the defibrillator device and associated equipment, including replacement pads, rests with the “guardian” of the device, not with the with the ambulance service. The ambulance service simply has access to a list of the locations of community pubic access defibrillators and advise callers of their nearest device in a cardiac arrest scenario.
 
I understand there were other community access defibrillators very close by which the occupier could have accessed if the ambulance service had known the device in the co-op store was “offline”.
 
I understand there is no single database listing the location and status of community public access defibrillators, rather a number of charity organisations provide such a service (NDDb and the British Heart Foundation) and I am unclear how the ambulance service are to know when a listed device is non-functional.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern) Central England Co-operative
1.     The community public access defibrillator in your store was supplied to a member of the public in a non-workable condition. There appears to be either no system for replacing the pads between uses, or an unsafe system in operation.
2.     There appears to be either a training or communication issue in that staff appear to have known the device was missing vital equipment, but the device was supplied anyway.

3.     In December 2022, the Government committed to making available over £1 million for the purchase of more community public access defibrillators, in recognition of the fact that these devices have the potential to save lives. I am concerned that without a clear system for ensuring (a) the maintenance and good order of all community public access defibrillators, and (b) a system for sharing with all ambulance Trusts the current status of defibrillators i.e. when they are out of service due to missing parts/maintenance, members of the public might be directed to a device that cannot

However, it does not appear that these two pieces of information were elicited by those assessing Mr Bailey in the emergency department of Northwick Park Hospital. I heard evidence that, if they had been, he should have been referred to the rapid access chest pain clinic.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Whilst the jury did not make any finding of acute behavioural disturbance (ABD) in this case, much evidence was heard about the training in identification of the signs and symptoms. National training of police officers on the identification of ABD is focused on a triad of warning flags being, hot to touch, exhibiting constant or near constant activity and extreme agitation or aggression. Some evidence identified that Carl Fullalove did not exhibit these triad symptoms but did exhibit other nuanced symptoms in the long list delivered in training. It was evident that his symptoms were not recognised as ABD due to drug intoxication, and that the consequential risks associated with prone restraint were not therefore considered. Prone restraint ultimately led to his death. There were six experts providing evidence to the inquest two of whom identified that Carl would not have died had he been recognised as unwell at the point of arrest and assessed by a health care practitioner. Such attention would have provided a calming intervention for his heart rate and breathing prior to being placed in prone restraint, which exerted additional pressure on his ability to breath freely.
 
A research paper before the inquest, namely ‘Consensus on Acute Behavioural Disturbance in the UK, September 2023 recommends that the focus remain on the triad of warning signs. ABD is clearly difficult to distinguish from drug intoxication by a non-medical practitioner. The rigidity of the training with focus on specific symptoms can cause police officers to miss other signs. The Superintendent, and head of ‘Protecting Vulnerable People’ for Cheshire accepted that with hindsight the use of prone restraint was inadvisable in this case.
 
Significant training on ABD had been delivered by Cheshire Constabulary through the College of Policing Personal Safety Training package module, the key to which was to identify an underlying medical condition to refer to a health care practitioner. That may be a lot to expect of police officers in a dynamic fast paced setting. The use of the term ABD may be a distraction.
 
The effect of stimulant drugs and the need for calming de-escalation in an upright position, rather than prone restraint, had not been noted in either the training material or the research paper presented to the Court. This is on the background of recognising from College of Policing guidance that a high percentage of deaths in prone restraint are in drug related cases.
 
The First Aid Learning Programme (FALP) will be in place within Forces by April 2024 and includes amongst other things positional asphyxia, unconscious and not breathing, and ABD but does not mention training in calming intervention that on balance of probabilities may have led to a different outcome in this case.",On 04 January 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Carl FULLALOVE aged 29.

He was fit and ready for discharge and was awaiting a placement in a suitable care facility. Whilst in the acute hospital setting, he deteriorated rapidly. His nutritional requirements were not fully met and his swallow deteriorated, which led to further weight loss and ultimately to him developing aspiration pneumonia.

The inquest heard evidence that if a suitable emergency social care placement had been available then Mr Hall would not have been admitted to hospital. However, there was no alternative as one could not be found and he was unsafe in the community. His stay in the acute setting led to a rapid deterioration. He had to continue to stay in hospital because a suitable social care placement could not be found for him. The evidence was that had he been in a suitable social care setting his needs would have been met in a more appropriate way.
 
The evidence was that these difficulties in finding a placement were as a result of issues in availability of social care within Stockport.",On 16th March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Hall. The investigation concluded on the 2nd August 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from the complications of poor swallow which developed whilst an inpatient where admission had been due to a shortage of a suitable community placement and discharge was delayed due to a shortage of a suitable social care placement. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 7th December 2023.

Department of Health and Social Care
Part of the challenge for the school was the decision about whether to obtain quick support for Alex through their counselling provision or whether to place Alex on a long waiting list for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services. They were not able to offer both as he would be removed from NHS services if he was receiving other service.
The provision of services for children and young people experiencing mental health difficulties carries long waiting lists and mitigation cannot be implemented where they will be removed from the waiting list for having that in place.
 
Department of Education
 
The provision of support services in school is not clear and consistent. The school in Alex’s case had to put in place their own provision as the Local procurement was delayed. In any event there is a lack of clarity around what should be in place in school in terms of counselling for those who may be transgender or questioning their identity or whether this is solely a role for Children and Adolescent Mental Health services.

to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. During the Inquest evidence was heard that: –
 
i. There are 5 separate units at Atherleigh Park Hospital and the current self-discharge against medical advice procedures or policies are uniform across all 5 units and do not involve a referral to a Consultant or Senior Doctor before the patient leaves the Hospital to check whether the patient should be considered for detention under the Mental health Act 1983.
 
ii. There is no check list in relation to self-discharge against medical advice patients for junior Doctors to refer to before the patient leaves the Hospital.
 
iii. No medication was prescribed or dispensed to the Deceased at the time of self-discharge.
 
2. I request that the Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust reviews the procedures and policies to cover all 5 units at the Atherleigh Park Hospital in relation to self-discharge against medical advice patients, with a review to there being a written policy, including a check list to assist junior Doctors.
 
3. I further request that the Trust reviews the procedures and policies in relation a referral to a Consultant or Senior Doctor before a self­ discharge against medical advice patient leaves the Hospital to check whether the patient should be considered for detention under the Mental health Act 1983.
 
4. I further request that the Trust reviews the procedures and policies in relation to the prescription and dispensing of medication before a

This was effective in controlling his mental health difficulties. Patients taking clozapine require close monitoring of their physical health due to the risks associated with the medication and attend a 4-weekly clinic. Blood samples are taken at these clinics to monitor white blood cell counts.   ,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
1 The abnormal triglyceride levels in Mr Daniel’s blood, whilst reported by the lab, were not escalated by telephone as this was not required by the hospital procedure at the time.
 
I am pleased to note that Hampshire Hospitals Trust have updated their procedures to include telephone escalation of raised triglyceride levels.
 
However the RCA report indicated that the findings in this case should be shared with the Royal College of Pathologists with a request that raised triglyceride levels be added to the RCPath guidelines for telephone action. In information received after the inquest the Hampshire Hospitals Trust advised that they could not tell me whether or not this action has been undertaken.
 
2.  The RCA report identifed that the format of discharge summaries provided to GPs by the ED department needed to be reviewed to ensure that actions to be undertaken by GPs were clearly identified. The results of this were to be audited.
 
Following the inquest I was provided with an audit report. This report dated 13/9/21 revealed that the computer system could not be altered as had been hoped and therefore a change of practice was introduced instead. This required clinicians to document actions in a free text section with appropriate flagging for GPs.  20 cases were audited and only half met the standardised national guidance and 8 lacked a clear diagnosis & details of what was expected from GPs.
 
Hamsphire Hospital Trust have informed me that further actions are being taken to address these deficiencies. However as it is now a year since the RCA report was prepared and over 2 years since Mr Daniel’s death I am concerned that this action is not being taken swiftly given the risks to patients.
 
3.  In relation to the blood tests required under the clozapine guidelines I was informed that Southern Health take the monthly blood tests and run these in the clozapine clinic. However the blood tests required of the annual physical health checks are not taken by the Southern Health staff but rather patients are required to attend phlebotomy services elsewhere for the blood to be taken.
 
I heard evidence during the inquest that Mr Daniels had missed some of these blood test appointments which meant his full tests were not carried out when expected. Clozapine is prescribed only to patients suffering from an enduring mental health condition for whom other medication has not been effective which indicates that they may be at risk of having difficulty managing appointments.","On 08 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sebastian Harry DANIELS aged 26.

Background
·       I heard evidence that when Ms GARLAND was on the Cardiac High Dependency Unit ‘HDU’ (part of the Intensive Care Unit) she was receiving intravenous antibiotics
·       When she then transferred from HDU to the Cardiac Ward there was a transcription error, and these antibiotics were accidentally omitted from the list of medications that she should be given on the new ward
·       As a result Ms GARLAND’s antibiotics were discontinued accidentally
·       I heard (and accepted) evidence that it would have been reasonable to discontinue antibiotics in any event at the time of Ms GARLAND’s transfer
·       Notwithstanding that fact, I remain deeply concerned by the circumstances in which the error took place
My concerns
 
·       I heard evidence from an ICU Consultant (who I found to be both a reliable and an impressive witness), who told me, among other things, that:
–        “… Transcription errors have always been a problem…” the ideal way to get rid of them would be to have a system [in the rest of the hospital] that speaks to ours
–        The ICU retains lists of its patients’ medication on a computerised/electronic system
–        The rest of the wards in the hospital do not operate the same system
–        The available systems do not speak to each other (to put it in somewhat colloquial terms)
–        Efforts to address that problem have proved fruitless
–        As a result, every time an inpatient moves from ICU to another department in the hospital, an appropriately qualified member of staff has to physically transcribe that patient’s medication list
–        With (for instance) 10 patients moving per day, 15-20 medications per patient, and multiple elements for each medication (name; dose; timing; indication; start date; signature etc.), “at a conservative estimate 1,500 to 2,000 elements [are transcribed] daily”
(Coroner’s comment: for obvious reasons this creates enormous potential for human error)
–        There are a limited number of people who can prescribe (and are therefore
able to perform this task); in critical care they are the same people who are responsible for providing care
–        “We really need a second check… funding for more pharmacists… as a Trust we’ve fallen short of ICU national standards for years in terms of the number of pharmacists per bed and medicines reconciliation”
–        “I spoke to the Chief Pharmaceutical Officer – he has submitted 5 proposals in the last 7 years to try to get the deficit funded… [without success]”
 
In summary, my view is that the circumstances currently in place create a very real (and known) risk that transcription errors will continue to occur. This in turn endangers patients, and creates a risk that people will die in the future as a result of such errors.
 
It is, sadly, very easy to envisage circumstances in which a patient might not receive essential medication at all, might receive the wrong dose of the medication they need, or might receive the wrong medication altogether, because of a transcription error.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken, and in the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.","On 31 October 2022 an investigation commenced into the death of Ms Cherry Lynne GARLAND, aged 77.

On 6 November 2022, Audrey was admitted to RCHT with abdominal pain secondary to femoral hernia obstruction. The apixaban was suspended pending surgery. Audrey underwent surgery for femoral hernia repair, that same day, 6 November 2022. The operation was uneventful.
 
On 9 November 2022 the eldercare consultant reviewed Audrey. The review notes were handwritten on paper medical notes. The eldercare consultant recommended that the surgical team restart Apixaban as soon as safe post operatively.
 
The court heard evidence that the NICE guidance on this subject states
 
Stroke risk associated with atrial fibrillation; Post procedure with immediate and complete haemostasis NOACs can generally be resumed 6–8 h after the end of the intervention. Some surgical interventions carry increased bleeding risk in which case resume anticoagulation 48–72 h post procedure but at the earliest opportunity
 
The apixaban was not restarted.
 
On 11 November 2022 Audrey had a severe stroke secondary to AF. Audrey died as a result of this complication four days later.
 
The court found that whether and when to re-start the apixaban was a decision for the surgical team. The court heard that on the consultant surgeon’s ward round his junior doctor colleague was briefing him, this included reference to the eldercare review paper notes. The junior doctor went through a number of aspects regarding care and treatment but did not refer to the recommendation to re-start apixaban. As a result, the consultant surgeon did not consider whether or not to re-start the apixaban.
 
The court heard that the eldercare team use paper medical notes whilst the surgical team use a digital system, known as NerveCentre. The consultant surgeon stated that the digital system is easier for the surgical team to read because the consultant surgeons can look at the detail on their phone or iPad. The consultant surgeon considered that the different recording platforms contributed to the error of omission in Audrey’s case.
 
Where an ‘important clinical note’ has been handwritten in the handwritten record there is facility for highlighting this on the ‘ward round’ function on Nerve centre. There was no alert that clinical notes had been handwritten in the written notes following the review by the eldercare consultant on 9th November.
 
The court found that apixaban was prescribed on admission and correctly suspended due to bleeding risk in light of pending surgery. There is no evidence of review of this suspension in either medicines reconciliation (10th November) or in the medical records. The court heard that there is no automatic flag on the Electronic Prescribing Medication Administration (EPMA) requiring review of the ongoing suspension of prescribed medication.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

The cause of death was hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, caused by a cardiac arrest, which itself was caused by a cardiac.   ","During the course of the inquest it transpired that there had previously been a scheme undertaken by Wetherspoons allowing staff to undertake additional training including CPR training. The evidence that was heard from a Consultant Intensivist was that the sooner that CPR can be commenced the greater chance that a person is able to survive a cardiac arrest, with minimal if no long lasting disabilities. The inquest concluded that the EMD should have directed staff at the Lord Cradoc to commence CPR and it is understood that compulsory training has been given to all Wetherspoons staff to enable them to comply with EMD instructions. This compulsory training dod not extend to CPR training.
 
It is not the purpose of this report to compel your organisation to provide CPR training to its staff but to make such training available to staff who express an interest. It is recognised that such situations are stressful situations and that it would be unfair to impose compulsory CPR training to staff, however as with all organisations some individuals would welcome the opportunity to benefit from such training. No failings were found against the staff who attended to Christopher that evening and they ought to be commended for their actions.
 
I am concerned that in such cases bar staff at pubs will invariably find themselves in situations where the administering of emergency CPR treatment ought to be administered. The time taken between the beginning of an emergency call and an instruction to commence CPR may deprive a patient of a favourable outcome. Whilst Wetherspoons staff have been trained to comply with EMD instructions there are occasions such as this case where staff could implement CPR of their own accord before being instructed to do so by EMD’s. The training would not only teach staff the correct techniques but educate them of the situations in which CPR should be used.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. –
 
1.       In a pub environment there is a greater chance for the public to sustain injuries that requires emergency treatment
2.       Ordinary bystanders’ ability to administer emergency treatment may be hindered by their own consumption of alcohol
3.       Whilst the primary responsibility of staff is to comply with EMD directions they are deprived of the opportunity to provide lifesaving treatment in circumstances that warrant it if that training is not offered
4.       Staff would not know the circumstances that warrant it without the benefit of CPR training.",On the 11th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher James Locke.

(3)  Staff seemed unfamiliar with the risk assessment/care plan, which I consider more of a systemic problem. It is unclear if/when care plans were reviewed by staff.
 
(4)  The care plan/risk assessment was not updated in light of a fall in November/December 2022. I was concerned that potentially significant developments might not be being taken into account in keeping the care plan under review.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.  
1.  Upon RA’s arrival back at the Nursing Home on 2nd August, staff immediately raised a Safeguarding concern in respect of, inter alia, his genitals being covered in a white “cheese” like substance with, additionally, faecal matter in his pubic hair; extensive areas of flaking skin including behind his ears was also identified. Colour photographs were taken and provided to the Trust along with the Safeguarding documentation. Objectively, the photographs clearly documented the flaking skin and white “cheese” like material covering RA’s penis.
 
2.  Evidence confirmed that the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, responsible for Basildon Hospital, carried out a significantly flawed RCA investigation which effectively rejected any suggestions of shortcoming in care, management and treatment. The Ward Matron (responsible for the ward concerned) was the co-author responsible for the RCA Report. [REDACTED] gave evidence to the inquest that she had not been provided with the photographs provided by the Nursing Home and RA’s daughter until just two weeks prior to the inquest hearing.  (It was noted and accepted that even when [REDACTED] had seen the photographs neither nor the Trust had seen fit to draw this to HMC’s attention or to provide either an addendum statement or a revised RCA).
 
3. The Trust’s responsible Adult Safeguarding Lead provided a statement in which [REDACTED] confirmed that, notwithstanding the photos having been expressly noted in the original Safeguarding referral and raised in subsequent correspondence and meetings with the Thurrock Local Authority Safeguarding Team, [REDACTED] had not made the photos available for the purposes of the RCA. [REDACTED] was unable to provide any explanation at all for this failure. This lack of professionalism was and remains a grave cause for concern resulting as it did in a seriously flawed Trust investigation, which itself fed into the Thurrock Adult Safeguarding investigation and, further still, a wider section 42 systemic investigation involving RA’s case and two others to which a range of stakeholders contributed. It was accepted by the Trust witnesses that but for the coronial investigation, the denials of any Trust failings would have remained unchallenged perpetuating a false record of the basic nursing care provided (or not provided) to the highly vulnerable and dependent RA.
 
4. The evidence heard at the inquest undermined the following erroneous findings of the RCA:
·  In response to the concern that RA had extensive flakes of fungal growth behind his ears the RCA concluded that “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation supports regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”
 
·  In respect to the concern that RA’s foreskin/genitals were covered in flakes and what appeared to be “cheese / paste” the RCA asserted that there were “no flakes noted in hospital, documentation support regular personal care was provided throughout admission.”","On 3rd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ronald Scott Ashdown, aged 55 years.

His mother was attended by paramedics, but really what she needed was early hospital obstetric care.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
That Phoenix’ death was and remains utterly devastating for his parents is unsurprising. However, it was clear at inquest that it was also deeply shocking for those trying to care for him and his mum. Events were outside the experience of several of the healthcare professionals involved.
 
I heard at inquest that new national maternity guidance is to be published at the end of the month. This will include within it revised advice for paramedics faced with an unplanned home delivery such as this one to transport to hospital even if birth is imminent. I was assured at inquest that the advice will quickly be disseminated.
 
Had I not been given this information, I would have made a prevention of future deaths report to the ambulance service.
 
It is of course of the utmost importance that hospital clinicians and ambulance clinicians have the same understanding of how a patient in any given situation should be treated, and I have copied this report to the London Ambulance Service (LAS).
 
The reason I make a report to the Homerton, is because it seemed to me at inquest that there were two matters that had not yet been resolved.
 
i)  At inquest, there was not a shared understanding among the clinicians within the trust about how such a situation should be approached.
 
The obstetricians were clear that, given her very high risk status, Phoenix’ mum needed to come in to hospital as soon as she showed the first signs of labour. And even if she had started to deliver, she could still only be treated effectively and Phoenix given the best chance of a good outcome in hospital.","On 3 August 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Phoenix Chapman, a baby who died less than six weeks after he was born. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 July 2023. I made a determination at inquest of death by natural causes.   ","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 11 September 2023.

He had been diagnosed with treatment resistant schizophrenia and depression and had been under the care of Mental health team since 1997. He was established on clozapine in 2004 which requires monthly monitoring due to its potential toxic effects. His clozapine level was 904 ug/L on 03/05/22. ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.       Monitoring clozapine levels: The inquest heard evidence that there was a clear system to monitor monthly blood test results looking for low white cell count, however there was no clear system for monitoring the actual clozapine and nor clozapine levels. In addition the inquest heard how there was no safe system to communicate high levels of clozapine.
 
2.       Medication changes: After a review on 14/10/22, when a high level of clozapine was noted from a blood test on 03/05/22, the consultant indicated that medication should reduce on the next prescription. This was communicated by email to the care coordinator however this was not read or acted upon. The inquest heard how there was no safe system to effect medication changes.
 
3.       How to record high clozapine levels: The clozapine and nor clozapine levels are recorded in the pharmacy section of the records. There was no system for highlighting high clozapine results in the rio notes which are routinely used by all clinicians.
 
4.       Understanding of clozapine: I heard evidence that there was a lack of understanding of when to measure clozapine levels, how to interpret high clozapine levels and then how to respond to a high level.
 
5.       August 2020 Regulation 28 report: I sent a Regulation 28 report in August 2020 (case of Ian Allen) which identified that there was no system in place to ensure abnormal clozapine levels were escalated and acted upon and that there was a lack of understanding of the importance of clozapine monitoring and how frequently levels should be monitored. Given this report there is a concern that the Trust has not learnt from the previous Regulation 28 report.
 
6.       Quality of the internal investigation process: The initial investigation report did not raise significant issues regarding the monitoring of clozapine and importantly whether Mr Hussain did in fact have toxicity. It was only when [REDACTED] wrote a report on 26/03/23 (7months after the death) that this issue was highlighted and addressed. This raises a concern about the quality of the internal investigation process and whether it is able to identify central issues in a particular case.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Preamble 
During the course of the inquest, evidence was heard about Mr. Ashton’s gambling activities, both prior to and, in greater detail, after July 2019. The evidence showed that Mr. Ashton had, at times, used a number of ways to protect himself from the potential of excessive losses from, and excessive deposits into, his online account, in order to gamble. Those methods included self-exclusion, temporary or permanent, from certain products and/or activities and placing limits on the value of his deposits and/or losses, during a specific, pre-determined period of time.
 
During the ‘relevant period’ examined closely during the investigation and inquest, between July 2019 and the date of Mr. Ashton’s death on 22 April 2021, although Mr. Ashton utilised a number of what are known as ‘player protection tools’, as outlined above, the operator he was gambling with during the relevant period, Betfair, did not take any measures, save for sending a number of e-mails to Mr. Ashton, to tell him about the existence of a number of protection tools that players could potentially access. During the relevant period, the evidence showed that Mr. Ashton was a problem gambler and, in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, his problem gambling became more acute, intrusive and, on balance, distressing to him.
 
Concerns
1)    I remain concerned that the player protection tools, as mentioned above, were and are inadequate to protect a person such as Mr. Ashton, who was a problem gambler with a worsening problem, specifically that such tools do not amount to any or any meaningful interaction with the gambler, or any intervention into the practices of the gambler.
 
2)     I remain concerned that the algorithm devised and operated by Betfair, to assist its staff in, amongst other things, observing and monitoring the gambling patterns and practices of its customers, failed to flag up Mr. Ashton as a problem gambler, despite the increases in his time online (gambling) the value of his deposits and the size of his losses, in part because his gambling practices, even in the last 10-12 weeks of his life, were deemed not to be exceptional, when averaged among gambling customers, generally.
 
3)     I remain concerned that, as was apparent through the evidence of a senior employee witness during the course of the inquest, the operator Betfair appears to judge the extent of its responsibilities to gambling customers solely with regard to industry (regulatory) standards, rather than current good or best practice in order to prevent further harming problem gamblers, or those who, as a result of their changing practices and patterns are likely to become problem gamblers.",On 06 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Luke Anthony Ashton aged 40. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29 June 2023. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Tuesday 5th September 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows –
 
·       There is limited evidence to date of improved communication, and a stronger working relationship, between the stroke team and the neurosurgical team at the Trust
 
·       There is limited evidence to date of the Stroke team having a clear understanding of the NICE guidance regarding Decompression Craniectomy, specifically the importance of detailed careful monitoring post stroke, with clarity about referral criteria to Neurosurgery. The planned Standard Operating Procedure, which may set out this clarity is not yet finalised.
 
·       There are currently limited opportunities for joint case discussion and learning between the Stroke and Neurosurgical teams. The Interventional Neuroradiologists could of course also usefully participate in such Educational opportunities – I note it was [REDACTED], (Consultant in Interventional Neuroradiology) rather than the Stroke team, who asked that Gordon was reviewed by the Neurosurgical team on the early evening of the 7th June 2022

She was operated on for a fracture to the neck of femur. Post-operatively she developed pneumonia. Subsequently the wound became infected, and a wound wash and debridement took place. She became increasingly frail. She was discharged home with support from the discharge to assess team. She felt unwell on 13th December 2022 and called for an ambulance with chest pains. Her initial call was dealt with as a category 5 call, and she contacted her GP. Her GP visited her and was concerned about her presentation. A further call to the ambulance service resulted in her being classified as a category 2 call. The blood tests taken indicated she was in severe heart failure and at a risk of a myocardial infarction. The ambulance arrived significantly outside the target Department of Health response times. The ambulance crew identified she needed urgent cardiac treatment and she was for transfer to hospital. Enroute to hospital she deteriorated further and died in the ambulance from complications of heart failure.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
 
The inquest heard evidence that under the Department of Health’s Ambulance Response time criteria, a category 2 call should have an average response time of 18 minutes and be within 40 minutes in 9 out of 10 cases.
 
The evidence before the inquest was that in her case the response time on the category 2 call was 1 hour and 5 minutes – significantly outside the target time. A response within the target time would have meant that she would not have deteriorated and died in the ambulance. She would have been in a hospital with access to treatment available in such a setting.
 
The evidence before the inquest was that her case was not a one off and delays of this nature had been occurring throughout the day. The mean time for Category 2 response times that day was 1 hour and 22 minutes and the 90th percentile was just over 3 hours.
 
At 17.58 that day there were 142 emergencies waiting in Greater Manchester alone and 430 across the North West. The average response time at that point for Category 2 patients was 2 hours and 33 minutes.
The inquest heard that the cause of these significant delays in patients receiving care in a timely manner was multifactorial and included the demand for ambulances across Greater Manchester and the North West and the long ambulance delays at A and E departments due to the demand on A and E services.",On 19th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joan Mary Corcoran.

She complained of a 5-day history of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Raquel had a low oxygen saturation, a high respiratory rate and a tachycardia. The assessing doctor used the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC), to rule out the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism causing her symptoms. The PERC test was positive, and a D Dimer should have been carried out. This was not done. A diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was made, based upon a low haemoglobin and low MCV level. Raquel was admitted to hospital and suffered from periods of desaturation requiring medical review and assessment. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was not re-visited and further investigations, such as arterial blood gases were not carried out. In the very early hours of 25 June 2021, Raquel became critically unwell. She required escalation of her
care, but this was not provided until she was in a peri-arrest state at around 0330 on 25 June 2021. Raquel suffered a cardiac arrest at around 0400 and received resuscitation and thrombolysis. Sadly, there was no response to the emergency efforts and Raquel passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on 25 June 2021. Had Raquel received the D Dimer test on the 23 June 2021, in accordance with the Trust’s policy, this is likely to have triggered further investigations which would have resulted in a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and a treatment dose of lower molecular weight heparin. On the balance of probabilities this would have prevented Raquel’s death on the 25 June 2021.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
1. There was a lack of thorough history taking and a number of assumptions were made on the basis of Raquel’s high BMI. There was an assumed chronic low oxygen saturation with no evidence that the doctors had checked the records available or asked the patient about her baseline. The oxygen saturations recorded in the Barts sleep apnoea clinic in 2015 and 2016 were noted to be 99% and 100%.
 
2. There was a lack of escalation of monitoring following the NEWS score of 10. It is of concern that the NEWS policy was not complied with by the nursing staff.
 
There was disagreement between senior clinicians as to how the Trust’s PE policy should have been applied. The policy is often not used in accordance with the specific wording. For example, the requirement for pleuritic chest pain is often ignored in practice. A senior clinician within the Trust considered that the caveat for pleuritic chest pain in the policy should be reviewed. In addition, the senior clinician described some of the wording in the policy as “clumsy”. In light of this, the Trust may wish to review the policy.","On the 26th July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raquel Mellonie Harper, aged 33 years.

Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.      a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion’s GP had made a ‘very
urgent’ referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this ‘very urgent’ referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.
 
b. During the evidence it was accepted that ‘a’ above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board’s investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.
 
An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion’s death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner.","On 21 June 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Eifion Wyn Huws (DOB 25/4/59) who died on 10 June 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 7 June 2023. 
The conclusion of the inquest was suicide.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 3 August 2023.

The main challenge during Jess’ pregnancy was her hypertension. The inquest found, however, that Jess’ hypertension was managed appropriately by her consultant in Chesterfield with input from a specialist renal physician.   ",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

• diabetes (type 2) diagnosed 1999
• chronic kidney disease, from 2012
• diverticular disease from 2012
• raised BMI, at times over 30,
• myasthenia gravis (MG), symptoms identified from around April 2020,
 
John was prescribed steroids from December 2020 for MG, escalating to the highest recommended dose of 100mg prednisolone, taken every other day. John received this high dose from 21 February 2021 until his death on 26 June 2021. That is with the exception of a period between 7 and 13 June 2021 following an inadvertent reduction in dosage to 25mg whilst an in-patient at RCHT. John was discharged on 15 June 2021 after this dosage error. I found that John was medically fit at the time of discharge and that the dosage error did not contribute to his cause of death.
 
John was re-admitted on 22 June with a history of vomiting and retching for 2 days before admission; I found on the evidence that this was the likely period when John suffered his perforated sigmoid colon. This was deemed inoperable. John did not respond to antibiotics and was discharged home on 25 June 2021 for palliative care. John died peacefully at home on 26 June 2021.
 
I found on the evidence of the histopathologist [REDACTED], that steroid therapy was contributory to John’s cause of death, alongside John’s other conditions. I found on the evidence that it was not possible to distinguish between the multiple conditions contributing to, and causative of, the perforated bowel.
 
[REDACTED] stated in evidence as follows:
 
…steroid therapy increases the risks of gastrointestinal complications including ulceration and perforation of the stomach, duodenum and the colon and these are recognised complications documented in the literature. The mechanism is unclear but steroids are thought to impair the mucosal barrier which enables bacteria to penetrate. Steroid induced colonic perforation is more likely to occur in patients with diverticular disease and the deceased was noted at autopsy to suffer from diverticular disease. It is speculated that in diverticular disease there is a localised concentration of bacteria.
Also, if the patient is treated by high dose steroids, the signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic complications may be masked by the anti-inflammatory effects of the drugs. This may potentially lead to delays in identification of the drug induced complications, so potentially resulting in the patient presenting with advanced complications such as viscus perforation.",During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. – 
(1) During the 2½ years in which Charlotte’s mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2½ years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte.
 
I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust’s own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust’s care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.
 
I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.
 
(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte’s referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trust’s Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so.
 
I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future.","[the details below are fictional]

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
During the course of the Inquest evidence was heard from the lead road traffic collision investigator in the case that there are significant concerns in relation to the adequacy and layout of this particular junction and the five other junctions on this stretch of road (A690). Evidence was given that since this fatality, there has been another fatal road traffic collision on the 22/12/22, at the junction directly opposite. Further that between 11/01/00 and 31/12/22 there have been 21 collisions at this junction (including this fatality and 3 other serious collisions) and that there have been 29 collisions at the other junctions on this stretch of road (including one further fatality and 6 other serious collisions).
 
The concerns in relation to this junction, and the other junctions relate to:-
1.  The volume of traffic that the junctions must manage.
2.  The complexity of traffic movement at the junctions.
3.  The speed limit in the vicinity of the junctions.
 
Concerns were also raised in relation to the planned extensive expansion/development of the area in the vicinity of the junction, including increased housing development, a proposed retail park, football site, as well as developments occurring more widely in the area which will lead to increased traffic, and that any proposed improvements to the junction are not required until prior to the occupation of the 39th dwelling on the site. The concern is that the proposals to improve the safety of the junction are not sufficient nor timely, and that consideration does not appear to have been given to reducing the speed limit within the junction series. A further concern was raised that the proposed improvements to the junction considered this junction in isolation, and did not consider the series of junctions on this
stretch of road.",On 12/07/2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Kelly Nicola DUNNE.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. Evidence was heard at the inquest of the “informal approach” taken with regard to arrangements as to who would provide supervision of residents, including on a one to one basis and who would cook and prepare their meals, including those residents who were subject to a specific SALT dietary plan. Evidence was also heard of steps which have been put in place since Mr Seaby’s death to provide written staff rotas for such matters, prepared by Team Leaders and Deputy Managers. However, despite these steps being taken, evidence was also heard at the inquest from staff, who continue to provide care at Oaks and Woodcroft Care Home, referring to providing care on an “informal basis” and that this “works”.",On 06 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Gary SEABY aged 63.

The police search revealed that Mr Parsons was last seen just before midnight on 22 April 2022 by a witness in the in the big tent at the harbour. The witness stated that Mr Parsons did not seem to be drunk at the time that they were speaking.
 
On 4 May 2022 the fully clothed body of Mr Parsons was recovered from the sea, approximately 4 miles off the coast of the Isles of Scilly after being spotted by a fisherman.

The Inquest findings were as follows
·       Mr Parsons died after midnight, on 23 April 2023 after falling into the harbour waters and drowning.
·       Due to Mr Parsons body being located fully clothed, he fell into the water by accident and not through choice.

·       The alcohol consumed by Mr Parsons made it more likely that when entering the water this would increase the risk of drowning due to impairment of cognition and motor skills.
·       Police evidence revealed that the sea off Porthleven features a notorious current that means it is not safe to swim in the harbour.
·       The pier and harbour walls raised safety issues discussed below under matters of concern. The police evidence was that these safety issues amounted to a failing to ensure the safety of members of the public.

Hawkins Farm is a family-owned dairy farm. As part of the fabric of some of the buildings on the farm, pre-cast concrete panels were used extensively, predominately as external walls for barns or similar. Typically, the concrete panels, which weigh approximately 800kg, are placed between vertical reinforced steel joists (RSJs), secured to the RSJ by means of a metal bracket bolted to the concrete panel. On Hawkins Farm two concrete panels had been repurposed from another building to form a divide between a “collecting yard” (an area where cattle are held prior to be being encouraged into the milking parlour) and an adjacent barn where straw was stored, with one panel placed on top of the other, to form a wall that was approximately 6 feet in height. The concrete panels did not stretch between the two RSJs present. As a consequence, one side was secured using the above-described method, with the other side being secured using sections of steel “box” (hollow steel tubing) welded to the RSJ and “clipped” against the rear of the concrete panel using a metal bracket. On 30th January 2021, Mr Woods was in the collecting yard when the upper concrete panel that divided the collecting yard from the straw storage came away from its fixing, causing multiple injuries to Mr Woods, who was sadly confirmed deceased at the scene.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

They outlined that approximately 15 metres from where Mr Easdale crossed the road, there was a traffic island (or pedestrian refuge) with a bollard and streetlamp in place. The bollard on the island is made out of opaque white plastic and is designed to be illuminated from within. The time of the collision was around 5pm on a December afternoon meaning that this stretch of road was in deep darkness.
 
When the collision occurred on the 5th November 2021, neither the illuminated bollard nor the streetlamp were in working order and were therefore unlit. Both officers from the collision unit gave evidence that this situation presented a danger to road users and pedestrians.
 
A Traffic Management Officer has brought this situation to the attention of Hertfordshire County Council, Highways England (now National Highways) and National Power Networks (now UK Power Networks).
 
Despite this, I heard evidence at the inquest that both the bollard and the streetlamp have still not been repaired and remain unlit even in the hours of darkness.
 
I was not able to say on the balance of probabilities that the lack of lighting on the pedestrian island
contributed to Mr Easdale’s death as he was not using the crossing itself when he was struck. He crossed nearby, however, and it is possible that had there been illumination at that island the driver of the car would have seen him earlier and potentially avoided the collision.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
Evidence received during the investigation and inquest (and corroborated by the family) demonstrated that nursing staff were trying to manage and care for patients in the very best way that they could. However, they were hampered in their efforts for the following reasons:
 
1.       Despite requesting additional nursing staff, the Bargeod ward was short-staffed when Mrs White fell. There did not appear to be any documented plan or procedure in place for how patients would be safely managed when it was not possible (because of staff shortage) to carry out the level of care for individual patients that they had been assessed as requiring.
 
2.       The ward is L-shaped and the patients on the ward are managed in individual cubicles. Mrs White should have been in view of nursing staff as part of her Level 4 enhanced care (‘observation of cohorted patients’). However, it was not possible to provide the observations that Mrs White required because:
a.    Patients were inside cubicles and therefore out of sight of staff and,
b.    The ward itself was L-shaped.
 
3.       The Bargoed ward is a stroke ward and one where it is usual to see patients who have a high risk of falls and mobility difficulties. Prior to Covid-19 it was explained that staff would take patients who required the Enhanced Care to the dayroom so that they could be under the required observation. Since Covid-19, this had not been possible. To counteract the logistical difficulties faced by staff in observation of Enhanced Care patients on the ward it was explained that patients are now moved to their cubicle doorway for periods of the day so that they are in sight of nursing staff. This appeared to be ineffective because:
a.    The particular care needs/wishes of a patient may mean that is not suitable.
b.    That only accounts for part of the day.
 
4.       To further counteract the difficulties with observing patients on Enhanced Level 4 care it was explained that clip-on alarm sensors were used. There was evidence given that patients are able to simply unclip these sensors, rendering the system ineffective.
 
A Falls Review Panel had noted that Providing Level 4 Enhanced Care on this ward was extremely challenging and that quality care at Level 4 was unachievable in a single room environment. It was noted that the Corporate Nursing Team had reviewed the Enhanced Care Policy in light of the fact it did not fit single room environment, however at the time of the inquest it did not appear from evidence received that a further plan to manage Level",On an investigation was opened on 22 June 2021 into the death of Mary Doreen White.,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 01 April 2023.

She ran a successful business as a talented ceramicist. On 22nd July 2022 she had consumed what she believed to be alcohol. The following day she felt unwell. She went to a hospital in Bali where she deteriorated and died on the 24th July 2022 despite treatment. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. It was found that she had methanol in her system which had caused her death. Methanol is not meant for human consumption. She had inadvertently consumed methanol believing she had consumed alcohol. The methanol had been sold as being alcohol fit for human consumption when it was not and caused her death.,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The Inquest heard evidence that there is a growing problem of methanol being passed off as alcohol for human consumption particularly in places such as Bali. Methanol is used rather than ethanol in spirits aimed at the Western market and sold even through apparently reputable suppliers.
 
The evidence before the Inquest was that :
1.  Knowledge of the problem amongst the expatriate/tourist community was very low despite the increase in the problem and the catastrophic consequences of methanol consumption;
 
2.  There was little publicity by the UK Government of the risk in contrast to the approach taken by the Australian Government who had undertaken a campaign to increase awareness to protect their citizens travelling in areas of Asia such as Bali;
 
3.  The UK Government publicising information about the risk of methanol being used in local spirits, steps that could be taken by UK nationals travelling to reduce the risk and warning signs of methanol toxicity would help to reduce the chance of others dying in the way in which Kirsty McKie died",On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Margaret McKie. ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 1st April 2023.

At about 09:15rs on Monday 31st May 2021 officers have been made aware of a concern for the wellbeing of PS DUIGNAN and they have been asked to make a search of the airport policing unit offices located at Percival Way Luton.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Sean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.
The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.
Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter [REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.
Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was [REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed – incorrectly – single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Sean’s access had been restricted she would not, I am
certain, have allowed him entry.","On 10 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sean Gerard DUIGNAN aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:
 
Sean Gerard Duignan was a well respected, well liked and universally helpful base sergeant at the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit (South Base). On the 29th May 2021 he was arrested following reports of a vehicle being driven erratically and dangerously. A Bedfordshire Police sergeant visited him at his home to conduct what was initially to be a welfare check. Sean was intoxicated with alcohol and was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of drink or drug driving. He remained in custody until the following afternoon when he was released under investigations. Multiple and serial enquiries were made by members of the custody and health care staff at Milton Keynes Police Custody suite to determine his mental health and to keep him safe. Those checks were repeated on release. They were continued by the police federation representatives and his close friend [REDACTED]. All seemed well. The next day, a day off, Sean travelled to the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit where the South Base armoury is located. The armoury security was lax and had been for a prolonged period. The computer system used for electronic access was repeatedly failing but seemingly no coherent approach was taken to remedy this. The back up master armoury key was kept in a PIN protected locked box, but the PIN number was universally known. Because of an error in the computerised system an officer was allocated single point access when she should not have been. She unwittingly let Sean, whose own access to the armoury had been restricted without his colleagues being informed, into the armoury. He took a hand gun and ammunition, entered the base gym and shot himself in the head.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 13, 2023.
