Thomas Ithell was aged 77 at the time of his death on 20 November 2022. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2017 and biopsies revealed bilateral adenocarcinoma of the prostate. He underwent radiotherapy in 2018 and hormone deprivation treatment. From April 2021 onwards his PSA levels increased periodically. In October 2021 his level was 5.5ng/ml having been 1.5ng/m lin April 2021 and 2.7ng/m in July 2021 indicating a recurrence of the cancer and likely incurable. Thomas Ithell was reluctant to undergo further hormone treatment as he found tolerating the side effects difficult. He did not then have his PSA levels tested after November 2021 and was not reviewed at all due to becoming missed to follow up. After he had been seen by the nurse practitioner on 5 November 2021 the letter written by the nurse practitioner for advice from the consultant did not reach the consultant. He was reviewed by a consultant on 22 October 2022 after an urgent suspected cancer GP referral following routine set of blood tests in September 2022, some 10 months later. Mr Ithell died in hospital on 20 November 2022 having been admitted with shortness of breath, the malignancy having caused his death.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows
During the course of the evidence it was identified that:
 
There was no Datix raised by anyone when the error (Mr Ithell being lost to follow up) was identified, either at the time of the appointment on 22 October 2022 when the error was identified or at any point thereafter;
 
There has been no investigation by the Health Board into how Mr Ithell came lost for follow up after his appointment on 5 November 2021;
 
There have been no assurances as to what, if any, changes and learning have been identified other than a tracking system for PSA monitoring;
 
Evidence was heard at the Inquest that time restraints on hospital staff had meant that Datix was not completed and that the system was not user-friendly.
 
I have raised a number of Prevention of Future Death reports with the Health Board previously around investigation processes. I remain incredibly concerned that where matters are not raised in accordance with internal Health Board processes that assurances given to me previously in Prevention of Future Death Reports cannot be supported. Furthermore, I am concerned that Datix reports will not be raised if time constraints prevents such, where the Health Board themselves often identify the Datix reporting system as the initiation of governance / investigation processes.",On 6 December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Thomas Grenville Hammersley Ithell (DOB 24/4/45) who died on 20 November 2022.

She was found by her son in her garden hanging [REDACTED]. In December 2022 Rachel Mortimer took an overdose of [REDACTED]. A Mental health act assessment was undertaken but she was not deemed to require sectioning at this time. On 18 June 2023 Rachel was seen by the Mental Health Liaison Team (MHLT) at Barnsley Hospital after taking an overdose of prescribed [REDACTED] and trying to hang herself. She said she had been having suicidal thoughts for a long time, she did not regret her actions and that thoughts of her family did not stop her. She was assessed by the MHLT as having risk of future impulsive self harm and suicide when using alcohol and risk of further deterioration of her mental state without timely appropriate mental health support to develop coping skills. She was referred to IHBTT and was discharged from hospital. No MHA assessment was undertaken. She was seen by IHBTT and her risks of emotional dysregulation without engaging in therapy and risk of harmful alcohol use were identified. She was to be referred to BSARCS and told to refer herself to recovery services as mitigation. She was assessed as low risk of suicide even though she had initially stated she was not regretful of what done and disappointed that she had not died, she was assessed as not having current suicidal thoughts or intentions of suicide and wanted to engage in therapy. She was provided with contact numbers to call if she wanted to discuss her mental health at any time.
 
Unfortunately, whilst she was referred to BSARCS she was not accepted. Despite this being a risk factor no other mitigation was offered at this time and therefore the risk was not mitigated.
  
On 21 June at 4pm IBHTT Rachel’s mother contacted IHBTT with concerns, she was told that Rachel should contact the GP for access to services and that they could not provide any information due to data protection. At no point was Mrs Mortimer provided any information on what to do if she was concerned for Rachels safety such as taking her to ED or that Rachel could contact certain mental health services to discuss her feelings in a crisis. A further call was made at 5.30pm, an hour and a half later, by Rachel’s son, who expressed concerns that she was expressing suicidal ideas, again no signposting was given. A further call was made on the same day by paramedics with concerns and again they were told that she had been advised to contact her GP. No signposting was provided or consideration given to the fact previously identified risks which had not been mitigated and she was drinking which had been identified as having a risk of future impulsive self harm and suicide.
 
Despite these 3 contacts by family and paramedics, at no point was any safety netting in terms of the options available if they were concerned provided, such as to take her to ED or for her to call any mental health services given. A phone call was made that evening to Rachel but as Police were with her she was unable to discuss and asked for a call back later which was not answered.
 
IHBTT discussed Rachel on 22 June 2023 and decided she should be called for a review of her mental state and risks and to offer secondary mental health follow up. 7 telephone calls were made between 22 and 26 June with no success. IHBTT knowing that she had had 2 previous suicide attempts, had risk factors that had not been mitigated and had recently been contacted on by family with significant concerns that she was suicidal the IHBTT treatment team took no further action and on 26 June, with no contact, assessed her as low risk due to lack of contact.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Following concerned calls by family no advice was provided on what options were available to them if they were concerned for their family members safety and no provision of services that could be called to discuss her mental state.
Despite identifying the risk of emotional dysregulation and that BSARCS would mitigate this risk. When IHCBTT were informed BSARC was not available no further consideration was given to any other service to minimise the risk.",On 10 July 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rachel Louise MORTIMER.

Despite emergency medical attention he was unable to be resuscitated and died as a result of his injuries. No drugs or alcohol were involved in the death. The Deceased was a third-year student at university and was neurodiverse. He had been struggling with the pressures of his third year of study, following irregularities created and imposed on his otherwise established study routine and rhythm of daily living as a result of successive lockdowns. He had also fallen ill with Covid-19 in March 2022 and was believed to have been suffering long covid symptoms in the subsequent months. His illness had impacted on his concentration and his ability to perform, as well as causing chronic fatigue and insomnia. As a result, he had fallen behind in his third-year project and, it is believed, had determined that he was going to be unable to successfully pass his year of study, thereby preventing his ability to proceed at university and halting his ambition to pursue his academic career. It is believed that these factors had had an overwhelming effect on him, leading, on 30 June 2022 – the day of the publication of his exam results – to an acute anxiety crisis out of which he was unable to see a path. Although he had left no clear explanation of his feelings or reason for his actions, the evidence established that it was more likely than not that he had jumped from the bridge in a moment of acute distress in the early hours of the morning. There was no evidence to suggest that he had accidentally fallen to his death and no evidence of any third-party involvement. It was found that his actions were impulsive yet deliberate in their intent to take his own life, whilst suffering an acute anxiety crisis.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Matthew was neurodiverse. It was accepted that this condition was not known by the university at the relevant time, as he was diagnosed after his commencement on his course and did not disclose his condition to the university. In the circumstances, appropriate actions and case specific assistance which might otherwise have been available to and assisted Matthew were neither implemented in response nor accessed by him. Notwithstanding Matthew’s neurodiverity – which of itself was a barrier to him being able to reach out or to seek help – I am concerned about the level of awareness, understanding and curiosity of academic staff around the mental health of students, particularly in the post-pandemic climate, where interruptions to their study and dysregulated student life have had a significant impact on their mental health.
 
Whilst it was explained to me that all staff are offered training on mental health management and are provided with guidance on how to support students, I am concerned that aspects of this are not made compulsory for academic staff. Where a myriad of training options are made available to staff and often required of them, with very little practical time available in which to do it, there is a risk that modules and aids with regard to mental health will not be prioritised, followed through or addressed. There is as I understand it no evident monitoring in respect of which staff have viewed or undertaken what training or indeed in respect of who has completed the modules on offer. It remains unclear as to who or how many staff have actually viewed or undertaken the online training around student mental health.
 
Although the process of ‘raising a concern’ by academic staff is a means by which such matters can be considered and is a process set up and encouraged through the student hubs, I am concerned that in not ensuring that academic staff are at least armed with the ability to spot or to know when to make initial enquiries of students or are clearly guided on how best to do so (particularly with regard to an understanding of the needs and skills required to liaise with students with neurodiversity), there is a risk that an over-focus on academic policies and procedures will endure and that those students who are struggling to adhere to them will be missed or overlooked.",On 30 June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew George WICKES aged 21. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 4 August 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The Deceased’s parents informed the attending police officer that Mr Helstrip had been buying drugs from the “Dark Web” and that packages containing these drugs had been sent, recorded delivery, via Royal Mail to his premises. Despite this, the police investigation concluded that there were no suspicious circumstances or third-party involvement surrounding Mr Helstrip’s death and hence no criminal investigation took place. This was based on the attending officer’s impression, which did not appear to take into consideration the information about the sourcing and method of delivery of the drugs. Subsequently, Mr Helstrip’s parents contacted the then Chief Constable of Humberside Police, in 2023 informing him of their concerns about the lack of investigation on the part of the police. A senior investigating officer was then allocated to the case, who looked at the issue of illicit drugs being sent via Royal Mail, by recorded delivery, to see whether the vendor of these substances could be identified and help police with their inquiries. Evidence was heard from this detective, that whilst the investigation is still on-going, time sensitive evidence in the form of CCTV footage from the post office from whence the package was sent, is irretrievably lost, and that this has compromised the identification of the suspect.","On 30th September 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of William Steven Helstrip, aged 18 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Evidence was heard that the height of drop from the edge of the promenade to the sand at the location John fell, whilst on his mobility scooter, was approximately 5 feet.
 
The court was told that, at a number of locations, the height from the edge of the promenade to the sand was prone to change, and a system was in place to monitor this. It was however, acknowledged, that unusual high tide conditions, and/or weather activity could significantly change the drop height in a short period of time.
 
Evidence heard that at high-risk locations, such as areas with persistent long drops, drops onto concrete, or drops onto rock sea defences, permanent barriers were installed.
 
In other areas signage and/or painted markings were used to highlight the risks of a potential fall.
 
It was acknowledged that individuals on mobility scooters were known to regularly access and use the promenade. Due to the demographics of the local area it was acknowledged that the use of mobility scooters on the promenade may increase in the future.
 
Evidence was also heard from a mobility scooter supplier and engineer, who explained that falling asleep on a mobility scooter was not uncommon, and happened more frequently than the general public might think. The supplier explained that this often led to accidents, leading to damage to the mobility scooters, which required repair.
 
I am therefore concerned that falls from the promenade onto the beach, in areas where there is no barrier, would occur again in similar circumstances, as the current signage and markings provide no warning to an individual asleep on their mobility scooter.
 
If this were to occur (as in this case) in an area where the height of drop from the edge of the promenade to the sand was greater than normally expected, I am concerned this would lead to future loss of life.","On 20 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of:   John Thomas GRAY

[REDACTED] rang police at 4.33pm, exactly one hour before he actually jumped off the roof. Police attended immediately and sought firefighter assistance immediately. However, they reported to me at inquest that there was some delay in the attendance of LFB.
 
Upon attendance, firefighters recognised that their ladders would not reach the roof of the flats and so called for an extended height ladder appliance. This had to travel from further afield and [REDACTED] became more agitated during the wait. It had not arrived at 5.33pm when he jumped.

There was concern she had suffered a brain bleed so a CT scan was arranged which was misreported as normal as it was later found to show some subtle signs of cerebral swelling but no brain bleed. Had the CT scan been correctly reported it is likely a referral would have been made through NORSE to specialist neurosurgeons and the condition would have been identified and successfully treated.

She was advised to see her GP about the high blood pressure which was identified at the hospital. Given the strong clinical signs of a brain bleed and refusal of lumber puncture a referral should have been made through NORSE to the specialist neurosurgeons which would on balance have identified the condition and successful treatment would have been provided. She attended her GP on 28/06/23 and was prescribed blood pressure medication. On 07/07/23 she advised the GP her headache had resolved as her blood pressure became normal. She collapsed at home on 20/07/23 and was readmitted to hospital where a CT scan confirmed an unsurvivable brain bleed caused by a right middle cerebral aneurysm. She died at the hospital on 21/07/23.   ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
1. The inquest heard evidence from a specialist neurosurgeons at University Hospital Birmingham that there are guidelines to confirm a patient with strong clinical signs of a brain bleed, should be referred through NORSE particularly when they have refused a lumber puncture which is the usual test undertaken in accordance with the NICE guidelines. Clinicians at Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospital City hospital site said they were unaware of those guidelines and didn’t consider a referral for Mrs Kuklinska. Consideration needs to be given to establishing clear guidance with acute trusts to ensure patients with strong clinical signs of a brain bleed are referred for specialist neurosurgical advice.",On 10 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dorota Marta KUKLINSKA. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The following matters of concern are directed to Sodexo for response –
 
It is important to note that at the time of Kane’s death, the prison was managed by Serco Ltd under a contract awarded by HMPPS. Since Kane’s death, the contract for managing the prison has been awarded to Sodexo. Sodexo were invited to submit learning evidence to the court, if such existed, but instead said they would respond to any prevention of future death report I felt was necessary.
 
A number of the prison staff involved in Kane’s care in October 2021 continue to work at the prison and were unaware of local policy in relation to the matters below as of present times.
 
Having received no formal evidence of any changes made at HMP Lowdham Grange, and staff having failed to report any evidence of changes, I highlight the following concerns –
 
1. Ignoring Cell Bells
I heard evidence that staff were engaging in the deliberate ignoring of prisoner cell bells. I have seen no local policy which either prohibits such activity, or, if such activity is permitted, supports staff to make risk-based considerations about how and when to ignore cell bells.
 
I observe that deliberately ignoring cell bells appears to be a wholly dangerous practice as the cell bell is the only method of communication between prisoner and staff during periods of lock up, including night state. The practice appears to be all the more dangerous when one considers some staff suspected Kane to be in a state of heightened emotion and acting under the influence of alcohol.
 
Isolating power to cells
As above, I have seen no policy which supports the isolation of power to cells including who has the power to make such a decision, how long the power should be isolated for, and whether staff are required to consider any risk factors when determining whether to isolate power to the cell.
 
Failure to follow the local Under the Influence Policy
Three members of staff suspected Kane was under the influence of something in the hours before his death, yet none opened an under the influence log or sought any medical advice about how frequently to check on him, what signs of deterioration to look out for, and when to seek further assistance.
 
Lack of understanding of Prison Service Instruction 64/2011, and possible discord between local policy and the PSI
A number of prison officers believed Kane’s birthday was incapable of amounting to a “key date or anniversary” for the purposes of PSI 64/2011. It seems to me to be common sense that a birthday, being the anniversary of one’s birth, could amount to a potential trigger date for heightened emotions which considering a prisoner’s risk of self harm and suicide. That is not to say it would be so for each and every prisoner, but perhaps something to be cognisant of when dealing with an emotional and intoxicated prisoner. I have seen no evidence that this is covered in Sodexo’s training for staff on the ACCT process, if indeed any series of training exists.
 
A number of prison officers gave evidence that an ACCT was not necessary because Kane had not said to anyone that he was going to harm himself (either fatally or otherwise). Serco’s Safer Prison Operating Policy (August 2022) is confusing on this point and seems to suggest at paragraph 3.4 that staff should only open an ACCT when a statement of self-harm has been verbalised. This is not consistent with the PSI. Sodexo have not offered for scrutiny any local policy, guidance or training material on the threshold for opening an ACCT, but even if such exists, it appears some staff continue to labour under the misapprehension that a prisoner must say they are thinking of harming themselves before an ACCT can be opened.
 
A failure to implement learning from the investigations that follow deaths in custody
Many of the staff giving evidence explained that they had not read the PPO report, nor were they aware of the issues identified by the PPO prior to giving evidence at the inquest. I have seen no evidence of the systems in place at HMP Lowdham Grange to seek to learn from deaths in custody at the earliest opportunity.
 
The following matters of concern are addressed to The Minister for Prisons and Probation, HMPPS –
 
Poor Quality Early Learning Review process, November 2021
While it is recognised that the ELR process is designed to capture information at a very early stage of the investigation, it is nevertheless an important tool in seeking to identify safety issues that should be addressed swiftly in order to prevent future deaths.
 
The central issue in this case was obvious from the outset, as recorded in various intelligence reports submitted by staff on the night of the death, namely, a number of members of staff suspected Kane to be under the influence of alcohol yet failed to take the necessary steps to seek to safeguard against harm.
 
On page 4 of the ELR it is concluded that “all procedures were followed” and there were no local or national recommendations for learning lessons. It is difficult to rationalise this conclusion against the evidence available even at the earliest stages of the investigation. The author was clearly aware that staff had considered Kane to be under the influence of alcohol (see page 1) and should have been aware that no Under the Influence Log existed. The author simply notes that “the policy has been reviewed”. There is no explanation as to why the policy wasn’t followed. Was the policy unclear in its requirements? Was there an absence of staff training on the policy? Of great concern to me is the fact that staff giving evidence at the inquest still seemed to fail to grasp the significance of intoxication as a risk factor for self-harm.
 
My concerns extend beyond the quality of the report, but also to the accuracy of the same.
 
The report is written in such a way as to create the impression that the author interviewed key members of staff. Comments are attributed to staff at particular points in time, yet all prison staff witnesses denied ever having been interviewed as part of the ELR process. It is unclear exactly what methodology the author has used during the investigation. I am concerned that the quality of the investigation has led to missed opportunities to have identified these issues at the outset.
 
7. A Lack of Candour – both organisationally and individually
I would be very interested to understand how the duty of candour applies to the prison service and those individuals within the employ of the service (whether employed directly or through a private provider, as in this case).
 
There is a statutory duty of candour applicable to healthcare organisations and professionals, as well as a more recent agreement by the College of Policing for members to adhere to a Code of Candour.
 
In practise, candour creates a culture of being open and honest with all stakeholders by accepting when things go wrong, taking remedial steps as soon as practicable, and thus reducing the risk of events repeating themselves. In the context of a death, candour from the outset is essential in order to support the bereaved family.
 
The position adopted by Serco in this inquest, as it has in other inquests, could be said to represent the very opposite of candour. Having heard evidence supplied on Oath by their own staff members that there were multiple failures to open an under the influence log (evidence which was not contested) the organisation nevertheless required the Jury to return a finding on this issue, and each and every issue, instead of a factual finding being presented to the jury as agreed by all Interested Persons.
 
The inquest is not an adversarial process, there is no burden of proof. The Interested Persons are under a duty to assist the investigative process in an open and honest manner by identifying those issues that genuinely require determination by the jury, and those on which there is agreement. Sadly, in my extensive experience of conducting Article 2 inquests locally, this is not an isolated example of the uncomfortable position adopted by the prison service in failing to put forward sensible and reasonable factual admissions of shortcomings.
 
I am concerned by the apparent absence of a culture of candour supporting those staff who work within the prison service. Many of the staff members giving evidence explained that the inquest was the first time it had been suggested to them that they had not adhered to policy. In the intervening period of over two years between Kane’s death and the inquest, no-one at the prison had asked key staff to reflect on the care they provided to Kane that night and consider areas of learning. Again, this is not a position unique to this inquest, and is of great concern in the context of a rising number of self-inflicted prisoner deaths at HMP Lowdham Grange since Kane’s tragic death in 2021.
 
I would be grateful if your response could address what steps have been, or are being taken, to ensure that candour is applied throughout the death in custody process.","Kane Christopher Boyce died by ligature asphyxiation on 3 October 2021, at HMP Lowdham Grange, Nottinghamshire, where he was detained as a serving prisoner.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Consideration should be given to the review of the treatment, monitoring and management of patients with a history of epilepsy or seizures by both the prison staff and healthcare staff. In particular, there was no seizure care plan, no seizure diary and once the ACCT had closed on 10th March 2021, there was no formal mechanism of monitoring Trevor’s condition. Further, the ACCT is not a suitable mechanism for such monitoring. The CSRA policy is designed to protect other prisoners, but not those who suffer from medical conditions as Trevor suffered. PPG in their evidence to be considered relating to PFD matters state that a care plan dashboard is now in place at HMP Lewes but this does not appear to be individualized or tailored to the prisoner’s clinical requirements.
 
Communication between healthcare and prison staff especially when Trevor was returned to the wing, between the prison staff and family, briefing by prison managers to officers on the wing about Trevor’s condition were all inadequate.
 
Evidence was heard about the lack of integration of various IT systems which contributed to poor communication. In spite of the evidence from PPG regarding the sensitivity of medical records which should not be disclosed to the prison staff, I remain concerned that there was no effective monitoring and management of Trevor on the wing once the ACCT was closed. There was no mechanism in place for prison and healthcare staff to report their concerns about Trevor’s non compliance with taking his medication to Security, thus preventing the cell from being searched for retained medication.
 
There was a lack of training of prison staff in dealing with long term health conditions such as epilepsy on the wings. I understand there is a deficit in national policy within the prison service to manage and support prisoners with epilepsy and seizures.",On 22 April 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Trevor Alan MONERVILLE aged 33.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 September 2023.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 07, 2024.

Mr Harper was stood sufficiently close to the trailer, that at the end of dispensing when the stored energy was released, it caused the unsecured tail end of the coiled pipe to spring and strike Mr Harper causing serious abdominal and chest injuries, and he died the following day. The coil trailer was supplied with a restraining clamp and strap.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Availability of ambulances to carry out transfers in a timely manner, in urgent cases, between NHS Hospitals and in responding to 999 and 111 calls in the community.
Confusion as between ambulance and hospital staff and a lack of clarity in the purpose of and process for the categorisation of transfers (particularly in urgent situations) between NHS hospitals.

Adequacy of the action plan provided to the court in addressing the concern at (a) above and that of ambulance attendances to 999 and 111 calls; the plan is generalised, lacking detail and any means of measurement of progress.
 
Evidence received at Inquest identified waits for ambulance attendance of between 5-6 hours on the evening of 9th/10th December 2022.

In Mr. KING’s case he was exhibiting symptoms of having suffered/was suffering a heart attack.
 
In Mr. KING’s case he had arrived at hospital been triaged, assessed and arrangements for urgent lifesaving care made by competent emergency clinicians in conjunction with experts from the regional cardiac unit. This included the requirement for an urgent transfer to the regional cardiac centre. A request for an emergency transfer from West Suffolk Hospital to The Royal Papworth Hospital was subject to further computer algorithm-based triage by the ambulance service. This resulted in a several hour delay to Mr. KING’s transfer, notwithstanding the protests from competent clinical staff in the Accident and Emergency Department at West Suffolk Hospital.

A chest x-ray was performed on 29 November 2022 which showed right upper lobe pneumonia and some pleural effusion. Iona was escalated from high-flow nasal cannula oxygen to continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”).   Iona continued to receive antibiotics and her condition appeared to improve. On 30 November 2022 she was stepped down from high-dependency care.   ,"During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Following Iona’s death, the Northampton General Hospital NHS Trust conducted a Serious Incident Investigation. One of the recommendations made by the investigation panel was:
 
“Children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should be suspected of having a pleural effusion and should get an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”
 
That recommendation reflected advice provided on 29th November 2022 (the day after Iona’s admission to Northampton General Hospital) by the East Midlands Paediatric Critical Care Network:
 
“We would like to inform you of a high number of cases of highly aggressive sepsis, linked to empyema, and positive culture for Group A Streptococcus in the region. This has caused significant morbidity and mortality.
We advise early referral, aggressive management, high dose intravenous antibiotics, and early drainage of empyemas.
Please have a low threshold for investigating any child with a secondary respiratory deterioration, especially with new onset of fever. Chest X-Ray and ultrasound will be beneficial.”
 
At the inquest into Iona’s death, I heard evidence from the Trust’s Clinical Director of the Child Health Directorate who is also a Consultant Paediatrician.
 
On the basis of the evidence I heard from the Clinical Director, I am satisfied that the Trust has taken action in respect of the recommendations made and more broadly have reflected upon the circumstances of Iona’s death. However, in respect of the recommendation set out above, I am concerned that there remains a risk that future deaths could occur unless further action is taken.
 
The recommendation made by the investigation panel was that children with pneumonia who are not improving after forty-eight hours of treatment or deteriorate at a later point should get “an immediate x-ray and chest ultrasound”. However, the evidence I heard suggests this is not possible.
 
I heard from the Clinical Director that as a district general hospital, Northampton General Hospital does not have access to a paediatric radiologist outside of 9am-5pm on Mondays and Fridays when such a specialist is either on duty or on-call. I heard evidence that in Iona’s case, a Consultant in ITU and Anaesthesia was able to perform an ultrasound scan at around 2pm on 4th December 2022 however this is not a facility that would routinely be available to the Trust and was not, in any event, part of that clinician’s core duties.
 
I am concerned that a very unwell child who may require a chest ultrasound may not receive one ‘immediately’ and in fact may have to wait for a considerable period of time. For example, if the need arose over a weekend, that child may not receive an ultrasound scan for up to 48 hours.","On 14th December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Iona Grace Buckingham, aged 9 months.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
There was evidence that staff at Conway House were significantly concerned for Mr Cork’s welfare, which is why he was deemed as ‘at risk’. As a result of being ‘at risk’ I was told that welfare checks were required to be undertaken, at least every 24 hours. Such checks required a staff member to physically see and interact with Mr Cork or, in the alternative, to telephone him and speak to him. Welfare checks were then required to be recorded on a spreadsheet. Despite this, I was told in evidence that welfare checks would only be recorded if the resident in question was actually ‘seen’ by the staff member undertaking the check; this raises the concern that there is disparity about what constitutes a welfare check and what will or will not be recorded.
 
I heard evidence that prior to Mr Cork being found unresponsive in his room on 22 May 2023, the last recorded welfare check for Mr Cork was during the early shift of Saturday 20 May 2023. The concern here is that Mr Cork, despite being required to have welfare checks at least once every 24 hours, was not properly checked upon for between 36- 48 hours prior to his death.
 
A night project worker at Conway House told me in evidence that they had opened Mr Cork’s door at about 20:35 on Sunday 21 May 2023, but did not enter the room to see or assess Mr Cork. The only reason for opening the door appears to have been the arrival of the ‘EMS team’ who were required to check that Mr Cork was at home for the purposes of conditions imposed by the criminal justice system.
 
Having heard what they believed to be snoring, the staff member closed the door and left. This fact was verified by Metropolitan Police Officers who checked CCTV footage as part of their initial investigation following Mr Cork’s death. The concern here is that staff made assumptions that the ‘snoring’ noise was coming from Cork’s room and not an adjoining room, and that the noise was snoring, without investigating further. This was a missed opportunity to properly check on Mr Cork’s welfare, as required.
 
In evidence, I was taken through the spreadsheet that is used to record all checks and/or welfare checks required for any residents of Conway House. The record system appears to have been a basic Microsoft Excel spreadsheet devised by staff. I was told that the computer and/or spreadsheet often ‘crashed’, which led to data sometimes not being able to be recorded. I also observed that some fields of the spreadsheet were often left blank. Staff undertaking and recording checks regularly appeared not to input their name(s) or the time at which checks were undertaken. I was also told that while there was some training on how to undertake and record welfare checks, this was not needed because it was a simple task.
 
The concern here is that the recording system for welfare checks may not be adequate and that the approach taken to filling in the data required on the spreadsheet varied from one staff member to another, which may also indicate that there is a training need.
 
I was told in evidence that the same spreadsheet is still used to record any checks and/or welfare checks required for residents. I was told that the issues identified with a lack of checks for Mr Cork were caused by the fact that there were a significant number of agency staff on duty and that Conway House no longer uses agency staff. However, the staff member that opened Mr Cork’s door at 20:35 (without entering the room or seeing Mr Cork) on 21 May 2023 and subsequently found him unresponsive on the morning of 22 May 2023 was a substantive member of staff.
 
I was not reassured that any proper investigation into these issues had been undertaken or that any action(s) required to bring about improvements in the system of undertaking and recording welfare checks have been identified and/or implemented.","On 15 June 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of NICHOLAS CORK, then aged 57 years.

She had been admitted to hospital two months previously for laparoscopic surgery to remove a screening detected colonic cancer. She had a prolonged admission due to multiple postoperative complications requiring further surgeries. Throughout her admission she was given anticoagulant prophylaxis in the form of enoxaparin. Her clinical condition was improving and it seemed as if the cancer had been fully removed but at the time of discharge her mobility remained significantly restricted. Anticoagulant prophylaxis stopped when she left the hospital and it is unclear if ongoing indication was considered. It is more likely than not that the lack of ongoing prophylaxis led to the formation of thrombosis in her left leg and her death due to pulmonary embolism.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

(1) The surgical mortality review conducted after Karena’s does not seem to have considered the role that anticoagulation may have played.

Karena was past the 28 day period but still had significant restriction at the time of discharge. A few years ago I heard a very similar case which occurred at a different health trust. The purpose of this report is to suggest that discharge planning might have a prompt to consider possible ongoing anticoagulant prophylaxis in patients who leave the hospital but have not yet regained full mobility.","On 16 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Karena WICKINGS.

Tammy was assessed as being at high and ongoing risk of ingesting foreign objects, a risk which had materialised on many occasions prior to her death, and often lead to hospital admission. Her risk of self-harm by ingestion led to the lawful use of mechanical restraints, comprising of mittens, a bio belt, eyesight or arm’s length observations, controlled and supervised access to items when spending time out of her mittens, and a total restriction on Tammy having free access to personal items. On 22 March 2021, hospital staff provided Tammy was a twistable crayon to use while her mittens were removed. The twistable crayon had not been risk assessed or approved for use by Tammy’s MDT, who were responsible for setting her care plan. In those circumstances, the twistable crayon ought not to have been provided to her. If the crayon had been presented to the MDT, her Consultant Psychiatrist would not have approved its use as it would have posed an obvious risk of serious harm if ingested due to its size and plastic structure. Instead, alternative child-safe small wax crayons could have been used to meet the same therapeutic purpose. At this time, the Trust did not have any documented system that set out the requirements for the MDT to approve the use of risk items, but this was nevertheless an expectation on the MDT, which they failed to complete. There is no clear or consistent record of who was observing Tammy or what items she had been granted access to on 22 March 2021. Despite the crayon being noted as “missing” from the pack, no incident report was completed, nor was the Security Manager alerted or any ward level plan initiated to seek to locate the risk item. Tammy started to present with symptoms of a complication of swallowing the item the next day. She reported nausea after eating, vomiting and epigastric tenderness. Mental health staff escalated her symptoms to the physical healthcare team. Tammy reported to the Advanced Clinical Practitioner that she could feel the twistable crayon inside her. The ACP made a plan to monitor for any deterioration and to discuss with the GP the following day. She was not escalated for investigations at the local hospital despite the size of the missing item and Tammy reporting feeling it inside her.
The Trust failed to have in place a formal policy relating to the management of the ingestion of foreign bodies. This meant that staff were not all working to a clear plan of how to monitor for, detect and respond to the medical complications of ingesting foreign bodies. The MDT failed to have in place a care plan specific to Tammy’s risk of swallowing, setting out how this should be managed and escalated by ward staff. There was no continuing, co-ordinated investigation to seek to locate the twistable crayon. On the evening of 16th May 2021 Tammy was observed to be vomiting in her toilet and at the same time reaching into the toilet. When asked, Tammy reported that she had swallowed a toothbrush. An out of grounds visit was arranged to take Tammy to Bassetlaw District General hospital. Tammy was examined at Bassetlaw General Hospital and was given an x-ray at 01:33am on 17th May 2021 which did not reveal any foreign bodies. Tammy was booked for an ultrasound scan later that day but was discharged at approximately 9:30am and returned to Rampton Hospital before this could be completed.
Staff seem to have taken the negative x-ray result as evidence that there were no foreign bodies in Tammy’s system. Many staff were unaware of the limitations of x-ray in relation to non-radiopaque items or the extent of the imaging.
On the evening of 4th June 2021 Tammy reported discomfort and anxiety due to constipation. Given the timing and symptoms we feel this is likely to be the beginning of Tammy’s deterioration. No actions beyond further observations are recorded to have taken place, staff appear to have taken Tammy’s constipation entirely at face value. There is no evidence that the twistable crayon was being considered at this point.
Tammy spent most of the day of 5th June 2021 in bed due to worsening symptoms. It is recorded that a mechanical restraint review was undertaken by the duty doctor, but it is unclear whether any physical examination of Tammy was undertaken at this point.
By the evening of 5th June Tammy’s temperature and heart rate had begun to spike and mental health staff became concerned. The same duty doctor was contacted during the evening by ward staff as Tammy continued to deteriorate. The duty doctor did not attend the ward or examine Tammy and advised ward staff to provide Tammy with paracetamol. This represents a missed opportunity to have recognised the deteriorating patient and to have sought medical attention.
There is no record at this point that Tammy’s symptoms were linked in any way to foreign body ingestion, despite Tammy voicing concern that she may have perforated her bowel. Tammy’s symptoms continued to worsen throughout the early hours of 6th June 2021, including high pulse rate and temperature, anxiety, abdominal pain and vomiting, escalating to projectile vomiting and apparent ‘faecal’ vomit.
The Hospital Trust failed to adhere to the NEWS2 Policy when Tammy was acutely unwell. NEWS2 was not recorded as frequently as required, at times the readings were incomplete, and the total score was not acted upon in accordance with the policy. This led to an underestimation of Tammy’s clinical risk, and multiple missed opportunities to have rendered care in an acute hospital which would probably have prevented her death
The physical healthcare team and the on-call Duty Doctor failed to recognise Tammy was a deteriorating patient and failed to take steps to arrange her timely transfer to an acute hospital for treatment of her perforated bowel.
Over the weekend of 5-6 June 2021 there was a breakdown in communication between the ward staff, physical healthcare staff, duty doctor, and site management as to Tammy’s signs and symptoms which led to a delay in her being transported to hospital to receive treatment for her condition
Tammy continued to deteriorate throughout the morning of 6th June 2021, until shortly after 2pm when Tammy’s symptoms were recognised by the physical healthcare team to be so severe that an ambulance would be required to take Tammy to hospital. A number of miscommunications between staff, added to the lack of a clear escalation protocol for staff to follow, resulted in a delay to the ambulance being called, because staff were unclear who should call the medical emergency.","During the course of the inquest I heard evidence giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Poor Quality Acute Physical Healthcare in the mental health setting
Tammy’s death demonstrates a further example of a failure by medical staff to recognise a deteriorating patient and a subsequent delay in escalating for acute secondary care intervention.
Her death comes after repeated concerns have been raised about the quality of the Trust’s physical healthcare service in secure settings since 2018 (when Angus Bowie died from sepsis due to a perforation), in 2019 (when Christopher Howard Smith died from a pulmonary embolus), in 2020 (when Alexander Braund died from a chest infection) and in 2021 (when Michelle Louise Whitehead died from Hyponatraemic Encephalopathy).
At each of those inquests, the Trust committed to improving the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings and yet the same poor quality has prevailed in Tammy’s care.
These are examples of preventable deaths and the similarity in themes across them is exceptionally worrying.
Action needs to be taken at the most senior level to effect meaningful change to the quality of physical healthcare across all secure settings at which the Trust provides services, recognising this class of patients as exceptionally vulnerable to deterioration as they are unable, either through mental health challenges and/or incarceration, to access healthcare services of their own volition.
 
Failure to Adhere to the National and Local National Early Warning Score (version 2) Policy
This is a repeated theme identified at inquest and in previous Prevention of Future Death reports. Staff remained unclear at the inquest about how frequently vital signs ought to be taken, where and how to record the values, and what action should be taken depending on the score.
 
A lack of robust policy relating to Ingestion of Foreign Bodies
I heard evidence that the Trust is in the process of drafting a policy, but it became clear during evidence that the policy is not yet sufficiently robust.
The policy needs to cover the assessment of risk when access is permitted to risk items, where such a risk assessment is stored and who is responsible for its review of content, what to do when ingestion is
suspected including how this should be managed medically and what security measures need to be taken to locate the item.
 
4. Emergency Medical Calls
There was significant confusion in this case as to who should call a medical emergency and how information should be relayed to the ambulance service. It had been recognised early in the day by the Security Team that Tammy may require an out of grounds medical transfer, but it was not until much later in the afternoon, when Tammy was in cardiac arrest, that an ambulance was called. The Security Team expected the physical healthcare team to place the call, the physical healthcare team expected the ward to place the call due to proximity to the patient.
Evidence called at the inquest established continued confusion amongst staff as to how an emergency should be managed.
 
This appears to be a training issue.","On 13 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Tammy Mary Louise WATKINS, aged 36, which concluded by inquest held before me sitting with a Jury between 9 and 20 October 2023.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 March 2024.

She had ischaemic and hypertensive heart disease and developed a large sacral sore with associated sepsis. These conditions precipitated congestive cardiac failure. She was admitted to Tameside General Hospital on 19th May 2023 where despite treatment, she died the same day of Sepsis with congestive cardiac failure.
 
The inquest heard that Mrs Roberts was supported by care agency carers four times per day and the District Nursing Team. Following a Tissue Viability assessment on 20th April 2023 the frequency of visits by the District Nursing team was increased to daily until Mrs Roberts was admitted to Tameside General Hospital on 19th May 2023.
 
The Inquest heard that the care agency raised concerns with Adult Social Care because her dressings were not being changed daily. In addition, Mrs Robert’s family raised concerns as did the hospital nurse responsible for Mrs Robert’s care on 19th May 2023. As a result, an investigation was opened by the District Nursing Service.
 
The Inquest heard that insufficient dressing changes for a sacral sore can lead to localised and systemic infection due to the risk of a sore in that area of the body being contaminated with urine and faeces.
 
The family were told on several occasions that the nursing team did not have time to change dressings. On 17th May 2023 a nurse did not attend to care for Mrs Roberts due to demands upon the District Nursing Team. The team offered instead an out of hours visit that would have disturbed Mrs Roberts and her family from sleep and so this was not accepted.
 
The Inquest heard that there are ongoing staffing issues within the District Nursing Team.
 
Following the Serious Incident Investigation, a number of measures have been undertaken by the Tameside and Glossop Integrated Care NHS Foundation Trust to address issues identified with the care of Mrs Roberts and with the district nursing service generally including:
 
Introduction of weekly compliance checks for Waterlow, MUST and body mapping policies.
All District Nursing Visits deferred to the out of hours service must be approved by Sister of Team leader.
 
However, the Inquest heard that despite a number of steps taken locally to manage the District Nursing Service such as using a variety of different staffing grades for visits, staffing shortages cannot be rectified by local action without a change of approach nationally.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

Her electricity meter (installed in 2001) was in a cupboard, just inside the communal door to the flats, some 7-8 feet off the ground.
 
Mrs Faulkner, was only 4’10” tall, and had no choice but to access the meter using a stepladder every time she wished to add credit to her pre-payment meter.
 
On 2 December 2022, Mrs Faulkner purchased credit for her electricity meter and then climbed the stepladder to put the credit onto the meter. In trying to access the meter she fell from the ladder and landed on the floor, where she was discovered some hours later by neighbours.
 
Mrs Faulkner sadly died in hospital on 8 December 2022, as a direct result of the injuries she sustained in the fall.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The electricity meter was installed at such a height that anyone wishing to access it would be unable to do so without the use of steps/a ladder. In addition, the placement of the meter (immediately behind an inwardly opening front door with no windows) added to the risk of using a stepladder because anyone coming through the door would be entirely unable to see anyone using a stepladder behind the door. Irrespective of the type of meter, it is reasonably foreseeable that electricity meters need to be accessed by people from time to time and not only those with the requisite training for working at height.
 
Siting prepayment meters, in particular, at such a height and location adds to the risk, because those choosing to use a pre-payment meter are required to access it each and every time they top-up the meter.
 
The electricity company which installed the meter in 2001 has “no records of what consideration they gave at the point of installation to the specific meter location.” Other meters in the property are at a similar height and it is not uncommon to find electricity meters at heights requiring steps to access them; there appears to be no industry standard requiring electricity meters to be easily accessible (albeit secure) by all potential customers, except perhaps in new build properties.","On 13 December 2022, an investigation was commenced into the death of BERNADETTE GRACE FAULKNER, then aged 80 years.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
The evidence, in particular from the London Fire Brigade’s Fire Investigation Team, revealed that:
 
Mr Lee’s death was one of three in London in 2023 attributable to fire started by faulty lithium-ion batteries and/or chargers for e-bikes or e- scooters.
 
The number of fires in London attributed to electric powered personal vehicles (e-bikes or e-scooters) has risen significantly and consistently in the past four years (26 fires in 2020; 74 fires in 2021; 116 fires in 2022; and 169 fires up to mid-December 2023).

While in the care of the Emergency Department Mr HOLGATE sustained a fall. A CT scan showed evidence of a traumatic head injury, Mr HOLGATE was deemed very unwell and not for surgical intervention. Mr HOLGATE deteriorated further and another CT scan showed an ongoing bleed with mass shift which had not been evident on the original CT. Mr HOLGATE was reviewed again and still deemed not fit for intervention and placed on a palliative care pathway. Mr HOLGATE died on 1st November 2023.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
This matter was referred to this court and is a case where it is entirely suitable to proceed to inquest without the need for a post mortem examination.
Evidence regarding the cause of death will be provided at inquest by way of a statement from the treating clinician with the CT scans showing the sequence of events.
The family indicated that it had been Mr HOLGATE’s wishes, and indeed something that they supported, for his body to be donated for medical science/research.
This process has long been a way of researching illness and disease as well as assisting in the training of doctors. It is recognised as fundamentally important to progressing the understanding of medicine and treatment.
 
Each receiving medical research/training establishment have a criteria, one of which is that, unless there are exceptional circumstances, the deceased should not have undergone a post mortem examination. This is understandable, and exceptions allow in certain instances this to be waivered.
 
In Mr HOLGATE’s case the local medical research/training establishment had full capacity and were unable to accept him. As is normal the family/Coroners Officer were referred to an alternative establishment at Nottingham.
 
Nottingham politely declined, they indicated that they were prevented from accepting due to what appears to be an anomaly in the law. As the matter was subject of a coronial inquest they could not accept the donation.
 
In non-inquest matters reported to the coroner, where post mortem examination is not required and the coroner is content there is no requirement to investigate further, a form A is signed to indicate this and the coroner is then able to return the deceased back in to the care of their family/personal representative/funeral director to allow funeral arrangements or body donation to proceed. In these instances medical research/training establishments are able to accept donation.
 
Where a coroner is likely to hold an inquest in a situation where a post mortem is not necessary as a cause of death statement can be obtained and the coroner is content that there is no further need to retain the deceased for any further examination, the coroner must also ensure that the deceased is returned back to the care of the family/personal representative/funeral director as soon as practicable. This normally allows for funeral arrangements to proceed.
 
In both instances the coroner authorises release of the deceased, in majority of cases the person is cremated ie they will not be available nor required for the coroner, even when the matter is proceeding to inquest. All relevant enquiries have to be made and sufficient evidence obtained before the release is authorised.",,"In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.
 
This may be by way of clarification or guidance if S11 overrides the need to register before acceptance.
 
Donations of this kind further the advancement of medicine, treatments and training and as such prevent many deaths. It appears that those people who are subject of an inquest should not be prevented from donating their bodies when the coroner is content it is entirely appropriate to do so and it is the wishes of those making the arrangements.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 28th February 2024.

A member of staff was with him. On arrival he was triaged at 11:01 and assessed by a physician associate at 13:34. This was reviewed by the Emergency Medicine Consultant and a diagnosis of acute intestinal obstruction was made based on the clinical assessment and x- ray of the abdomen which showed distended bowel loops. He was deemed stable and was referred to the nurse co-ordinator on the Surgical Assessment Unit (SAU) at 14:30. Evidence was provided at the inquest that the NELA (National emergency laparotomy audit) risk of death score was 2.3% at this time of referral.
 
Crucially no CT scan was undertaken which would have provided better resolution and information on the presenting condition. Evidence was given at the inquest that this would form basic medical treatment for an acute intestinal obstruction and consideration of an abdominal emergency laparotomy. Later under examination from the trust representative, the witness recanted slightly on this stating that more junior doctors may not be minded to seek a CT scan, and commented surprisingly that requesting a scan by a consultant in the Emergency department could not be guaranteed.
 
I received evidence in the form of the serious incident report that there were nursing shortages on that day and that the department was under considerable pressure. No surgical referral had been made. Concerns were raised that observations were not completed on time and I heard evidence from family members that their concerns about Karmchand and the pain he was suffering were not taken on board by staff. The SI report noted that there were difficulties in assessing his condition due to his mental health difficulties meaning that he could not express pain to staff as easily. His family and staff who knew him raised concerns, but adequate notice does not appear to have been taken..
 
At 20:30 Karmchand Deteriorated with decreasing level of consciousness and oxygen saturations and was escalated to the ED registrar and transferred to the resuscitation area where he was intubated and taken for CT scan at 22:00. The CT scan demonstrated dilated large bowel and a decision was taken for him to have urgent surgery
 
The delay in seeking a CT scan, which did not occur until that evening meant that surgery to treat the bowel distention only occurred much later into the evening and into the early morning of 24 September 2022. By this time, the NELA risk assessment had increased from 2.3% to 52% in other words, death was more likely to occur at that point of surgery than earlier in the day.
 
Mr Gulzar died during surgery in the early hours of 24 September 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Karmchand was referred to the surgical nursing team instead of the surgical registrar or surgical on-call team, as required by the Emergency Department to surgical registrar referral pathway from a previous SI where it had been identified as an issue. This was not followed in this case, leading to a delay in surgery and increased risk of death. I am concerned that the surgical registrar referral pathway is not being utilised despite previous incidents in which its use was highlighted as necessary.
 
No CT scan was undertaken as required by the acute abdominal pathway and guidance as part of the initial assessment. I was concerned by evidence that a CT scan would not be undertaken urgently as part of an acute abdominal presentation and that the necessity for a scan may not be known by junior (or some consultant) doctors.
 
The deterioration in Karmchand’s condition was not recognised due to difficulties in communication of pain due to his mental health condition. Concerns raised by his carers and family who knew him best and his presentation were not given adequate weight. A previous SI was reported to have raised this issue, but no action point or plan was provided in the current report to set out how staff could improve the assessment of patients with communication difficulties, by using observations and relying on people
who better knew their demeanour and presentation.","On 26 September 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death
of Karmchand GULZAR. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 13 December 2023. The findings and conclusion of the inquest were
 
Mr Karmchand Gulzar died at Sandwell hospital on 24 September 2022 during the course of an emergency operation to treat dilated large bowel. There had been a delay in obtaining a CT scan which showed the extent of the condition, meaning that the prospects of surviving surgery had reduced significantly by the time of the operation. Other warning signs of the significance of the surgical abdomen obstruction were not noted including a lactate level of 5 showing that Mr Gulzar was deteriorating. An immediate surgical review was not undertaken. These matters contributed more than minimally to Mr Gulzar’s death.

[REDACTED] is available to anyone to purchase online, directly from the company. The company appears to have some link to the UK as there is a UK helpline number. The [REDACTED] appears to provide step by step instruction on how to end your life using certain methods, including how to make the death appear to be due to natural causes and therefore avoid referral to the coroner. Whilst the introduction suggests it is aimed at those who are elderly and long-term suffering, there is also reference to suicide for other reasons within the book and is likely to appear to vulnerable mental health patients.
 
According to the evidence of the police officer, you can also buy drugs to end your life through this website.
 
The only check on age and ID appears to be after a purchase, to allow you access to online forums where you can get further advice on best methods.
 
The [REDACTED] has been banned in Australia (and possibly other countries) as it is deemed to encourage/ assist in suicide.

She sustained multiple injuries incompatible with life. At the time she was under the care of Oxleas NHS Trust Adults’ Community Mental Health Team. She believed she had early onset dementia which was being investigated. She had poor sleep and low mood in the months prior to her death but there was no formal diagnosis for her mental condition at the time of her death.","British Transport Police made a referral to the Older Adult Community Mental Health Team, Oxleas NHS Trust, on 25th January 2023, following an incident at Hither Green Station, when Mrs Porter had attempted to end her life by standing in front of an incoming train, which stopped.
 
The 9 page referral included information that Mrs Porter: “…made a deliberate act to jump onto the tracks in front of a train” and “Q: In your opinion, due to proximity of lethal means if it hadn’t been for certain actions would death or serious harm have occurred? A:Yes”. The summary of the incident on page 4, was only partially complete, in that it did not include the information that the train had stopped. It stated she: “decided to jump down on to the tracks to take her own life but then changed her mind and came back onto the platform”.
 
The inquest heard the Trust did not interrogate the Safeguarding and Vulnerability Report, prepared by British Transport Police. The Trust Staff relied on the summary of the incident, both at the triage stage and subsequently during the psychiatric reviews. The Trust staff did not contact British Transport Police again to establish any information about the incident (for example the CCTV was not viewed nor a summary of the footage requested, nor were any meetings convened or discussions held between the Trust and British Transport Police).
 
The Trust conducted a review of the care and treatment provided to Mrs Porter. Their Report stated: “Had the referral from BTP to OACMHT included a full account of the circumstances of the incident on 25 January 2023, the OACMHT would have had a fuller understanding of the level of intent exhibited on that occasion, and subsequently risks would have been  determined as high, and a more robust plan of care implemented to mitigate against these risks, that would have been immediately shared with her family”. It was established at Inquest that had the full details of the incident on 25th January 2023 been understood – ie that Denise intended to take her life and this was only prevented by the slowing and halting of the train – that the psychiatrist would have referred her either to the Intensive Home Treatment Team (with consent) or for a Mental Health Act assessment (if no consent had been forthcoming).
 
The Trust’s Report stated: “There were no identified service delivery issues that impacted on the services’ ability to offer care and treatment”. However, in oral evidence, the Trust’s witness agreed this was inaccurate, following reflection upon the missed opportunities of investigating the events of 25th January 2023.
 
The Trust was unable to provide the Inquest with information to satisfy my concern that the Trust has robust systems in place to avoid the risk that staff may rely upon short summaries from British Transport Police, rather than scrutinising all the information contained within a referral and making relevant inquiries if the reporting is ambiguous or incomplete.
 
In this case, the Trust was clearly of the view that the detail was significant but was overly reliant upon partial information which resulted in missed opportunities for appropriate referral.",On 23 February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Denise Jane PORTER.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 I am concerned that the current clinical and public health guidelines do not identify Healthcare professionals as a group at heightened risk of TB exposure.
I am concerned that the current definition of ‘close contact’, thus triggering a contact trace or warn and inform letter, sets the bar too high for notifying NHS staff of the risk of exposure to TB.
I am concerned that there are insufficient education measures in place to inform NHS staff of the TB symptoms to looks out for, and the need to inform any assessing clinician of their possible exposure to the condition in order to facilitate early diagnostic testing.
Carrianne was exposed to a very aggressive form of TB from what seemed to be a rather transient exposure to the index patient during her occupation as a Nurse. Of course, not each and every contact with a patient will be logged within the medical records, especially in relation to an ambulatory patient such as the index patient in this case, and so it is possible that Carrianne had greater exposure to the patient while on the ward than interrogation of the medical records would suggest. But at its height, she had only been at work on the unit at the same time as the index patient over 23 and 24 November.
 
The index patient was cared for in a side room with infection prevention measures in place but Carrianne may well have been unaware that the infectious disease in question was TB as she was not the “named nurse” for this patient and lots of patients had increased infection prevention measures in place during the pandemic. Indeed, Carrianne had denied any known TB exposure when asked by doctors during her respiratory illness.
 
Carrianne’s case highlights the increased transmissibility of smear positive TB in the context of limited exposure to the index patient. I heard evidence from an expert who told me of cases of medical professionals contracting the condition despite no known direct contact with the patient but having spent time in a corridor containing an air vent leading from the infected patient’s room.
 
The warn and inform parameters did not alter (as in broaden) to reflect the fact that the index case was smear positive and highly transmissible, and the patient was known to be ambulatory on the ward. I cannot see a good reason for restricting the warn and inform letter process, rather than applying the same broadly to all staff who worked on the unit at the relevant time.
 
Carrianne’s case highlights the importance of warning all staff of TB cases on their wards, so that if they do become symptomatic in the coming months, and it may be many months later, they will be equipped with the necessary information to share with their treating clinicians.
 
I heard evidence that the NHS hospital’s Occupational Health team will issue contact tracing or warn and inform letters to staff, but this may not include Agency workers, and, in this case, Nurses seconded from the RAF. This is a missed opportunity to ensure that the relevant OH team or GP is aware of the potential exposure to add to the clinical picture should the patient develop atypical respiratory symptoms.
 
I understand that your agency has input into the UK’s TB Action Plan, and I hope that the above concerns can be considered in your drive to reduce the incidence of TB nationally, but also specifically with regard to healthcare professionals to ensure they are given the greatest possible protection from TB related harm and death.","Carrianne Franks died on 27 August 2021, at the Bassetlaw District Hospital, Nottinghamshire, as a result of Tuberculosis. She was a Flight Sergeant in the Royal Air Force Nursing Service.

The concerns raised were as follows:
 
Referral to Psychiatric Liaison Services for patients presenting with self-harm injuries and suicidal ideation (including those in Police custody) at Frimley Park Hospital A&E, including the extent to which the NICE guidance is complied with or provides effective guidance to staff in such circumstances.
The conduct of Mental Health Assessments in a custody setting by liaison and diversion staff including the adequacy of policy and guidelines relating to triggers to conduct such assessments and the manner in which refusals are dealt with.
The passage of information both between custody staff, as well as with healthcare staff in relation to concerns of a mental health nature for a detained person including the extent to which the custody record is used as an effective means to communicate concerns/observations of detained persons mental health.
The process of release of a vulnerable detained person following disposal, including interaction with family or other persons collecting the detained person.
 
I received further evidence in writing from the Interested Persons’ subsequent to the completion of the Inquest in relation to these concerns.
 
This evidence included responses from Hampshire Constabulary and Southern Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which have been put in place to address the failures identified during the course of the Inquest with respect to concerns at b – d (above). I was satisfied that these measures addressed the concerns in relation to each of these Interested Persons.
 
I also received evidence from the Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust concerning the measures which that organisation had undertaken in their area of responsibility to address my concern detailed at a (above). This evidence has not allayed my concern in relation to a (above).
 
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Evidence received from the police officers accompanying Mr. EVANS during his attendance at Frimley Park Hospital provided that:
 
a. Mr. EVANS presented with a large fresh cut on his arm and also cuts on his legs which were identified by him as being from self-harm with hospital staff noting that the larger mark on the arm might require stitching.
Police officers stated that Mr. EVANS was open with hospital staff about his feelings of self-harm depression, and thoughts of ending his own life. Officers further recalled that hospital staff noticed and commented on the self-harm marks on Mr. EVANS’ arms, including whilst staff were dressing a recent self- harm wound on Mr. EVANS’ left arm.
Officers also recalled Mr. EVANS commenting when offered food by hospital staff that he would rather starve to death.
One of the accompanying police officers expressed surprise at the fact that Mr. EVANS was not subject to a mental health referral or assessment, in the context of him commenting to multiple hospital staff members about his self-harm actions and ideation.
 
An emergency department consultant at Frimley Park gave evidence which suggested that no mental health assessment was or would have been necessary where Ryan’s presenting complaint was recorded as chest pains rather than of self- harm and/or suicidal ideation. Although self-harm had been noted in the records, no explanation could be provided for why Ryan’s suicidal ideation had not been recorded.
 
The consultant was further questioned in relation to the 2006 NICE Guidelines “Self-Harm: The short term physical and psychological management and secondary prevention of self-harm in primary and secondary care” which are national guidelines that ought to feed into practice at the hospital.
 
These guidelines provide that “Following triage patients who have self-harmed should receive the requisite treatment for their physical condition, undergo risk and full psychosocial needs assessment and mental state examination, and referral for further treatment and care as necessary” and “All people who have self harmed should be offered an assessment of needs, which should be comprehensive and include evaluation of the social, psychological and motivational factors specific to the act of self-harm, current suicidal intent and hopelessness, as well as a full mental health and social needs assessment.”
 
Evidence received during the course of the Inquest was not able to reconcile the contradiction between the NICE guidelines on self-harm and Mr. EVANS having had no mental health assessment despite obvious signs of self-harm and further evidence of disclosure of suicidal ideation.
 
The jury in their Narrative Conclusion found that ‘Despite evidence of self-harm, no mental health assessment was carried out at this point.’
 
I remain concerned as to how such a situation would be avoided if a patient presented again in similar manner to Mr. EVANS. The additional evidence on PFD matters provided by Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust does not refer to or address the NICE guidelines on self-harm or explain what would now be done differently were a patient such as Mr. EVANS were to be seen again.
 
The Frimley Health NHS Foundation Trust additional evidence refers to matters being in the process of introduction and new referral criteria with Surrey and Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, but this does not explain how this would prevent the future risk of a patient such as Mr. EVANS leaving the hospital without a mental health assessment.",On 4th April 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ryan John EVANS.
