Mia was found deceased at home by her parents around 6.50am on 12 March 2021 suspended from from a ligature.
 
Two undated notes in Mias handwrit ing were found on her bed on 12 March 2021 addressed to her family and friends, which explained that Mia had decided to end her life. Mias death was entirely unexpected by her family, friends and teachers. She had felt low self-esteem at times but had not been diagnosed with any mental illness nor presented a risk of taking her own life.
 
Mia had close friends including at her secondary school but she also experienced bullying behaviour from some male students. Neither Mias family nor teachers was aware of that behaviour before her death.
 
On 10 March 2021 Mia posted a video on social media asking two of these male students not to mock her and criticising their music and fashion. This video received a large number of hostile responses, which Mia found stressful. On the evening of 1 1 March 2021 Mia said to her parents that she had had a difficult week and asked to move to a different secondary school, which they agreed to explore.
 
Toxicological examination confirmed the absence of any illicit substances in Mias system. The post-mortem examination found marks of self-harm (recent and old) of which Mias family was not aware.
Mia is much missed by her loving family, friends and wider community who describe her as creative, kind, entrepreneurial and highly intelligent, amongst many other things.
 
The current head teacher of Mias secondary school – the Jewish Free School (JFS) – gave evidence at the final inquest hearing concerning systemic changes introduced at JFS following Mias death. This included a co mplete overhaul of safeguarding practices, increased behaviour management, improved information, staff surveys and externally delivered sessions by charities including Norwood, Streetwise, Jewish Womens Aid and Keshet.
 
Evidence provided by some JFS students after Mias death to the police and Ofsted described regular incidents of gender based bullying by some male JFS students of some female JFS students. Some of those child witnesses had not experienced a change in culture
at JFS since Mias death and did not describe being consulted or surveyed about the changes introduced by JFS.",,Mia Janin was born on 7 June 2006.

Public Inquiry
  
As part of the submission received to me from the Leonard family, it is said such are the matters of concern in the Inquest of Ben Leonard as to system issues relating to safety and safeguarding, that there is an urgent need for the establishment of a Public Inquiry under the Inquiries Act 2005 into The Scouts Association (be that statutory or non-statutory), and asking me to write to the relevant minister to request the establishment of a Public Inquiry. I have only considered the inquest relating to Ben Leonard and not wider cases. However, the matters of concern are below, and the relevant minister is sent this report to consider the issues and the request of the family.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Culture of Candour and Independent Inspection
 
I am concerned that there is not a culture of candour within The Scouts Association (‘TSA’) and the impact that this has on safety and safeguarding.
 
I am also concerned that, whilst the Charity Commission has regulatory oversight, there is no robust regulator who independently and periodically audits and inspects the systems, processes and training of The Scouts Association or the granting of permits for adventurous activities, hill walking and Nights Away permits. Further, The Scouts Association permit scheme for adventurous activities is exempt from regulation by the Health and Safety Executive (‘HSE’).
 
Fatal Accident Inquiry Panel Investigation Report (FAIP) now termed “Learning Review”
 
Following Ben’s death as indicated by Chapter 7 of The Scout’s Policy, Organisation and Rules, (Rule 7.2 version May 2018) at that time required the Charity and Company Secretary of the Association to establish an enquiry on behalf of the Board of Trustees. This should have detailed authorisation, training, equipment, briefing and leadership of the party involved together with their observation of the sequence of events and possible causes of the fatality.
 
As of 22.2.24, over 5 years since Ben’s death there is still no Fatal Accident Inquiry Panel Report in existence. Further still, even the prospective panel members for this investigation have not been identified. A document I have received entitled ‘BL Great Orme Learning and Actions Update’ dated
30.9.19 is inadequate when considering the root and branch type of review needed following a child fatality to identify and address issues of safety and safeguarding  –  particularly  these  having  been  identified  as significant
issues on the day of Ben’s death and despite this fact – no investigation",On the 28.8.18 the Court commenced an investigation into the death of Benjamin David Leonard (DOB 01.11.01).

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
It became evidence during the inquest that CMHT/ Crisis teams do not have contact details of:
Psychiatric liaison nurse services in neighbouring (out of their locality) boroughs based in Accident & Emergency departments, or details of
CMHT/ crisis teams in neighbouring boroughs.
 
Such contact could provide for direct referral, contact and passing on of knowledge of cases between neighbouring organisations, especially when individuals have already been assessed and asked to attend for a face-to-face consultation. Otherwise, those individuals who seek help, may have to revisit the same process of being interviewed on multiple occasions with a sense of déjà vu and anxiety that they are not obtaining the urgent assistance and support that they require. That may lead to them not engaging when they had hitherto made every attempt to do so.
 
To provide those contact details would seem a relatively simple task, so teams could contact each other, and the local psychiatric liaison nurses based within the A&Es.","On 27 November 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Oliver Beswetherick, aged 24 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
That in respect of GMP Call Handler’s being required to call an ambulance to attend the scene, even where it is reported that someone is “dead” there has been no institutional learning following this incident. I asked [REDACTED] if there had been any learning, reflection or training since this incident. He said that there hadn’t on this issue.
 
That the training delivered to the first two attending officers did not adequately prepare them for responding to a scene where someone is found hanging in a way which is consistent with their priority to preserve life of a hanging casualty.
 
I heard evidence from Detective Superintendent [REDACTED] that both attending officers were part of a cohort of at least 650 officers within GMP (and a larger cohort nationally) who received their initial police training entirely online. I am concerned that both officers’ training on Sudden Death (and the training of others) was delivered as one of over 15 online modules on a given day and that at the time of the inquest, they had not received any classroom based or on the job training. I am concerned that they are not the only officers within GMP who have received this level/method of training input and therefore there is a risk that other officers on duty have inadequate training on this issue.
 
4. There was evidence given to me by Detective Superintendent [REDACTED] that there is an unknown number of GMP officers who are not meeting the expectation of receiving First Aid refresher training within 12 months, which since May 2022 has included training on how to resuscitate a hanging casualty. I am therefore concerned that there remains a cohort of officers who have not had the post May 2022 training that includes how to provide Basic Life Support to this kind of casualty until the arrival of an ambulance.","On the 25th October 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samuel Curless (Sam).

His discharge conditions included that he should notify the authorities of any developing relationships. He failed to notify the authorities that he had begun a relationship with Sobhia, and after the relationship had been ongoing for around a year he persuaded her to move from Bradford to Derby. Within little more than 5 weeks of her doing so he brutally murdered her. He ran a defence of diminished responsibility but was convicted of her murder. At the time of the murder [REDACTED] was being supervised by numerous agencies: the police, social services, the community mental health team, MAPPA, and the Ministry of Justice. That he was nonetheless able to form a relationship with Sobhia in secret, and to murder her, was surprising and concerning. This formed the focus on my inquest.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Scrutiny of s.41 MHA 1983 cases by the Mental Health Tribunal. In this case [REDACTED] was discharged by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) following the receipt of reports from Cygnet Hospital which were inadequate and misrepresented the progress he had made and the risk that he posed. Nonetheless there were indicators which should have led the MoJ to question whether this case should have been referred to a Mental Health Tribunal, such as [REDACTED] minimising his culpability for his previous offending. The offences against his former wife were of the utmost gravity, particularly in the context of his behaviour during the marriage that she later disclosed. This indicated a risk of such a level as to make it not only desirable but essential that discharge was not contemplated until there had been close and careful scrutiny by those with expertise in forensic risk assessment. The MoJ Guidance on restricted patients says that “the vast majority” of discharge decisions are made by the Tribunal. In a patient with risk profile it is difficult to envisage circumstances whereby that should have been displaced.
 
Ensuring that s.41 restricted patients are supervised under a forensic pathway. In this case no such pathway even existed in the locality. This meant that Mustafa’s supervision was inadequate having regard to the risk that he posed. Such orders are imposed to protect the public from the risk of serious harm. Even where it has been adjudged that any previous offending would not have happened but for a mental disorder, there is still the need for a forensic approach. The risk component must not be overlooked as it was here. Forensic pathways must be available across the country.
 
Police power to arrest where there is a reason to believe a person is at risk of death/serious injury. Whilst I was critical of the failure of the police to take measures that were reasonably available to them to investigate the intelligence that had been received that [REDACTED] was in a relationship, the one power that was not available to them was to arrest him. This leaves a significant gap in the powers that are available to the police to protect individuals who are at risk of death/serious injury. Although I cannot say whether the threshold would have been met in Sobhia’s case, such a power could in future cases ensure that it is understood that where an individual poses a significant risk of causing serious harm in relationships, and there is evidence that he is concealing a relationship, he can be arrested.
 
Ministry of Justice power to recall where a patient poses a significant risk to the public. The MoJ will not generally recall dangerous individuals unless there is a decline in their mental health presentation notwithstanding the fact that s.41 MHA 1983, to which [REDACTED] was subject, is designed to protect the public from serious harm. Whilst there is the possibility of the judge imposing a hybrid order, and that was not considered appropriate in this case, it did not mean that [REDACTED] risk only existed in the context of a decline in his mental health. If an individual subject to a s.41 restriction order poses a significant risk to the public then the public can only be protected if he can be recalled to hospital where further assessment can be undertaken. If it then transpires that, as likely was the case here, the mental health component had previously been exaggerated, this would at the very least allow for a discharge plan to then be prepared which takes account of this and ensures that there is adequate focus on managing the risk. One way of achieving this would be a power to arrest being attached to the patient’s discharge conditions, enforceable where there is a significant risk of serious harm.
 
Travel overseas for s.41  restricted patients. [REDACTED]was permitted to travel to and from Pakistan freely and to return seemingly as and when he saw fit. Whilst he was outside the jurisdiction there was no way of checking on him, including in terms of his mental health, but also his risk. There were concerns, for example, that he may have been arranging a forced marriage for his niece. He could have entered into a relationship, for all the authorities knew. It also allowed him an opportunity to push and test the boundaries. He was permitted to travel out of the jurisdiction as he pleased, sometimes returning late, sometimes early. By contrast, had he been on licence after serving a custodial sentence, he would in all probability have been prevented from travelling outside the jurisdiction, at least in the early stages. Whilst I acknowledge that there are qualitative differences between a prison sentence and a hospital order, it remains legitimate if not necessary to ensure that those who have recently discharged from a s.41 order are carefully monitored, in the jurisdiction, at least for the first 12 months. This is beneficial not only in terms of monitoring mental health, but also risk.
 
Clinicians should be provided with full reports when considering discharge. This was a particular concern in relation to the fact that those recommending discharge were not provided with the full Spousal Assault Risk Assessment, but only a summary. Given [REDACTED] risk profile, and the catastrophic consequences that were liable to result from him being pre-emptively discharged, and that discharge was being recommended without recourse to the Tribunal, it was essential that the s.117 meeting was informed by detailed reports which, had they been properly considered, would have indicated a need for circumspection.
 
Over-reliance on self-reporting. This was a theme that ran throughout the inquest and the various agencies involved. This was a case that required a forensic approach throughout, both in hospital and in the community. It was recognised that [REDACTED] was narcissistic and manipulative but he was nonetheless relied upon to provide updates as to his mental health, his travel plans and the reasons for them, and – critically – whether or  not  he [REDACTED]  was  in a relationship. [REDACTED] risk arose primarily in the context of relationships and he was not somebody that could be relied upon to disclose them. On the contrary, he had shown himself willing and adept at concealing them. This underlined why his self-reporting could not be relied upon and this was something that should have featured in his management throughout, and flagged at the point of discharge.
 
Record-keeping. This was a thread that ran through the case and applied both to the clinical notes but also the notes of meetings, such as MAPPA, which are necessarily a summary but which did not always include sufficient information to enable those reviewing them to understand what had been discussed and what actions taken. In terms of clinical records, whilst basic, mundane matters such as his sleeping habits and appetite were recorded, much of what mattered was not. The paucity of records and the  poverty of their quality  meant that [REDACTED] was not aware of the history of manipulation and the other factors which indicated an ample need for reassessment. In terms of the SOTP, whereas there was a conflict of evidence as to why the group programme was not available at Cygnet hospital, the keeping of proper records would have ensured that there was a ready answer if needed. The discharge meetings were poorly recorded, with the spousal assault risk assessment not having featured at all. There were repeated instances of witnesses not being able to remember, understandably, what had happened with respect to certain events. There was no excuse for professional witnesses to be put in this embarrassing position. The MoJ are reliant on what they are told in writing, but given that there is a culture of poor record- keeping, until and unless that record-keeping is improved to an acceptable level, they have to be more pro-active and more prepared to question things.
 
i. Familiarisation of professionals with cultural issues. In this case there appears  to have been a reluctance to make enquiries with the Mosque and the Islamic Meat Centre, and to be aware of how the family dynamics are impacted by cultural issues. Although it was intended that a family tree would be completed, and this should have been done pre-discharge, [REDACTED] was able to some extent to throw a curtain around his family and thereby prevent those working with him from understanding the lengths they were prepared to go to protect him. It was noted that him becoming the Head of the family after his father’s death was significant, but the wider consequences were not properly considered.","On 28 May 2017 an investigation was commenced into the death of Sobhia Tabasim Khan, aged 37.   The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 February 2024.   The conclusion of the inquest was unlawful killing.

He developed epilepsy from the age of 6 years and had a diagnosis of Lennox-Gestaut syndrome for which he was under the care of the Department of Neurology at Royal Stoke University Hospital. In 2019 the Department of Neurology commenced Mr Burgess on 2.5ml twice daily Brivaracetam to control his seizure activity. The dosage was increased to 10ml twice a day in 2020 and responsibility for prescribing the medication was transferred to Mr. Burgess’ General Practitioner at the Brook Medical Centre, Bradeley, Stoke-On- Trent. The reason for the change in prescriber was for the sake of convenience as the GP were the prescriber for other medications.   Although the Brook Medical Centre were responsible for prescribing Brivaracetam there were no consultations between the surgery and Mr. Burgess or his mother regarding the management of his seizures or a review of medication, these continued to be undertaken by the Department of Neurology at the Royal Stoke University Hospital.   In July 2020 the Consultant Neurologist agreed with Mr. Burgess’ mother that the dosage of Brivaracetam should be reduced by 2ml every 2 weeks and to be reviewed in 4 months. A letter was sent from the Department of Neurology at Royal Stoke University Hospital to the Brook Medical Centre advising of this planned reduction. No amendment to the prescription was requested and no changes were made following the letter. The remained as Brivaracetam 10ml twice daily.
 
In November 2020 a letter was sent from the Department of Neurology at Royal Stoke University Hospital to the Brook Medical Centre advising that the dose of Brivaracetam had been reduced to 3ml twice daily but then back up to 5ml twice daily. No amendment to the prescription was requested and no changes were made following the letter.
 
In January 2021 a letter was sent from the Department of Neurology to the Brook Medical Centre advising that the dose of Brivaracetam was at 4ml twice daily and the deceased’s seizures were “relatively stable”. No amendment to the prescription was requested and no changes were made following the letter. The prescription remained as Brivaracetam 10ml twice daily.
 
On 22 July 2022 Mr. Burgess was moved out of his parent’s care by Stoke-on-Trent social services into a supportive living placement in Leicestershire run by Godfey Care. This was undertaken on an emergency basis. When Mr. Burgess arrived at the placement it was reported by staff that the medication bottles were unlabeled and so could not be given to Mr Burgess until confirmation of the prescription was received in writing by the prescriber. The evidence at inquest was that this was a Care Quality Commission requirement.
 
The deceased did not receive any Brivaracetam between 22 July 2022 and 26 July 2022.
 
On 25 July 2022 a “Best Interests Meeting” was undertaken involving Mr Burgess’ mother, Godfrey care and social services during which the Mr Burgess’ mother advised that the correct dosage of Brivaracetam was 4ml twice daily and not 10ml twice daily. The same information was provided by the Department of Neurology to Godfrey Care however the medication was not provided as the information regarding the correct dose had not been provided by the prescriber.
 
On 26 July 2022 the deceased was given Brivaracetam 10ml twice daily. The evidence at inquest was that this was likely due to a manager from Godfrey Care being given the prescription details during a call to the 111 service.
 
On 27 July 2022 a letter was sent from the Department of Neurology to the Brook Medical Centre explaining that Mr Burgess had been moved to a care organisation on an urgent basis and there was confusion over what medication he should be taking. A request was made to forward a list of his medication but also included information from his last review within the Department of Neurology that Brivaracetam at 4ml twice daily was the appropriate dose.
 
On 28 July 2022 the Brook Medical Centre sent a list of prescribed medication to Godfrey Care. As there had been no changes to prescription since July 2020 the recorded prescribed dose of Brivaracetam was 10ml twice daily although the dose that he has been given during the preceding 2 years was 4ml twice daily.
 
Mr Burgess continued to receive Brivaracetam at dose of 10ml twice daily until 5 September 2022 when he was seen in a clinic at Department of Neurology at Leicester Glenfield Hospital and established that there had been a sudden increase in the Brivaracetam dose from 4ml twice daily to 10ml twice daily. The plan was for the medication to be reduced to 9ml twice daily and then to continue to reduce by 1ml twice daily at weekly intervals until he was back to the “well tolerated” dose of 4ml twice daily.
 
Prior to 22 July 2022 whilst being given Brivaracetam at 4ml twice daily Mr Burgess experienced 5-6 seizures per week. Following the cessation of medication between 22-26 July 2022 and the increase in Brivaracetam to 10ml twice daily he was experiencing about 5 seizures per day and of longer duration.
 
The medication was reduced as per the instruction from Department of Neurology at Leicester Glenfield Hospital. On 23 September 2022 Mr Burgess was taken back into care of his mother. Although there had been a hospital attendance on the on 15 November 2022 the seizures had stablised to a similar frequency as before the sudden interruption and increase in medication.
 
On 19 November 2022 Mr. Burgess was sadly found unresponsive at his home address with death being verified by attending paramedic. He had passed away after vomiting and aspirating during an epileptic seizure.","Although not causative in Mr. Burgess death during the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
The Neurology department of the Royal Stoke University Hospital operated a system whereby it did not instruct the prescribing GP to amend the prescription of Brivaracetam when changes to dosage had been agreed with Mr Burgess’ mother.  The evidence from the Consultant Neurologist was that an assumption was made that when changes to medication had been discussed and agreed that Mr Burgess’ mother would attend the GP surgery to discuss the changes in medication. The same witness gave evidence that it was assumed a pharmacist within the GP surgery would read the correspondence from the neurology department and make the necessary changes to prescriptions without express instructions to do so.
 
The “workflow” within the Brook Medical Centre was such that letters sent from the Neurology department discussing changes in medication (albeit not containing a request to amend the prescription) were processed by support staff and not referred to a clinician to consider and so no changes were made to the prescription.
 
The letter of 27 July 2022 from the Neurology department to Brook Medical Centre seeking clarification as to the correct dosage of Brivaracetam was processed by support staff and a summary medications sent without referral to a clinician.
 
Godfrey Care were informed by Mr Burgess’ mother and the Neurology department of Royal Stoke University that the appropriate dose of Brivaracetam was 4ml twice daily. Medication was withheld between 22-26 July 2022 due to the information not being in writing from the prescriber, however the evidence at inquest was that 10ml twice daily was

On 15th July 2023 she was served a drink in a beaker cup the temperature of which had not been adequately checked by a staff member.
 
The evidence heard at the inquest was that a ‘warm drink’ would be comprised of ‘aired water’ topped by cold water and that a member of staff would check the temperature of the cup/beaker by way of applying their wrist to the same.
 
Blanche was not assisted with the beaker and it spilled causing her to suffer burns which upon assessment by a General Practitioner led to admission to hospital in the early hours of 16th July 2023. It was wholly apparent from the injuries that Blanche suffered that the temperature of the drink had not been checked in an adequate manner.

She had no active symptoms of these conditions until 2021 and until November 2022 her symptoms had been managed in primary care services with medication.
 
Naz’s referral into secondary mental health services in November 2022 followed notification by the DWP that she would have her universal credit reviewed, by the Performance Review Team.
 
Naz’s mental health deteriorated necessitating a period of informal admission to the Bradgate Unit on the 5th December 2022 and she was diagnosed with Adjustment Disorder, an excessive reaction to stress that involves negative thoughts, strong emotions and changes in a person’s behaviour. I heard evidence from a Consultant Psychiatrist that the trigger stressor for this was the DWP performance review, suggested overpayment and potential debt.
 
It took 6 months for the DWP review to be completed. During which time there:
were at least 6 missed opportunities to use an additional support tab on Naz’s DWP profile to record the details of her vulnerability and alert other DWP personnel.
was a failure to pass vital information between the performance review team and universal credit case handling team of the need to correspond with Naz’s daughter, because corresponding with Naz was of serous detriment to her mental health.
 
Naz’s mental health was managed throughout this time by the secondary heath teams, and for the majority by the Crisis Resolution & Home Treatment team. The Crisis team were responsive throughout this time to Naz’s fluctuating symptoms and needs.
 
In the 4 weeks prior to the paracetomol overdose, despite a request for all correspondence to be directed through her daughter, Naz received 6 communications from the DWP, 2 telephone calls requiring detailed information of Naz, a journal log she didn’t understand and 3 separate letters which had a cumulative increase of the amount Naz owed of 75%.
 
6 days after receiving the last piece of correspondence from the DWP Naz took an overdose [REDACTED]. Those mental health professionals who had worked with Naz throughout 7 months in which her mental health had deteriorated gave evidence to me that the recurrent and predominant cause of Naz’s increased anxiety was the DWP performance review.

Despite the DWP case workers and call handlers having the availability of an additional  support tab on a profile of a customer on the DWP computer system; there were 6 missed opportunities to use this facility to record vital information about Naz’s vulnerability; despite Naz being tearful and distressed on the telephone on more than one occasion and advising the DWP of information surrounding her mental health and her inability to cope. This meant there was no alert to DWP staff of Naz’s vulnerability and consequently no adjustment to how communication was made with Naz. The trigger for mental health decline and Adjustment Disorder continued.",On 28 June 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nazerine Frances Anderson aged 52. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 12 February 2024. The conclusion of the inquest was that:   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by April 09, 2024.

A single working diagnosis of an upper arm DVT was made by the Emergency Department consultant on call. The Emergency Department was exceptionally busy that night and there were delays in obtaining blood test results, CT scans, escalating Mr Nye’s case to the Intensive Care Unit team and prescribing antibiotics or any other treatment to target sepsis from skin and soft tissue infection. Mr Nye’s condition was observed to deteriorate at about 23.45 and he went into cardiac arrest at about 01.20am on 15th November 2022. A return of spontaneous circulation was achieved after about 3 minutes, but after a CT scan at about 03.00 Mr Nye suffered a further cardiac arrest and resuscitation attempts were unsuccessful. His death was verified at 04.05 on 15th November 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
Delays in blood tests being completed at night at the Royal Berkshire Hospital, and notification to clinicians on the Electronic Patient Record of abnormal results which are being reviewed.;
The burdensome and time consuming out of hours system for clinicians requesting CT scans from an external provider;
The lack of contemporaneous record keeping in the Emergency Department;
The lack of a specific night time Internal Escalation Policy. A number of the general Internal Escalation Policy measures are not effective at night;
The need for training of all Intensive Care Unit clinicians at all levels, both existing Intensive Care Unit clinicians and new joiners, in the policy that a “just to let you know” call should result in an Intensive Care review of the patient;
The need for training and education of all clinicians on atypical presentation of sepsis and the need for a high index of suspicion for sepsis, particularly in the presence of a high lactate.",On 18 November 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael James NYE aged 48.

62,21/02/2024,12/02/2024,2024-0075,Natalie Mountford,Mr Brendan Joseph Allen,Area Coroner,Dorset,Road (Highways Safety) related deaths,Dorset Council,1,0,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/natalie-mountford-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Natalie-Mountford-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2024-0075_Published.pdf,,"Shortly after midnight on 18th December 2022, Natalie Chistina Mountford was travelling from Shaftesbury to Sturminster Newton on the B3019 in her Vauxhall Astra, when she came across a single vehicle road traffic collision in the St James’ Common area: a Vauxhall Corsa, driven by [REDACTED], had lost control on ice that was present on the B3091 and collided with one or both verges, coming to rest in the opposing lane, with the front of the vehicle pointing into the verge. Ms Mountford came to [REDACTED] assistance, and invited her to sit in the rear of her Astra to keep warm while they awaited the Emergency Services. Ms Mountford remained outside of the vehicle. Shortly thereafter, [REDACTED], driving a Citreon Berlingo, again travelling from Shaftesbury in the direction of Sturminster Newton, tried to stop at the scene, but lost control of his vehicle on the ice that was present on the road. He elected to mount the verge to drive around the passenger side of Astra. As he died so, Ms Mountord walked around the front of her vehicle and she was struck by the Berlingo. Ms Mountford died at the scene as a consequence of the injuries she sustained.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
During the inquest evidence was heard that:
 
There have been multiple road traffic collisions on this section of road within the seven years prior to Ms Mountford’s tragic death, including another fatality in December 2017 caused by the presence of ice on this section of the road.
When Dorset Council highways inspections take place, the Inspectors will not consider or potentially investigate the possible source(s) of water running or on or across a road. While it is accepted that there will often be occasions where the source of the water will be obvious (eg excessive rain fall), there may be occasions where the water is emanating from a source where remedial action can be taken to prevent the continued flow of water on to the road.","On the 22nd December 2022, an investigation was commenced into the death of Natalie Christina Mountford, born on the 9th March 1977.   The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 5th February 2024. 
The Medical Cause of Death was: 
1a Multiple Injuries Consistent with a Road Traffic Collision

As you can see the jury have referenced the police’s knowledge of ABD in their conclusion.,"The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
At the inquest all the police officers who attended MB gave evidence and they all stated under oath that they did not consider that MB was suffering from ABD at the time.  However, when completing the Use of Force forms afterwards, all bar one of the officers involved in restraint indicated that ABD had been an impact factor. There is an ambiguity which could not be properly explored at the inquest, largely due to the passage of time.
 
However, this suggests that officers may have thought about ABD but did not mention it to others, which would be contrary to the “Speak Up and Speak Out” principle.
 
This is a principle, the inquest heard, that is critical to ensuing that the voices of junior officers are heard in these difficult and potentially life-threatening situations.","On 25/02/2021, an investigation was opened touching upon the death of Mouayed Mamoun Bashir.   ","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.
 
I should be grateful if the following information be provided to me:
 
Confirmation as to whether the training on ABD has been reviewed and the principle of “Speak Up and Speak Out” enshrined therein, reflecting the acknowledged difficulties in identifying ABD even by experienced officers.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 08 April 2024.

This was investigated by x-ray and fluoroscopy at the time, but the object was not detected and he was then without symptoms for the next 14 months until his emergency admission to hospital on 26 April 2023.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
In February 2022, Kazarie was taken to hospital suspected of having swallowed a plastic foreign object. He then underwent an x-ray and a fluoroscopy, each with a negative result.
 
It was suggested to me in evidence that children suspected of having swallowed a non radio opaque object such as a googly eye, whose symptoms (unlike Kazarie’s) persist, should undergo an endoscopy even if they have had a negative x-ray and fluoroscopy.
 
I was told that there is a lack of national guidance for such a situation. I appreciate that there are multiple considerations in planning investigations, such as the risks associated with CT scanning and the risks associated with the administration of a general anaesthetic. It seems that the matter would benefit from consideration at a national level.","On 12 May 2023, one of my assistant coroners, Richard Brittain, commenced an investigation into the death of Kazarie Dwaah-Lyder, aged 2½ years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest earlier today. I made a determination of accidental death.

1a       upper gastrointestinal bleed and haemorrhagic shock 1b    oesophageal tear extending to the aorta

He lived at [REDACTED],  Carlisle. Mr
Godderidge was frail and suffered from short-term memory loss. On 16th February 2023 a fire broke out at Mr Godderidge’s home. He died as a result of smoke inhalation. Prior to Mr Godderidge’s death repeated concerns had been raised about his risk of causing a fire. He repeatedly discarded lit cigarettes and had the habit of cutting paper into strips, which provided a ready source of fuel for a fire.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
During the inquest I heard from the carers who worked with Mr Godderidge. They reported to me that when concerns are raised about a service-user’s capacity there is not reliable and routine liaison between Adult Social Care and the care providers. I am concerned that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths. Care workers are very likely to see  a service user more often than others. They have a particularly valuable perspective as to a person’s capacity. If their observations are not being considered then opportunities to provide care to vulnerable people may well be missed.
Mr Godderidge’s carers also reported to me that in their experience consideration of capacity by Adult Social Care does not always reflect the possibility that a person’s capacity may be variable and fluctuating. I am concerned that this gives rise to a risk of future deaths if a person is considered on a ‘good day’ without understanding that their presentation fluctuates substantially over time.","On 3 March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the  death  of  Thomas  GODDERIDGE.

He lived in Workington, Cumbria. Mr Bates had a past medical history of drug misuse. On 31st August 2023 Mr Bates’ body was discovered at his home. Ambulance staff were unable to revive Mr Bates and his death was confirmed at 11:50. A post mortem examination has confirmed that his death was caused by the combined effect of heroin, bromazolam, protonitazene, xylazine and alcohol.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Mr Bates had a prescription for methadone issued by Recovery Steps. He was required to collect a dose each day from a named pharmacy. On 14th July 2023 Mr Bates stopped collecting methadone. The pharmacy explained that they sought to inform Recovery Steps of this development shortly after 14th but did not have any contact details other than a general number which is not always answered and a direct line for one key worker. They attempted to raise their concerns with that key worker, but the message appears not to have been relayed. Recovery Steps did not become aware that Mr Bate was not collecting methadone until 30th August 2023.
 
In answer to question from the Court, the pharmacy have also indicated that although it is there practice to inform Recovery Steps of any other concerns they might have about a person prescribed with methadone, this is a voluntary decision on their part and not a matter that arises from any obligation.
 
I am concerned that this situation gives rise to a risk of future death. It appears that there is no direct means by which a pharmacy can report to Recovery Steps that a service user has stopped collecting methadone. There is also no apparent obligation on pharmacies to report wider concerns for service users’ welfare to Recovery Steps. In each case this may mean that Recovery Steps are unaware that vulnerable service users require additional support.","On 8 September 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Dayle BATES.

She was taken to Hull Royal Infirmary and she was seen in A&E, the Acute Medical Unit, Frailty Assessment Unit for assessment but was deemed too poorly for that ward and was transferred to Ward 90.She had sustained rib fractures which had caused a pneumothorax and she had other co morbidities which were treated on Ward 90. The rib fractures caused an infection to develop in her lungs and Mrs Reed developed pneumonia. Whilst on ward 90 she began physiotherapy and was mobilising and able to eat and drink with minimal support. She was assessed as medically fit for discharge on 3rd February 2023, but she required more physiotherapy and support and so was transferred to a new no criteria to reside ward, Ward H130E in Hull Royal Infirmary. Whilst on Ward H130E Mrs Reed contracted Covid-19. (positive PCR 19/02/23, negative 23/02/23) and this set her discharge back as she had been planned for discharge to a residential rehab setting on 19/02/23. Mrs Reed was seen by the medical team on 24/02/23 as nursing staff had concerns. Mrs Reed was visibly dehydrated, drowsy, tachycardic and her blood tests showed signs of infection. She was assessed as now not medically fit for discharge however instead of being transferred on to a medical ward she was discharged on 26th February 29023 to Holy Name Community Rehab Centre in Hull. She was not medically fit for discharge and indeed should not have been discharged. The fact that she was very poorly was recognised as such upon arrival at the centre. The centre staff requested an urgent medical review and Mrs
Reed was placed on end of life care and very sadly died on 2nd March 2023 in the centre.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
H130 is on the 13th floor of Hull Royal Infirmary. It has an East and a West wing and spans the full floor. It was opened in response to winter pressures. At that time, in January 2023, Hull Royal Infirmary was placed under significant pressure in terms of admissions and staffing. The ward been open only a matter of some two weeks by the time Mrs Reed was transferred to that ward. Despite being medically fit for discharge upon arrival on that ward Mrs Reed’s condition worsened and family raised concerns as best they could but they reported that the ward was chaotic and that staff would tell them they had only just found out they were working on the ward before their shift started and there was no consistency of nursing staff on the ward.
 
Mrs Reed was dehydrated and family report that there was a paucity of personal care afforded on that ward. There was a risk of cross infection as patients’ personal effects such as toiletries were not with the right patients and had to be located by family. There was no established cohort of permanent staff on the ward at that time and no signposting to the ward sister or matron and therefore no way of patents, their friends, or their families being able to have a clear escalation pathway to ventilate concerns. Although HUTH now have an established team and leadership chain on Ward H130 there is a real concern that wards opened in response to winter pressures in the future in any busy hospital may give rise to the same peripatetic staffing regime, that is to say, agency staff and no fixed team in place and a lack of visible leadership. This could lead to the deterioration of patients not being recognised if there is no continuity of care by the same team of nursing staff.","On 7th March 2023, an inquest was opened and adjourned into the death of Ethel Doreen Reed aged 93 years.

He used alcohol to excess and prescribed medication to try and deal with his post- traumatic stress disorder. On 6th May 2023 he collapsed on Malvern Road, Old Trafford. Attempts to resuscitate him were unsuccessful. Post- mortem examination found he had developed alcohol related liver disease which had led to left ventricular hypertrophy and an acute left ventricular failure exacerbated by combined drug toxicity.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The inquest heard evidence that James Day had served his country as a member of the armed services. He had been deployed to Afghanistan as part of his service where he had witnessed traumatic events that had led to him developing post-traumatic stress disorder. He needed support to help him deal with the trauma. However that had not been provided in such a way whilst he was serving to allow him to deal with his PTSD. He had subsequently left the army and had continued to struggle to cope with his PTSD. He used alcohol and prescribed medication to try and cope with the severe symptoms of his PTSD.
 
The inquest heard that support for service personnel with severe PTSD such as Mr Day whilst they were still serving and following discharge was patchy, difficult to access and did not appear to recognise how significant the impact of events they had witnessed whist serving could be on their mental health.
 
The inquest heard that better mental health support whilst serving and following discharge may have avoided Mr Day having to turn to self- medication to try and have respite from his PTSD symptoms.",On 9th May 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of James Colin Day.

He got up in the night to pass water due to his overactive bladder and fell out of bed. He hit his head ( suffered abrasion) he did not lose consciousness and was alert and talking when police and fire came to assist as his brother could not get him back into bed. Ambulance was contacted however there was a delay of around 9 hours until their arrival.
Ambulance crew came to do a courtesy visit the following morning and he was found in bed GCS 3 and covered in his own vomit. CT head showed cerebral haemorrhage.
CT head findings discussed with neurosurgeons who said this man would not be for surgical intervention
He sadly passed away in hospital on 1st November 2021. The Inquest focused upon:-
The events of 30 October 2021 and leading to admission
 
whether any delay in admission to hospital and medical treatment was causative (more than minimally contributory) to death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
A script used by Operators within WAST as part of the Clinical Safety Plan inform callers not to call back for an estimated time of arrival of the ambulance. They are told to only call back if there is a deterioration in the patient’s condition.
 
During periods of a delayed response from an ambulance, WAST best practice is for an Operator to maintain regular contact with callers to assess any change in their condition. During periods of excessive demand, it is considered that this is not always achievable, and therefore Welfare calls are prioritised to callers considered vulnerable.
 
There may be a risk that callers do not understand the instruction to only call back if there is a deterioration, and/or may not recognise a deterioration, and feel they cannot call WAST again. There is a further risk that unless regular welfare calls are made during periods of delayed response, there is a missed opportunity to properly re-assess and re- grade the response to a call by WAST.",On 5 November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Brian JAMES . The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 11/01/2024. The conclusion of the inquest was Mr James died following a fall at his home. A delay in ambulance response and admission may have affected the treatment available to Mr James.   ,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 4 April 2024.

He had a long-term history of drug and alcohol misuse and was alcohol dependent. He had been arrested and detained in police custody on 4th September.
 
Mr Pryor was seen in police custody by Health Care Professionals (HCP’s) due to his documented opiate misuse, methadone usage and alcohol dependency. Mr Pryor was attended on four separate occasions by two different HCP’s whilst in custody. He was recognised to be dependent on alcohol and when he began to exhibit symptoms of withdrawal a HCP began a course of alcohol withdrawal medication to reduce the symptoms and guard against possible alcohol withdrawal related seizure.
 
The inquest jury returned the following conclusion: –
 
‘Mr Pryor suffered an alcohol withdrawal related seizure whilst detained in police custody which caused cardiorespiratory arrest and death. There were deficiencies in the health care professionals’ assessment and treatment of Mr Pryor’s alcohol withdrawal which probably made a more than minimal contribution to his death’.
 
The jury recorded the following findings: –
 
‘The HCP assessments were not of a reasonable standard due to the following reasons:
 
Assessments provided were substantially shorter than the recognised accepted practice and consistently shorter than would have been required to properly assess Mr Pryor effectively. In addition to this the time between assessments was too long, particularly after the critical dose of the withdrawal medication was administered, to ascertain the effectiveness.
 
Assessments were lacking in consistent information i.e. BP, pulse, heart rate and history. Previous assessments were not referenced prior to each visit, changes in vital signs were not acted upon.
 
Assessment records were inadequate and lacking in detail.
 
There was a point at which an increase in the withdrawal medication dose should have been
considered when Mr Pryor’s BP and pulse were not taken and found to be elevated. …..
 
Although not demonstrably contributory to Mr Pryor’s death, the jury records the following matters:
 
There were inadequacies in the training and induction provided to the lesser experienced HCP who attended Mr Pryor.
 
It is also clear that the lesser experienced HCP did not have suitable experience and skills to work as an HCP’.
 
The lesser experienced HCP had previously worked as a mental health nurse.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
I am concerned that Health Care Professionals (HCPs) may not be receiving sufficient and adequate training to enable them to practice effectively or safely in police custody suites. This is based on the evidence and findings in Mr Pryor’s inquest and my understanding that the training provided by HCRG may be very similar to that given by other providers of HCP police custody services nationally.",On 07 September 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mark PRYOR aged 46. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 01 February 2024.  The conclusion of the jury was: ,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.

Since O’Shea’s death London Ambulance Service has added “JRCALC Plus” guidance stating where delivery is not progressing the patient should be conveyed to a hospital with obstetric support.,"The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1. Consideration to be given for the national JRCALC guidance to include the London Ambulance Service’s JRCALC Plus recommendation that where delivery is not progressing the patient should be conveyed to an obstetrics unit;","On the 27th May 2022 I opened an investigation touching the death of O’Shea Medad Dover who was 1 month old when he died. I opened an inquest on the 26th of September 2022, the inquest concluded on the 1st of February 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was the following narrative.
Laura was 30 weeks pregnant when she experienced abdominal pain and called emergency services. The call was wrongly categorised so paramedics arrived 44 minutes later than should have been the case. Midwifery advice was for the paramedics to bring Laura to hospital because pre-term deliveries require full obstetric and neonatal support. They did not follow this advice for three reasons…
 
They thought Laura was soon to deliver – a conclusion they’d be less likely to have reached had the call been correctly categorised and they’d been with her 44 minutes earlier;
Extrication from the property was challenging.
LAS guidance told them not to extricate if delivery is thought to be imminent.
 
Recognising the seriousness of the situation two midwifes came to Laura. They deemed her presentation to be more in keeping with placental abruption than imminent delivery and assisted paramedics in extrication Laura and taking her to hospital at 22.30. At 22.44, there was no foetal heart rate. At 23.04 O’Shea was delivered, resuscitation was started and caused a return of spontaneous circulation at
23.12. Given these things, it is likely O’Shea was subjected to acute severe hypoxia between 22.14 and 22.19. If the call to emergency services had been correctly categorised, Laura would have probably been in hospital by 20.57, Hme enough for CTG monitoring to recognise foetal distress prior to the hypoxia at 22.14 which would have prompted emergency caesarian. Had this happened it’s likely O’Shea would have survived.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Thursday the Twenty-Fifth of April 2024 I, the assistant coroner, may extend the period.

Fm  much of his life Mr Ogbe-Millar was a heavy cannabis user, which led to his diagnosis with cannabis induced psychosis in 2020.
 
Mr Ogbe-Millar received treatment from community and in-patient mental health teams at various stages, including two hospital admissions under the Mental Health Act 1933 in late 2020 and in early 2021.
 
On being discharged from hospital in March 2021 he enjoyed a period free of cannabis and psychosis. He was able to work, attend Narcotics Anonymous and come off his medication _ This led to his discharge from the community mental health team in June 2021.
 
In November 2021 Mr Ogbe-Millar gave up his job and resumed using cannabis on a daily basis leading to a relapse of h is mental illness. His mother sought help from the community mental health team who spoke to Mr Ogbe-Millar by telephone on 26 November 2021 and referred him to a substance abuse organisation, which did 11ot specialise in psychosis. He was discharged by the community health team on 30  November  2021,  without  the  team  having obtained any information regarding his relapse from his mother.
 
In the early  hours of 2 December 2021, Mr Ogbe-Millar sent a text message to his mother saying:  “I’m sorry for my actions and I hope you all find peace”. His mother immediately telephoned the police who found Mr Ogbe-Millar at home [REDACTED]. 
 
The police took Mr Ogbe-Millar to the Emergency Department of Watford General Hospital, which is operated by West Hertfordshire Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust (‘WHTHN T’) where there  was  all  inadequate  system  for  recording the information provided by the police to the hospital concerning his risk of self­ harm.
 
Mr Ogbe-Millar was assessed by hospital staff later that morning as a moderate risk of self-harm and told to await the arrival of the local Mental Health Liaison Team, which is operated by the Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust (‘HPUNFT’)
 
Despite Mr Ogbe-Millar’s risk of self-harm and the protective factor provided by the presence of his mother, she was not allowed to stay with him at the
Emergrency Department while he waited for the Mental Health Liaison Team. Instead, she was required to leave, by staff in breach of hospital policy
 
The Mental Health Liaison Team had not arrived to assess Mr Ogbe-Millar by the time his mother was required to leave the hospital due to problems surrounding the referral system.
 
Soon after his mother had been required to leave, Mr Ogbe-Millar left the Emergency Department unaccompanied saying he was  going outside  to  smoke a cigarette.

A Mental Health Act assessment carried out at the Magistrates Court on 24 September 2019 decided that he should be detained under Section 2 of the Mental Health Act. However, as there were no hospital beds available at the time that Mr Popalzai’s case was heard, he was remanded in custody to HMP Pentonville. Mr Popalzai was transferred to the inpatient wing at HMP Pentonville on 29 September 2019.
There were significant barriers to communicating with Mr Popalzai as he spoke predominantly in Pashto. Throughout his time in the inpatient unit, Mr Popalzai was acutely psychotic. He was aggressive and most interactions with psychiatrists, healthcare staff and prison officers took place through the cell door. Mr Popalzai consistently refused to take any medication as he did not accept that he was mentally ill. Mr Popalzai stated on several occasions that he would hang himself if transferred to a psychiatric hospital. On 9 October 2019, Mr Popalzai was assessed by a psychiatrist who found that he was psychotic and needed to be transferred to hospital for treatment under section 48 Mental Health Act 1983. The Crystal Ward, which is the psychiatric intensive care unit at the Newham Centre for Mental Health, was identified as the appropriate unit. A second assessment was carried out by a psychiatrist from the Crystal Ward on 18 October. The 2nd psychiatrist agreed that Mr Popalzai should be detained on the Crystal Ward for assessment and treatment under section 48 Mental Health Act on 24 October 2019. However, there were no beds available on Crystal Ward at that time. On 21 November 2019, the Crystal Ward advised that a bed issued by the Ministry of Justice and arrangements were made for Mr Popalzai to be transferred to the Crystal Ward on the afternoon of 29 November 2019. At around 12.30 pm on 29 November 2019, Mr Popalzai was found hanging in his cell. Attempts were made to resuscitate Mr Popalzai but his death was confirmed by paramedics at the scene. The psychiatric evidence was consistent that: 1) the only effective treatment for Mr Popalzai’s psychosis was anti- psychotic medication; 2) anti-psychotic medication could not be given to him against his wishes in a prison setting. As a result, he needed to be transferred to an appropriate psychiatric unit. 3) Mr Popalzai’s mental health deteriorated in the time that he was waiting for a psychiatric bed to become available. I also heard evidence that a significant number of prisoners from HMP Pentonville were transferred to psychiatric units under the Mental Health Act each year. I was told that the experience of psychiatrists at the prison was that the target time of 14 days from 1st assessment to transfer set out in the statutory guidance was seldom met. I was also told that significant delays in beds becoming available were extremely common and delays of up to 6 months were not unheard of.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. 
1) Prisoners who are acutely psychotic and refusing treatment that requires transfer to hospital under the Mental Health Act are being left untreated and at risk of further deterioration due to a shortage of suitable psychiatric hospital bed spaces becoming available in a timely way.","On 4 December 2019, I commenced an investigation into the death of Abdullah Popalzai (20 years).

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows:
It is not mandatory for prison officers to have basic first aid training (which includes the provision of CPR) which is in-date. Once a prison officer’s three-year period has expired, whilst they may be reminded by the prison establishment that their certification is no longer live, it is not mandatory for them to renew this. For example, at HMP Manchester, at present 52% of prison staff received Emergency First Aid at Work (EFAW) training within the past three years as part of their initial officer training. Therefore, 48% of prison staff will have training certification (which includes CPR) which has expired. The evidence admitted was that the main reason for this is due to it not being mandatory for prison staff to have up-to-date training.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Monday 1st April 2024.

On 11th December 2022, Mrs Bracegirdle was hot to the touch when seen by the district nurses. A remote GP review prescribed a cream. No observations were taken.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The inquest heard evidence that because Mrs Bracegirdle was in a care home setting the District Nurses were responsible for management of her pressure ulcers. The care home was asked to ensure pressure relieving processes were followed. However, the District Nurses did not share care plans with the care team on the basis that they were digital documents and were care plans for the use of District Nurses. As a consequence, the care home management were not fully sighted, and joint care was more difficult to deliver increasing the risk of the pressure ulcers deteriorating.
 
There was no communication strategy in place as a consequence of an approach that did not promote team /joint working. The inquest heard that as a consequence the family were unsighted on the condition of Mrs Bracegirdle until shortly before her admission to hospital. This meant that the family could not support the work to reduce the risk of the pressure ulcers deteriorating further and were not able to be a proactive about the care she was receiving increasing the risk of her pressure ulcers deteriorating",On 10th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Susan Wendy BRACEGIRDLE.

He had been driving his new electric moped at about 1.30 am on the 1st June 2023 when he collided with street furniture and sustained catastrophic unsurvivable injuries. He had no prior experience of riding the moped. A nearby resident heard the collision and went to his aid and called emergency services. The call recording illustrates the first-aider’s increasing concern as Lucas deteriorated. Lucas can be heard in the background very clearly to be deteriorating rapidly and significantly. A Category 1 (C1) ambulance was dispatched followed by another as there were two casualties. C1 reflects an emergency response travelling with blue lights and sirens. The EEAST uses a computer aided dispatch (CAD) system which also automatically dispatched a solo paramedic in a rapid response vehicle (RRV). Fire co-responders were also deployed. A General Broadcast (GB) was not made. A GB is an alert to any other nearby resources who might possibly assist. EEAST policy requires a GB where there are no nearby resources. The first ambulance sent was based at the Luton ambulance station meaning it was greater than 20 minutes away. The second ambulance was also greater than 20 minutes away. The target response time for a C1 ambulance is an average of 7 minutes and 15 minutes for 90% of calls. It was known at the time of dispatch that it would greatly exceed the target time. A Critical Care Dispatcher was aware of the call and nature and considered deploying a Critical Care Team (CCT) but opted to let the crew from the first ambulance to assess and report. This was despite the crew being at least 20 minutes away. The nearest CCT was 42 minutes away by air. It was night which presents difficulties in safe landing etc. It was accepted on reflection that the CCT should have been sent. The RRV was 3 minutes from the scene. The proximity of the RRV was not revealed in the EEAS Serious Incident Investigation Report but emerged during questioning. The RRV was dispatched by the CAD but then immediately cancelled by a dispatcher due to the Trust’s End of Shift Policy seemingly without regard to the actuality of the situation, that the two dispatched ambulances were more than 20 minutes away, a CCT was not dispatched and that a RRV 3 minutes away could have rendered essential aid. The End of Shift Policy limits the calls crews can be dispatched to within the last one hour and last 30 minutes of their shift. The coding allocated to Lucas did not permit the RRV to be sent. As mentioned above, there was clear evidence through the call of Lucas’s markedly deteriorating condition. There appears to have been no coding reassessment. The Critical Care Dispatcher and the “routine” dispatcher were not in the same location but could see each other’s entries into the computer system in real time as they were made. There was no direct dialogue between them. There was no evidence of a dynamic overview reassessment of the situation as it progressed. Had there been, it is possible, likely even, that the RRV would have been deployed. Medical evidence was clear Lucas would not have survived but that was not known at the time of the call.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

He developed an infection at the suture site. He was prescribed antibiotics by his GP. On 25 February he attended the Emergency Department at Calderdale Royal Hospital. This was an opportunity to discuss his case with a vascular consultant. It did not happen. On 26 February paramedics attended Peter at home at 10.42. There was evidence available of a herald bleed indicating that a major haemorrhage was likely to happen. This was not appreciated at the time and an opportunity was missed to admit Peter to the specialist Vascular Unit at the Bradford Royal Infirmary where, on the balance of probability, a procedure necessary to save his life could have been undertaken. In fact Peter was admitted to Calderdale Royal Hospital Emergency Department following a second attendance on his at home at 20.32 on 26 February. The concern at that stage was in relation sepsis, not the risk of haemorrhage. He was triaged to level 3. At 22.56 a nurse noted bleeding at the suture site.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1. The inquest heard evidence that a shortage of mental health beds nationally meant that the situation that arose here of a placement out of area many miles from home was not unusual and that private beds were being used on a regular basis due to a shortage of NHS beds. The inquest heard that this meant that there were a number of consequences as a result all of such placements which could as in Ms Khan’s case impact on a patient and increase the risk they presented. In particular:","On 15th February 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Shahzadi Khan. The investigation concluded on the 23rd November 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative:

This impacted on his day-to-day health and well being. He had a complex past medical history to include depression, [REDACTED] addiction and chronic multi system, medically unexplained symptoms of unclear cause. There had not been a formal diagnosis of Mast Cell Activation Syndrome as there
was minimal evidence to reach this but he was under specialist care provided by the Clinical Immunology Department at Derriford Hospital who were providing valuable advice and guidance to manage his symptoms. Guy had previously disclosed to his sister, GP and Mental Health Services that he had researched ways to end his life and at one stage stated he had a plan in place but that he did not intend to act on those plans. He had some contact with mental health services and engaged in 3 intervention sessions with Wellbeing Coaches in October 2022 following which he reported feeling better. His final contact with the Mental Health Connect team was on 15th May 2023 when he reported ongoing chronic suicidal ideation. He agreed to contact with his GP and a safety plan was discussed. A review was held with his GP on 31st May 2023 at which time his physical and mental health was discussed at length. There was no change in his chronic suicidal thoughts, and he was keen to explore treatment and support for his condition. He declined any referral for further mental health or psychology services at that time.
 
Guy contacted his sister on the telephone in the early hours of 1st July 2023 and his opening comment was that he loved her. She stated that she would call him later. On attempting to contact him later that morning she was unable to get a response and raised a concern for welfare. Police officers attended his home address and he was found deceased in the bath. His death was confirmed at 15:24 on 1 July 2023. His death was due to Asphyxiation.
 
Police Officers at the scene located a printed 60-page document at his home address titled “[REDACTED]” which had been printed from a website [REDACTED].

The MATTERS OF CONCERN fall into two broad areas:
COVID-19 related concerns
 
i)The government took the decision to offer furlough to those in receipt of PAYE as at the end of February 2020. Most of the c1600 lifeguards who work on the 250 beaches where the RNLI are present are seasonal employees. They did not qualify for furlough. At that point in time, the RNLI was in the process or recruiting and training the seasonal lifeguards it required. When furlough was not offered, a number had to seek alternative means of income. As lockdown was eased and lifeguards were required, the RNLI did not have immediately available to it the seasonal employees it required to provide beach safety around the coast.","On 31/1/24, I concluded the inquests into the deaths of: Michael Pender, who drowned at Treyarnon beach on 25/5/20;Jan Klempar, who drowned at Porthcurno beach on 25/6/20;Paul Mullen, who drowned at Church Cove on the Lizard on 20/8/20.   ",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 30 March 2024.

In 2022, his condition deteriorated. His GP referred him twice to the Community Mental Health Team but the referrals were rejected with medication being prescribed instead, together with advice to contact Talking Therapies.   ","During the course of these inquests, the evidence has revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
 
The Trust’s Patient Safety Review identified the following concerns:
 
When Mr Gerasimidis was referred by his GP to the community mental health team, he was screened out, in part, due to challenging staffing issues;
No care coordinator was appointed owing to a shortage of staff;
The Trust had and continues to have vacancies at consultant level;
The family was wrongly advised the Trust was not commissioned to treat OCD;
The family was not informed of a nearest relative’s right under the Mental Health Act to request a case review by an AMHP;
Psychological treatment in the form of Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with Exposure Response Prevention had a waiting list of one year;
In May 2023, when it was felt Mr Gerasimidis required an informal admission into hospital, no beds were available.
 
The difficulties with staff recruitment and bed availability are long term problems in the Cornwall coroner area. The Patient Safety Review suggests Cornwall has fewer beds for its population than other areas. It is the persistent or recurring nature of these concerns that leads me to believe action should be taken.","On 3/6/23, I concluded the inquest into the death of Nicolas Gerasimidis.

His appetite reduced, he had increasing lethargy and developed tremors. He began to lose weight. No investigations were carried out until he was referred to gastroenterology on the cancer pathway. He was very frail by the time of the referral. The tests indicated his oesophagus was not functioning effectively but there was no clear cause. He was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital on 15th March 2023 after the GP examined him and was concerned about how frail he was. On admission no clear reversible cause was identified. He was put on Nil by Mouth due to his poor oesophageal functionality. He presented a high risk of aspiration. On the balance of probabilities, the deterioration in his oesophageal function was due to an undiagnosed neurological condition. On 17th March he suffered an acute respiratory event due to aspirating on his saliva.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
The inquest heard evidence that symptoms raised by Mr Briney and his family were attributed to old age rather than a possible neurological disease. The evidence before the inquest was that there were situations where clinicians would attribute a deterioration to the aging process rather than consider the whole picture and investigate if there was a treatable condition. This presented a risk that treatable conditions in the elderly could be missed.",On 21st March 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of Terence Briney.

In 2010 he was confirmed to have an allergy to nuts and in particular peanuts.
 
He was prescribed an Epi-pen and antihistamines to manage his allergy. His Epi-pen was renewed only on his request, James last requested his Epi-pen in 2015. He attended 3 asthma reviews prior to his death. His allergy was not addressed during the reviews. There was no regular allergy review procedure provided locally or nationally.
 
On 10 July 2020 he ordered food for himself and flatmates from Dadyal Takeaway Restaurant. Their menu contained limited information as to the ingredients used in the dishes produced and no allergen information or allergen matrix. James ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala pizza. The presence of peanuts in both the dishes produced and in use in the kitchen was not referred to in the menu. James knew about his nut/peanut allergy. He did not contact Dadyal to advise of his allergy and was unaware that the Chicken Tikka Masala pizza ordered contained mixed nut powder comprising of up to 99 per cent peanuts. He suffered an allergic reaction shortly after consuming the pizza. He called an ambulance which arrived within four minutes of his call. His Epi-pen could not be located; missing an opportunity for an adrenaline injection prior to Paramedic arrival.

The report of [REDACTED] (attached) identifies the need for wider consideration of a systematic approach to improving anaphylaxis awareness and management.

(brief summary of matters of concern)
 
There is no requirement for a risk assessment to be carried out before a patient is placed in a side room (other than for risk of falls), so as to identify if they will have any risks and difficulties associated with communicating their needs to staff in an emergency situation.

Christopher Kapessa, aged 13, attended the Red Bridge at Abercwmboi in the afternoon of 1st July 2019, meeting a group of school friends of largely the same age, some of whom intended to jump into the water. Christopher took with him clothes in which he could swim, undressed to his shorts and approached the water side. He had not decided whether to enter the water and was expressing both a desire to swim and concern due to his limited ability to swim. At about 17.25, while he was standing by the water side looking in to the river, he was deliberately pushed in to the water by another child, falling 2.5 metres to the water surface.  There was a current.  The water was cold and too deep for him to touch the bottom and keep his head above the surface. Christopher was swiftly in difficulty, thrashing ineffectively with his arms.  Children, including the boy who had pushed him, jumped in to the water to try to save him, but were unable to do so. He became submerged. Some of the children sought help and the emergency services attended and carried out a search, finding Christopher underwater at about 19.25. Resuscitation attempts took place but after so long a period submerged, Christopher could not be saved.
 
The narrative conclusion which I returned was:
 
Christopher Kapessa, aged 13, died by submersion when intentionally pushed by another child into the river Cynon. The push was a dangerous prank. However, the child responsible for it did not intend to cause Christopher’s death and himself jumped into the water with other children in an unsuccessful attempt at rescue.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The Court found that the site was known by children as a site from which to swim, but that this was unknown to the Coal Authority. Nevertheless, Coal Authority documentation was not easily cross referenced or accessible to inspectors to ensure that any reports that might be made with respect to activities by members of the public who might put themselves at risk were available to inspectors when conducting safety inspections.",A Coronial investigation was commenced on 8th July 2019 into the death of Christopher Grace Kapessa.

It would seem that staff speaking with [REDACTED]  on these occasions failed to think laterally or innovatively as to how to collect important, relevant collateral history whilst still respecting Ms. Woodman’s wish that her condition not be discussed with                                       .
 
The ability of mental health clinicians to gain a complete picture of Ms. Woodman’s medical history was hampered by the fact that the information management systems holding these records at her GP practice was not accessible to secondary mental health services.

On the 2nd January 2023 he was cycling his bicycle with a friend, a common activity for Mr Colledge. He was riding along Island Lane, Winmarleigh when his bicycle entered a crack defect in the carriageway causing him to be thrown from his bicycle and sustain injuries which caused his death. The crack defect in question had been seen by local residents and members of the local Parish Council on the 9th September 2022. They took photographs of the defect and others on the road, and reported them to the Highways department at the Lancashire County Council. The senior manager who received the photographs tasked others to inspect the road and repair the defects. Four Highways operatives attended the road in two vehicles on the 15th of September 2022. The road was driven in its entirety and no defects were noticed or repaired. A second, scheduled inspection took place by Highways inspectors on the 26th of September 2022. This also involved two operatives conducting a driven inspection and neither observed the crack defect which caused Mr Colledge’s collision. Consequently the crack was not repaired and remained hazardous in the roadway at the time of Mr Colledge’s incident and death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
Highway operatives gave evidence that their inspections primarily consider the impact of defects upon cars using that road surface. All gave evidence of no specific training or experience with regards to identifying defects which present a hazard to bicycle users, when expert evidence indicated that the Council’s statutory duty required reasonable steps to protect all road users which includes cyclists. The evidence of Council witnesses was unanimous that since Mr Colledge’s death, there has been no additional training, updates, briefings or policy reviews to offer further knowledge of operatives in safely assessing defects which pose risks to cyclists or road users other than car drivers. I consider there is a risk of future deaths of all cyclists if Highways Operatives and inspectors are not able to identify defects on a carriageway which present a risk to cyclists as opposed to simply car users.
 
Evidence from a Highways Expert, [REDACTED] , explained that Island Lane is part of peat/moss road which is the subject of natural movement when it rains. The water is absorbed by the peat/moss and swells caused the tarmac to move then it compacts when it dries and the road surface lowers, causing cracks.[REDACTED]’ evidence was that there is natural movement but
these defects rarely get better, only worse. I am concerned that the road surfacing on Island Lane, Winmarleigh will continue to be the subject of natural movement and the present surfacing is hampered by the geography of the location including camber of the road. I consider there is a risk of future deaths to road users if the surfacing of this road is not adequately maintained. Whilst the inspection schedule timescales enacted by the Council are considered to be appropriate, I consider there is a risk of future deaths due to the present surfacing and underlying geological features of this road if inspections are unable to reasonably identify hazardous defects.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 12th January 2024. I, the Coroner, may extend the period and to take into account the likely disruption to services caused by Christmas breaks, I extend that period of response to the 26th January 2024.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
 
There were significant assumptions made about the whereabouts of Lee and the reasons for his failure to contact family. The assumptions were based on the facts of Lee’s addiction which on one view ought to have been identified as a vulnerability, on another view were wholly irrelevant in the context of his family confirming he was in daily contact until 31 October 2021.
Insufficient weight was placed on the information provided by Lee’s family about his current state of mind and ordinary behaviours. Although there was a THRIVE assessment undertaken by the call handler on 2 November 2021 when the first missing person report was made, the burden of the weight fell on his PNC record and police intelligence information painting a picture which was not representative of the concerns of his family.",On 12th January 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lee Bowman born on 10th January 1977.

The MATTER THAT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT is the method of prescribing medications such as Zopiclone [REDACTED] etc. to patients with a history which suggests that they either are or are very likely to be becoming dependent upon such medications or are misusing them.
Examples of both the above would be too frequent requests for repeat prescriptions and information concerning and a history of overdoses.
 
The Inquest discussed whether circumstances, including those outlined above should trigger an automatic/mandatory medication review conducted  with the patient; consideration of a different prescribing period and very careful monitoring of the online requests for repeat prescriptions.
Alternatively, there could be a ban on the requests for repeat prescriptions with the repeats simply being issued for an appropriate period of time “automatically”.
 
In this case as you will see from [REDACTED] report, over twice the appropriate amount of Zopiclone was issued over a period of 57 days.
 
The patient in question had Zopiclone present at a fatal level in his blood at the time of his collapse from which he never recovered.
 
I remain very worried about these prescribing issues and about the fact that apparently receptionists and clinicians can override the warnings in the surgery’s computer system. I should like this to be carefully investigated and look forward to hearing with a response within the relevant time period.
 
I realise that the situation may be exacerbated by GPs working part time and many part time practitioners being involved in the prescribing procedure as well as many receptionists being involved in it but if this is the trend then it seems to me the safeguards must be extended not made easier to override.
 
The other ‘failsafe device’ is the dispensing pharmacist.
When repeats are requested online there is a designated pharmacy. They receive emailed scripts. Their own systems should flag up cases of over or too frequent prescribing as well as other matters.",On 18 th April 2018 I commenced an investigation into the death of Darren James CARRINGTON The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6th June 2018.,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you AND your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 4th 2018.
