10/11/2022,2022-0417,Michael Smith,Crispin Oliver,County Durham and Darlington,Suicide (from 2015) | State Custody related deaths,HM Prison and Probation Service,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/michael-smith-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Michael-Smith-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2022-0417_Published.pdf,"Michael entered HMP Durham on 10 July 2020. Body scan revealed he was plugged with packages. He was transferred to SACU. There was control and restraint incidents on the way an on arrival, where he was strip searched. He was placed and remained on 3 man unlock for his entire time there. At 17.45 on 11 July he was discovered self-suspended. Paramedics achieved the return of spontaneous circulation, but he died at University Hospital North Durham on 13 July 2020.  

The medical cause of death was:
1) a) Hypoxic brain injury
b) Cardiorespiratory arrest
c) Hanging

Toxicology on hospital admission bloods showed toxic levels","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Between his arrival in SACU at 18.37 on 10 July 2020 and his being discovered self suspended with a ligature at 17.45 on 11 July 2020 there, Michael was subject to a 3 man unlock.
On the morning of 11 July, a Saturday, there were 3 officers on duty on SACU. This did permit his cell to be unlocked for a meal to be delivered and for a cursory one and a half minute conversation with a nurse that fell short, on her evidence, of an actual medical examination.

On the afternoon of 11 July there were only one or (briefly) two officers on SACU duty per the staff duty log, albeit, as CCTV footage shows, more officers did attend intermittently for specific tasks. The SACU staff duty log shows only one officer on duty for the whole afternoon to 17.00. In any event medical assessments of Michael were not undertaken at any stage while he was on SACU, the reason being given that he was on three man unlock. It appears that there were never sufficient staff available for a dedicated medical assessment to be undertaken. This notwithstanding that evidence from prison officers and a nurse was that during the course of the afternoon Michale`s presentation had become ""angrier"" and ""bizarre"". In fact, it is now known, he had been ingesting toxic amounts, an unlicensed drug, he had secreted into the prison (his being detected at reception as plugged led him to SACU). is a highly potent which effects judgement and lowers inhibitions. The jury subsequently concluded that the absence of medical, and mental health, assessments, and the use of the (which was never diagnosed), contributed to the Michael`s death.

From 17.00, when patrol state commenced, there was clearly only one officer on duty and present. When she discovered Michael self suspended that officer made a perfectly defensible dynamic assessment, electing not to enter the cell unsupported. She made ready to enter for when back up arrived. In the event, partly because there was another discipline incident unfolding on a different wing, this took 2-3 minutes. There were only 16 prison officers available while on patrol state across the entire prison, and they were already at full stretch, and probably beyond it (the Tactical Resources Unit from Doncaster were en route).

The evidence was that without knowing precisely when Michael self-suspended any such delay could not be held, on a balance of probabilities, to have entered the chain of causation death. However, the fact remains that there was a delay consequent to Michael being on a three man unlock but there being only a single officer available on SACU while in patrol state. It is reasonable to conjecture that this could have made the difference between life and death in this case, and the repetition of these circumstances could well do so in future.
In your response dated 15 November 2021 to the Regulation 28 report of HM Assistant Coroner James Thompson of 21 September 2021 following the Inquest into the death of Charlie Brian Todd at HMP Durham, you wrote, amongst other things:

""There is clear management oversight of the SACU"".

This is not what the evidence in the instance case showed. Rather, what it made clear was that:

1) the SACU staff log plus CCTV further demonstrated that HMAC Thompson`s point to you that ""officers, including officers not posted to SACU, but covering for a shift, were required to allocate various task between themselves on an ad-hoc basis"" was an ongoing problem, and this appears to be still ongoing;
2) NOMIS record keeping was unhelpfully sparse (""you would expect more"" was the evidence of SACU manager);
3) the daily log was under-utilised as a multi-disciplinary tool, and this appears to be ongoing.

You also stated:

""I am confident that the staffing levels and supervisory arrangements in place are sufficient to deliver all of the SACU`s regime"".

This, too, is clearly not the case. Staffing levels remain the same. Safeguarding of prisoners is compromised as a consequence. With a three man unlock imposed, there should be three officers available at all times to ensure safety. Staffing levels at HMP Durham should be increased.","On 23 July 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Raymond SMITH aged 31. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 09 November 2022. 
The conclusion of the inquest was:  
Misadventure.  

And the jury added this narrative to that conclusion:  
The fact that the scanner revealed he was plugged with drugs;
The manner in which control and restraints, and the strip search were conducted, and a failure to de-escalate;
The absence of any mental health assessment during Michael's arrival in reception and being discovered suspended in his cell;
The absence of a medical assessment during Michael's arrival in reception and being discovered in reception; and 
Michael's use of drugs, during his time on SACU  

The above were all contributions that were more than minimal, negligible or trivial and probably contributed to Michael's death. Each presented and opportunity to do something, or not do something, that would have probably prevented Michael's death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by January 05, 2023.

20/06/2023,2023-0201,Anita Graves,Adrian Farrow,Manchester South,"Alcohol, drugs medication related deaths",Medicines &amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/anita-graves-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Anita-Graves-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0201_Published.pdf,"Mrs Graves was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism in 2019. Her condition was monitored by specialists from the Endocrinology Team at the local hospital and regulated by carbimazole and propranolol. The regular dose of carbimazole in particular, was adjusted periodically by Mrs Graves' GP in light of regular reviews of blood test results under the supervision and guidance of the Endocrinology Team. 

An unusually abnormal blood test result in early December 2022 revealed that Mrs Graves' thyroid had rapidly and unexpected become underactive. The clinical decision was taken to discontinue temporarily the carbimazole and propranolol medication pending analysis of repeat blood tests which were scheduled for early January 2023. By 22nd December 2022, Mrs Graves' thyroid had become overactive again and resulted in an emergency admission to hospital for treatment. Carbimazole and propranolol were re-started and by 30th December 2022, the FT4 had dropped from 116.6 to 64.8, reflecting a significant improvement in thyroid hormones.

Mrs Graves remained in hospital, suffering a persistently high heart rate during her admission and developed an E.Coli urinary tract infection, which did not respond to treatment and brought about her death on 4th January 2023. 

The evidence at the inquest revealed that carbimazole is dispensed in 5mg, 10mg and 20mg tablet forms, which are visually virtually impossible to distinguish from each other. The adjusted doses periodically required different daily combinations of these tablets to achieve the correct prescribed dose. Compounding the potential confusion of differing strengths of tablets was their visual similarity to aspirin, which was also part of Mrs Graves regular prescription and the variety of packaging (unmarked pharmacy boxes and different manufacturer's packaging, for example) in which the carbimazole tablets were dispensed by the community pharmacy. 

The inquest found that Mrs Graves had inadvertently taken more than the prescribed dose of carbimazole which had caused the sudden underactive thyroid in early December 2022. 

The ongoing potential confusion of the differing strengths of carbimazole tablets was highlighted by both the specialist Endocrinology Team pharmacist and consultant during the evidence notwithstanding that this issue had been recognised and the subject of national guidance historically.

Whilst Mrs Graves' hyperthyroidism was not the direct cause of her death, it was a significant contributory condition and the inadvertent increased dose of carbimazole had been the precipitating factor in her hospitalisation and was the background to her inability to fight the infection from which she died.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) That the visual similarity of tablets of differing strengths of carbimazole to each other and to aspirin presents a risk of inadvertent overdose; and
That the dispensing process in the community for carbimazole appears to contribute to rather than mitigating the risk","On 27th January 2023, an investigation was commenced into the death of Anita Graves, aged 92 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 30th May 2023. The outcome of the inquest was that the medical cause of the death of Mrs Graves was: 1a. Urinary Tract Infection 1b. E.Coli 2 Hyperthyroidism  

The conclusion was that she died from E.Coli infection following treatment for hyperthyroidism.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 15th August 2023.

He took lithium medication. He deteriorated at his home address and was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital after concerns were raised by his family. He was found to have pneumonia and lithium toxicity, a complication of his bronchopneumonia and related to his dehydration. He deteriorated despite treatment and died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 17th December 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The evidence before the inquest was that Mr Sullivan was a vulnerable person with a complex mental health history. The inquest heard evidence that GPs could access a Crisis Review Team to assess patients such as Mr Sullivan. However, the evidence before the inquest was that there seemed to be delays between referrals and assessments. It was unclear if these were due to a lack of understanding by GPs on how the CRT could be used or how patients were prioritised within the CRT or a lack of effective triage by GPs before referral or the CRT following referral.
In his case the concern was raised by his family on 13th December 2022 with the GP. The GP referred him to the CRT that day indicating he needed an assessment on 14th December 2023 for confusion following a fall and a possible UTI. At the assessment on 14th December 2023 at 11am Mr Sullivan was seriously unwell.","On 22nd December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Brian Sullivan.

In the period that followed there were two serious attempts at overdose both of which resulted in lengthy admissions into ICU. He was admitted to Longreach and was known to the in-patient team.  

On 6//1/23, he was admitted into RCHT following an overdose. He was then transferred to Longreach and admitted on to Perran Ward on 22/1/23 before being transferred to Carbis and Cove wards on 25/1/23 and 6/2/23 respectively.  

He was admitted as an informal patient and, prior to his transfer to Cove ward, had a number of episodes of escorted leave.  

On 8/2/23, the inquest heard that Cove ward was understaffed with only one of three rostered nurses due to attend. Accordingly, the ward manager, [REDACTED], came to work early to assist her nursing colleagues. While treating another patient with suspected sepsis, Chris requested leave to go into the hospital's grounds. [REDACTED] accepted in evidence she had not had time to read Chris's RiO records and she did not then appreciate that his previous leave had only been escorted. She delegated to an HCA, in effect, to check that leave was appropriate before authorising it without conducting her own assessment of risk.

There was a short delay in appreciating that Chris had not returned to the ward as anticipated. His body was discovered three days later.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The Trust has conducted a PSIR the contents of which were reviewed at inquest. The report reached conclusions I found entirely reasonable. I also heard from[REDACTED] about the steps that are being taken to implement the changes felt to be appropriate. This includes a change to the consultant model with one consultant now responsible for the individual wards. There is also an initiative to standardise documentation, for example, at handover, and later MDT (when risks are reviewed), to ensure this is incorporated into RiO, together with an express intention to involve the family in decision-making. It was accepted that risk should be assessed by a nurse prior to granting leave to an informal patient particularly where unescorted leave is being considered for the first time.

Although Chris's death occurred in February 2022, it also became clear that the process had not been completed. It was hoped this could be achieved by the end of July this year but the inquest was told there would need to be consideration of the proposals by the different consultants now involved. I was concerned to ensure that the process was completed without undue delay and it is with this in mind that I now write to you.","On 21/6/23, I concluded an inquest into the death of Christopher Stevens, aged 58, who was found deceased on 11/2/22.

Whilst the time it took for the ambulance to arrive to Mr Harmsworth's home and the time it took for Mr Harmsworth to be handed over to nursing staff at hospital did not cause or contribute to Mr Harmsworth's death, the delays experienced are significant. It is understood that the matter of ambulance delays is not solely a matter for WAST hence this report being sent to those organisations involved in its impact across the Health Board area (to include the provision of social care where patients are medical fit for discharge from hospitals but without adequate placements / care in the community).

I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to BCUHB and WAST pertaining to the length of time it is taking for ambulances to arrive to patients and handover at hospitals.

I remain significantly concerned that delays are continuing and that deaths will continue to occur into the future.",On 29 June 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Leonard Charles Harmsworth (DOB 29/3/33) who died on 18 June 2022.

She was 24 at the time of her death. Her death in hospital on 23 February 2022 happened after she jumped [REDACTED] on 16 February 2022.  

The key facts for the purposes of this report are as follows:  
Lucy had mild learning disabilities but had capacity to make her own decisions and go out alone. She needed support with everyday tasks and remembering to do things.Lucy lived in supported accommodation in Reading, funded by Wokingham Borough Council. A support worker was provided by a care provider (Dimensions).  

Mental Health Support:  
Lucy had some interactions with mental health services over the years, and we focused on her most recent contacts. Lucy was under the care of the Crisis Home Resolution and Treatment Team (CRHTT, hereafter referred to as 'the crisis team') between 11th January and 2nd February 2022, after an overdose. She was discharged from mental health services with a recommendation to refer herself to a group called SUN (Service Users Network). She had been told at that point that she did not meet the criteria for the learning disabilities team and was advised to speak to her GP herself from that point.She saw a mental health practitioner based at her GP surgery on 15thFebruary, indicating that she had thoughts of jumping from a particular bridge in Reading. The crisis team was contacted. Their advice was that, Lucy had been discharged recently from the service, and that she did not meet the criteria for being taken on by them. The recommendation for Lucy to refer herself to the SUN group remained. They did not speak to Lucy at that point. They did not offer her support from other mental health teams.

Safeguarding referrals
· There was at least one earlier safeguarding referral, but we focused on those in the last 12 months of Lucy's life.

·A safeguarding referral was sent to Reading Borough Council in May 2021 following an incident where Lucy took too many sleeping tablets. This report referenced Lucy's past history of deliberate self-harm. The evidence suggests that this was not reviewed by Reading Borough Council for almost 3 months - in August 2021 - when it was deemed to be an inappropriate referral on the basis that it did not describe abuse or neglect.

·Between 10th and 20th January 2022, 3 separate safeguarding concerns were raised with Reading Borough Council. These are referred to below.

·On the 10th January 2022, a safeguarding referral was made regarding an overdose of Nurofen tablets.

·On the 18th January, there was an update on the above referral, but this related to additional incidents, including ingestion of bleach. When this was followed up by telephone (with the person who had made the referral) RBC's record of this conversation includes the following:
Lucy has allegedly done a few more self-harm attempts…she is making several threats of suicide ([REDACTED]). Today she tried to[REDACTED] … her mental health seems to be deteriorating…Dimensions believe she needs more support than what they can provide as they are not mental health skilled professionals.

·Subsequent to the referrals on 10th and 18th January, a social worker recorded that she did not think that Section 42 [of the Care Act] criteria were met. She also concluded that there was ""robust support from agencies involved and appropriate measures have been taken to address risks posed by her threats of self-harm. No serious harm has occurred to Miss Walles"".

· On 20th January, South Central Ambulance Service Centre made a safeguarding referral. This referral relates to a previous overdose, and mental health deterioration. The report said that Lucy had told them she did not want to be here anymore.

·During all of these safeguarding referrals, Lucy was not contacted at all. It appears that the only information taken into account in reaching conclusions was the initial safeguarding report itself and information on Reading Borough Council's computer system (Mosaic). These would have included earlier safeguarding reports.

After the third safeguarding concern was raised by the ambulance service, no review or action took place before the tragic events of 16th February 2022.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

The concerns arising out of this investigation and inquest relate to the following key areas,
a) Safeguarding
b) Mental health provision
c) Inter-agency communication - particularly where there is some doubt over who should provide additional support needed by a person.

We heard in evidence that in the months after Lucy's death, a Safeguarding Adults Board considered the case, but did not consider that a Safeguarding Adults Review ('SAR') should be undertaken. Evidence from Wokingham Borough Council was that they were not at that time aware of the number of safeguarding referrals that had been made.

A decision was made (some six days before the inquest) that a SAR will now be conducted. The evidence of the Assistant Director of Adult Social Care was that this is likely to be completed within 1-3 months after the inquest.

I have set out the issues / concerns that I have for each of the two recipients of this report, below.

Reading Borough Council
1) Time scales for review and triage of safeguarding referrals.
2) Requirements to speak to the individual about whom safeguarding concerns have been raised.
3) Training around Section 42 and when a report meets the threshold for neglect or abuse. This training should also consider what options are available if a concern does not meet the threshold for a Section 42 enquiry.
4) Systems for making other involved agencies aware of safeguarding referrals and concerns.
5) In relation to each of the above points, whether RBC should reflect the above changes in formal (written) policy, as well as delivering training.
6) Improving interaction amongst agencies involved, and consideration of the threshold for arranging joint meetings to discuss service users, whether they meet Section 42 thresholds or not. The evidence we heard is that this is now being actively encouraged. Should there be written guidance about this somewhat subjective issue ?
7) Whether they consider that the resourcing of this service is adequate and safe.
8) Systems for auditing, and what will happen if the auditing reveals ongoing issues.

Berkshire Health Care
1) How do the changes/proposed changes to systems (including the 'One Team' approach) make a difference? Specifically:
a) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would not be discharged from the crisis team without additional support, as she was on 2nd February?
b) Is the trust able to say with any confidence that a patient like Lucy would be offered some support, whether by the crisis team or otherwise, in the situation that arose on the 15th February?

2) Do they consider that resourcing of these services is adequate and safe?","I conducted an inquest into the death of Lucy Anne Walles, which concluded on 16th June 2023. I recorded a conclusion of suicide. 

I concluded that her cause of death was :

Her father had called the crisis line in desperation the day before. His call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved. It is unclear whether any alternative action by the crisis team would have changed the outcome.,"During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. I was shocked when I listened to the recording of the call that [REDACTED] made to the crisis line the day before his daughter died.

The East London NHS Foundation Trust (ELFT) serious incident (SI) report observed that the clinician did not elicit clear risks during the conversation; did not listen to[REDACTED] ; talked over him; did not appear empathic; and dismissed his distress about his daughter, even though she was a patient known to services after a first episode of psychosis.

In reaching my conclusion at inquest that the call was not treated with the seriousness it deserved, I agreed with all of those observations.[REDACTED] was not taken seriously, he was not treated respectfully and he was not treated kindly. He was clearly desperate about his daughter's mental health and, as we now know, he was right to be desperate. He rang the crisis line and he was belittled.

The clinician then made no note of the call in the medical records, even retrospectively.

I note the many recommendations of the thoughtful SI report, but I remain concerned on three counts.

·This is not the first time that I have made a PFD report to ELFT about its crisis line.

·Not only did the clinician in question not make a note of the call in the medical record, he told me in court that, after Freeda Glausiusz's death his manager had told him not to make an appropriately dated retrospective note in the record. He said that he had made a note on a piece of paper, but he did not now have that piece of paper.

When I asked the lead SI reviewer if the trust is confident that it has taken all appropriate actions in respect of that clinician, she was not able to give me that assurance.

2. I heard at inquest that the clinician and his manager had listened to the recording of the call within days of the death and had recognised very significant shortcomings. However, the recording was not then volunteered to my coroner's officer. I was aware of the existence of the call only because[REDACTED] told my officer about it.

·I received a copy of the recording of the call (without a transcript) the day before the inquest.

·I received a statement from the clinician who took the call the day before the inquest.

·I received statements from other ELFT clinicians in dribs and drabs earlier this month.

·I received a copy of the SI report the day before the inquest.

·I never received a copy of the 48 hour hot de-brief.

·Freeda Glausiusz died five months ago. My officer first requested witness statements and a copy of any internal investigation on 7 June, over four months ago, and asked for the statements to be provided by 20 August.

This chronology does not demonstrate an eagerness to promote a learning culture by ELFT. The failure to provide prompt and candid co-operation with my office obstructs the coronial inquiry, an inquiry that includes the function of learning from deaths. And it does not demonstrate respect for the family of the deceased.","On 25 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Freeda Glausiusz, aged 32 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest yesterday.

I made a determination at inquest of death by suicide whilst suffering a psychotic episode.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 20 December 2021.

He had attended on the 9th July 2022 after visiting the nearby Urgent Care Centre (UCC) and being referred to ED by the GP there. He was provided with a printout of his consultation with her. She was worried about him. That communication detailed his complaint of loose stools and abdominal pain. The triage nurse did not record the content of the UCC letter accurately and took that letter from Mr Blewitt. He later saw the ED doctor who did not see or read the UCC letter or attempt to source it. The ED doctor did not record any questions relating to bowel habit on his contemporaneous note, but sometime subsequent to Mr Blewitt's death wrote a statement in which he identified that he had and that there were no bowel complaints. This was despite several days of being faecally incontinent at home and highlighting this to the UCC doctor. The ED doctor sent him home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant or recurrent urinary tract infection even though the MSU taken by his GP a few days earlier and available to the UCC doctor showed no growth. Mr Blewitt, even though he was sent home with a diagnosis of a possible resistant urinary tract infection on the 9th July 2022, was told to continue the original antibiotics his GP had started him on and then to start the new ones the next day.

At this visit a possible acute abdomen was diagnosed and CT scanning confirmed this. He was taken to theatre and suffered a cardiac arrest before surgery and died the next day on ITU. It emerged in evidence that there were no reliable records of any fluid resuscitation in the ED available for examination. This is because the computerised system records the prescription of IV fluids but unless the prescription is signed, that prescribed item is erased. The best information I received was that he had received two litres of an unknown fluid at some point during his time in the ED. It seems that doctors were not as a routine signing the prescriptions and so no reliable record was retained. I was told that doctors had been reminded on the need to sign prescriptions but no audit of this had been carried out since Mr Blewitt's death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

[1] At the time of Mr Blewitt's death there was no effective, reliable recording of intravenous fluids administered to patients in the emergency department. That in my view has potential to represent a threat to the safety and lives of patients suffering with a wide variety of different conditions. The author of the SI report who attended to give evidence did not, at the time of Inquest 8 months later, was unable to demonstrate that the Trust had remedied that.
[2] Despite the 8 month interval between Mr Blewitt's death and the Inquest the issues of concern had not been brought to the attention of hospital authorities.
[3] On arrival at the ED a triage nurse summarised the communication from the urgent care centre. The triage nurse missed important points during the transcription. The attending doctor did not concern himself to look at the communication himself.
[4] I was concerned that the treating doctor made a contemporaneous note on the 9th July 2022 at Mr Blewitt's first presentation which failed to record the major presenting symptom, diarrhoea with faecal incontinence, which Mr Blewitt had communicated to the urgent care doctor who in turn had included that in her notes and letter to the ED. The treating doctor did record a flatly contradictory note to the effect there was no change in bowel habit.
[5] The Incident Investigation Report which is in part designed to assist with learning from adverse events was of a generally poor standard. There was a failure to consider issues in detail; there was a failure to challenge the statements of clinicians where there were obvious contradictions between statements made and the medical record; there was a failure to put in place measures to correct and monitor prescribing clinicians failure to sign off on IV fluid prescriptions so that the contemporaneous record would be available for clinicians coming after them and they could see whether a patient had satisfactory or unsatisfactory fluid management. The only record in the case was a typed note by a junior doctor to the effect that it was thought Mr Blewitt had received 2 litres of fluid since arrival.","On 20 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alexander Shone BLEWITT aged 48.

She first sought advice from her general practitioner regarding related symptoms in July 2022, but there was no result from the qFIT (faecal immunochemical test) ordered.""","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 3 July 2023.

Jonny had PTSD, anxiety, suicidal ideation and was under the care of his local mental health trust. Jonny had not been seen since leaving his home on the afternoon of 7th August 2018 and was due in court on 8th August 2018 to face charges of criminal damage but did not attend.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

Ministry of Defence
1. I have a concern as to the number and availability of psychiatrists and psychologists within the Ministry of Defence and accessible to serving personnel. This concern extends to ensuring a soldier receives access to appropriate treatment including diagnosis.

Diagnosis is also important as under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme, mental disorders must be diagnosed by a relevant accredited medical specialist, namely, a medical practitioner whose name is included in the specialist register kept and published by the General Medical Council as required by section 34D of the Medical Act 1983.

At the time Jonny Cole was accessing the DCMH Lisburn, [REDACTED] gave evidence that there was just one psychiatrist for the whole of Northern Ireland who also had duties in the DCMH Kinloss, Scotland and no psychologist. 2 Rifles was based in Northern Ireland and at this time issues relative to Operation
Herrick 10 and traumatic combat experience were being identified.

[REDACTED] told me relative to the impact of Operation Herrick 10, ""Well all I can say is that we knew that we had a problem with post traumatic stress disorder and there were several suicides in Northern Ireland before I arrived. I can't comment on that too far because there was a board of inquiry and the regiment was moved from the isolated position of Ballykinler to Lisburn because of that. In order to make them less vulnerable,""

Following the evidence given by [REDACTED], I queried the Service expectations for the number of psychiatrists covering Northern Ireland and Scotland in 2010-2013 and now, and was provided with the following response from Defence Medical Services.

""NI is now covered by DCMH . The staffing of mental health posts is however now lower that that at the time the Coroner is concerned with. This is partly due to reducing military population in NI which would not justify a full-time consultant and partly due to significant difficulties in staffing mental health posts. Recruiting more mental health clinical staff is something that the DMS is working hard to do; however, the pool of mental health workers for both the DMS and NHS to draw from is finite.

Additionally, the DPHC Standard Operating Procedure on management of referrals makes some reference to this. Though it does not specify a manning ratio, it does give guidance on waiting
list management (para 13). In essence it states an Officer Rank 7 or Civil Service Band 6 has day to day responsibility for monitoring waiting lists and has direct access to the clinical lead, they are also responsible for all review arrangements and Multi-Disciplinary Team actions which are in place. It would follow from this if waiting lists are becoming unmanageable the named individual would be
able to escalate the problem"".

Chief of Staff at Defence Medical Services Headquarters, [REDACTED] gave evidence when asked about the current position as to whether there was shortage of consultant psychiatrists and psychologists within the DCMHs, that, ""we certainly have a shortage of mental health clinical staff at the moment. There are a lot of initiatives in place to try and continue to recruit those both military and civilian and we are working very hard at producing a more resilient and enduring so that we can actually build a career
structure for our mental health practices going forward, something we have lacked in defence up until now.""

This concern also extends to the knock-on effect that this apparent shortage of psychiatrists and psychologists has upon later claims for compensation by veterans as mental disorders must be
diagnosed by a relevant accredited medical specialist, namely, a medical practitioner whose name is included in the specialist register kept and published by the General Medical Council as required by section 34D of the Medical Act 1983.

2. I have a concern that the Vulnerability Risk Management Process [Suicide Vulnerability Risk Management as was] is Unit led and that DCMH clinicians do not have a greater role in influencing the Army's vulnerability risk management (VRM) process for suicidal soldiers.

3. I have a concern about:
a. the training and experience of the Medical Advisors at Veterans UK providing advice under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme.
b. rejection of claims for PTSD under the Armed Forces Compensation Scheme if there is not a formal diagnosis by a consultant psychiatrist or psychologist but evidence of PTSD within medical records from other medical professionals.

[REDACTED] was a retired GP who went on to work as a part-time medical advisor at Veterans UK in October 2013 and rejected Jonny's claim for compensation for PTSD and psychological injury under the armed forces compensation scheme. [REDACTED] had no specialist knowledge of psychiatric or mental health issues and had had no specialist training in that area.

In evidence [REDACTED] accepted that there was an issue with the advice he gave that resulted in Jonny's claim for compensation being rejected. In evidence told me:

""Q. Can I ask you: The approach that you adopted on Jonny Cole's case, in respect of his claim to PTSD, would you have applied a similar approach to other files or claims of veterans in respect of PTSD?

A. It's possible, I suppose, but I suppose as you gain experience and understanding of how the scheme is to be applied, then it changes. When I looked at this a week ago, which is when I first saw the documents, I could see straightaway the issue, but obviously I didn't see that in December 2013.

Q. So, then, can I ask you: Obviously, when you reviewed the file as part of your preparation to give evidence, and to be fair to you, you had not had that opportunity when you provided your statement,
you say you saw straightaway what the issue was. Can you tell us what it was that you saw when you reviewed the file, and what that issue is?

A. That there was a consultant diagnosis.

Q. Would there ever have been a scenario where you had rejected a claim, as part of the advice that you had given to the case workers, where a veteran would come back and say… Be raising issues again about PTSD, would it come back to you to review or would it go to a different medical adviser?
A. It could be either, and in fact if a review was requested or an appeal requested, I think it had to be a different case worker, but I don't think it necessarily had to be a different medical adviser.

Q. Just so then I am clear about you reviewed the file with obviously then the knowledge… Admittedly you do not work for Veterans UK anymore, but you had had the number of years then working and giving advice. But when you saw straightaway what the issue was, and there was a consultant diagnosis, if you had reviewed Jonny Cole's case nearer to the end of your time at Veterans UK, what would your advice have been in respect of Jonny Cole's claim, to the case workers?

A. Well, it would have been a different approach, because I would… Once you have accepted that there is a diagnosis, then the next stage is what's the cause of that, and is that predominantly caused by factors of service? And then, if the answer to that is yes, on the balance of probabilities it is caused by factors of service, then I would have recommended an award.

Q. Then, in terms of what you have effectively told us, that if you had reviewed this case later down your experience with Veterans UK, Jonny certainly would have got over the hurdle of a consultant
diagnosis

A. Yes.

Q. but again, having reviewed the documentation, and obviously you were the individual that was asked to provide advice as to causation, to provide advice as to whether or not on the balance of
probability it is linked to factors relating to service… Have you gone on to consider that aspect also?

A. Not particularly no, but I would have thought there's enough there to say yes it was.""

[REDACTED] indicated that the ""narrow look"" he undertook in respect of Jonny's claim for compensation was due to, ""Certainly not lack of time. I think it would be fair to say possibly lack of experience, and lack of training. And I think the emphasis I think was quite strong on that principle, even within the table tariff for the AFCS, on the section 3 I think it is, which is for psychological things, I think it does state it there, that a diagnosis can only be accepted by accredited consultant psychiatrist, so I suppose that in a sense
emphasises it, and perhaps that's why it was so prominent in my thinking.""

[REDACTED] gave expert evidence to me about the impact of the denial of compensation by Veterans UK for psychological injury and decisions where there is a denial of payments to which a veteran is entitled which, invalidates psychological injury, can cause hostility and being aggrieved and lead to self-destructive behaviour by the veteran.

Jonny Cole himself raised by email to Veterans UK in June 2018, and shortly before his death in August 2018, the ongoing issues he was having with his PTSD that was getting worse and the impact it was
having on his mental health, which had led to hospital admission due to overdose, and included a letter that identified that Jonny had reported thinking of suicide on a daily basis.

Jonny Cole did not receive a response to this email before his death but when this response was provided by letter dates 20th August 2018 it stated;

""We cannot take any further action on your claim at the moment. This is because the scheme rules state when considering a claim for a mental disorder, we require a diagnosis made by a clinical psychologist or
psychiatrist at consultant grade. We are unable to accept a diagnosis made by a GP or community psychiatric nurse.

Evidence we have considered so far: We have looked at the evidence we already have but it does not include confirmation of a formal diagnosis.

What happens next: In order for us to be able to fully consider your claim, please could you provide us with evidence of a diagnosis from a consultant psychologist or psychiatrist. We are unable to take any further action until we hear from you. If we do not receive a response from you within 3 months of our request, your claim will be closed.""

[REDACTED] suggested that thought needed to be given to having a Panel that is more representative of all stake holders not just the MOD and for more credibility to be given to civilian diagnosis and evidence and for there to be someone independent to review the cases.

Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust [The Trust]
4. I have a concern that the Trust is doing too little to identify and address the risk of suicide for Veterans.

A 2021 Nottinghamshire Suicide Prevention Action Plan to which the Trust was a partner identified for Veterans the need to, ""undertake evidence review on the needs of veterans in relation to mental health and suicide, to inform future developments. Promote and raise awareness of the Op Courage MH Pathway and Armed Forces Health eLearning (commissioned by NHSE/Improvement Armed Forces Health). Ensure an ongoing dialogue with NHSE/Improvement around provision of mental health, suicide prevention and postvention. bereavement support to veterans and engage in any NHSE Midlands masterclass with Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) - date to be agreed. Identify veterans within the local Suicide Cluster Response Plan Guidance in the first annual refresh Review learning from the NHSE/Improvement review/investigation of Serious Incidents.""

Despite this, the Trust's Suicide Prevention Strategy and Suicide Prevention Annual Plan 2020-2023 provided to me and due to be reviewed this year does not specifically touch upon Veterans. I am told that there is a commitment to ensure this is a key feature of the review already commencing within the organisation.

5. I have a concern that there is:
a) a lack of understanding as to the appropriate services to make referrals to for Veterans by Trust mental health practitioners;
b) a lack of understanding as to services available for Veterans;
c) too much emphasis on Veterans being solely responsible for self-referral, with no assistance to assist in accessing appropriate services;
d) A lack of understanding (or effort) as to how to request and obtain military DCMH medical records.

I acknowledge that steps have been made recently by the Trust to, ""liaise directly with Operation Courage in order to request their attendance at staff team events to further improve liaison and staff understanding of their pathways and exactly what their offer to Veterans"", however it is essential that these pathways are known by all mental health practitioners and engagement undertaken with the services to which a Veteran is referred, to check if this is an appropriate referral.

This needs to include an understanding by mental health practitioners of what is in fact offered by: Operation Courage; the Centre for Trauma Resilience and Growth; Help 4 Heroes; Combat Stress and other charities and in particular what can be offered by way of psychological and trauma therapy.

I was not reassured from the Trust witnesses who gave evidence to me who had involvement with Jonny that they had this understanding or of the specific needs of Veterans.

As [REDACTED] told me, it takes a lot for a veteran to put their hand up and ask for help and tend not to ask for help until things are really bad and there is a need to act quickly and as compassionately as possible to work with that window of opportunity and to assist the Veteran in making the referral.

6. I have a concern as to the quality of the Trust's Investigation Report and that the process of review is not sufficiently robust

I acknowledge that the Trust recognises that the investigation reports provided in respect of Jonny Cole's death were unsatisfactory and also and that the review of Rapid Response Liaison Psychiatry involvement in 2022, ""was a missed opportunity to retrospectively review the investigation in its entirety"". However, it is of concern that the 2022 review was also insufficient and inadequate.

The concerning information relating to the attempt Jonny made to ligate in a tree was not analysed. [REDACTED] told me that an attempt on life by suicide increases the risk 100-fold that you would die by suicide in the next 12 months and is the most significant risk factor in Jonny's history that massively elevated the risk until that period of time has lapsed which requires clinical risk assessment].

The Investigation report and the updated report following review failed to identify themes of concern2, and did not reassure me that the Trust had taken an appropriate response to investigate the concerning facts of this case and to ensure lessons were learned and not repeated for other patients and appropriate audit undertaken.

I am told that the Trust is, ""committed to continuing our improvement journey in this area"", however, I remain concerned that the Trust's investigation was insufficient, lacked robustness and did not fully engage with the duty of candour.","In 2018 an investigation was commenced into the death of Jonathan ""Jonny"" Philip Cole [JC], aged 39. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 25 April 2023. The conclusion of the Inquest was a 
Narrative Conclusion namely:

Narrative Conclusion

a. JC developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder as a result of at least three traumatic experiences whilst serving in the British Army in Afghanistan on operational tour in 2009 one of which represented a direct threat to his life (where he also suffered physical injuries including hearing loss and tinnitus, shrapnel injuries following a Rocket-Propelled Grenade attack (RPG);

[Note: This service had been with 2 Rifles as part of Operation Herrick 10.]

b. JC had made multiple attempts at suicide and self-harm beginning in January 2010 which were caused or materially contributed to by his unresolved symptoms of PTSD, culminating in a final and successful suicide attempt in August 2018;

c. JC did not receive Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing [EMDR] for those symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress before the summer of 2012, it consisted of no more than 8 sessions of EMDR, which on balance of probability proved latterly to be insufficient albeit the EMDR did provide JC with temporary improvement and some alleviation of symptoms of PTSD in 2012/2013;

d. JC's intrusive memories of the RPG incident were not verified as having been fully processed in the presence of JC's treating CPN before EMDR was discontinued in 2012 albeit JC had confirmed his belief in 2012 that he had managed to self-process that memory;

e. JC received no psychological trauma therapy from 2013 onward up until the time of his death other than the EMDR provided whilst still in the British Army;

f. JC left the Army in 2013 without a formal diagnosis of having had PTSD as a result of operational trauma. This was a failure and a diagnosis of PTSD was appropriate at that time;

g. JC''s unresolved symptoms of PTSD caused or contributed to episodic periods of profound mental health crisis, often preceded, and accompanied by, thoughts and attempts to end his life by way of overdose, and latterly hanging. His unresolved symptoms of PTSD also contributed to use of alcohol and drugs to manage the symptoms which in turn led to marital and relationship problems and financial problems;

h. JC's PTSD was accompanied by alcohol and drug use, exacerbating the severity of the underlying condition;

i. The continued lack of any official recognition, acknowledgment, or diagnosis on the part of the MOD of his PTSD in the context of JC's attempts to access financial compensation for his condition, was a failure and materially contributed to a deterioration in his mental health state in the period following his discharge from the Army up until his death and resulted in JC making contact again on 8th June 2018 which was not responded to before his death;

j. The Risk assessment and Care Plan completed on 28th January 2018 was inadequate and under estimated the risk of suicide for JC;

k. There was a failure to conduct a psychiatric review in January 2018 despite a referral for psychiatric review this failure also caused unnecessary delay before a medication review took place;

l. The Risk assessment and Care Plan completed on 14th May 2018 was inadequate and underestimated the risk of suicide;

m. JC's mental health had deteriorated significantly in 2018 and deterioration continued whilst under care of local mental health team and with knowledge that no psychological trauma therapy was being provided;

n. By the beginning of 2018 JC's medication was no longer proving effective as he became increasingly depressed, as well as socially, and occupationally isolated. This led to a change in medication in June 2018, which whilst appropriately indicated was not effectively managed and documented as ineffective on 28th July 2018 when consideration should have been given to appropriately increasing the dose of Paroxetine to assist JC's low mood;

o. Further risk assessments and Care plans should have been completed when Fluoxetine was reduced and removed and Paroxetine introduced;

p. A further risk assessment and care plan should have been completed on 26th July 2018 in light of having elicited JC's recent arrest and changes in his psycho social position4
including issues of accommodation and financial pressures. This consultation underestimated the risk of suicide. There was a failure of the treating mental health professional to identify that JC was to appear in court 8.8.18. There was a lost opportunity therefore to make contact with the police/ CPS and to liaise with the criminal justice liaison and divergence with relevant information as to the medication review underway and relevant factors of JC's mental health. There was an under estimation of the risk of suicide on 26.7.18 by not identifying the upcoming court date of 8.8.18 and offering support to JC;

q. There was a missed opportunity throughout 2018 to refer JC to the Transition Intervention and Liaison Service [TILS] and the Centre for Trauma Resilience and Growth.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 31st July 2023.

Ms Shafighian was assessed by a specialist ENT trainee on 3/2/2020 who ordered a CT scan, which found no evidence of laryngeal cancer. Maria was diagnosed with vocal cord palsy and referred to the Speech and Language Therapists (SALT).  

On 4/5/2020 the SALT team noted that Maria was suffering from dysphagia which I heard was a worrying development which may need urgent assessment. I heard that the SALT team referred Maria back to the ENT team and notified them of this development.

After further assessment, Maria was diagnosed with oesophageal cancer. She was not a candidate for surgical intervention and received palliative chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Maria Shafighian died from the effects of oesophageal cancer at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr on 24/11/2020

In the inquest I determined that there had been opportunities missed to identify and treat Maria's tumour earlier but I could not determine on balance that this would have altered the outcome and hence the conclusion was death by natural causes.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
During the inquest I heard that the process by which the SALT team notified the ENT department of the change in Maria's presentation and the development of dysphagia was through an internal postal system. Following assessment by SALT on 4/5/2020, a letter was written to the ENT team which was printed and left in a pigeon hole.

No evidence was forthcoming to describe a system whereby urgent matters would be brought immediately to the attention of the referring team and there was no process for ensuring that the post was dealt with in a timely manner.

In Maria's case there appears to have been a delay of a month between the letter being sent and being noticed by the ENT team.",,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.

Jean Frickel had required an ambulance on 19 December 2022 due to symptoms of shortness of breath and confusion following a GP home visit. She was in reasonably poor health. A call was made by her husband to WAST at 17:09 hours. At 08.07 hours the following morning a further call was made informing WAST that Jean Frickel was unresponsive and not breathing. Paramedics arrived at 08:12 and confirmed that she had died. It took 13 hours and 3 minutes from the initial call for paramedics to arrive. Cardiology evidence indicated that had Mrs Frickel received timely medical treatment then her life may have been prolonged by several weeks.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

There was evidence from WAST and BCUHB that improvements had been made internally within their organisations. It seems that patient flow i.e. those patients who are ready to be discharged from hospital but are unable to be discharged due to insufficiencies in social care means that ambulances are unable to offload patients into the Emergency Department which then causes the community delays as ambulances are not readily available.

I have not been presented with any meaningful evidence on the involvement of Local Authorities in the considerations by WAST and BCUHB of lack of patient flow due to social care deficiencies.

I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to BCUHB and WAST pertaining to the length of time it is taking for ambulances to arrive to patients (as well as handover at hospitals).

I remain significantly concerned that delays are continuing and that deaths will continue to occur into the future.

Specifically, I require responses to the following:
1. Extent of working relationship between WAST, BCU and North Wales Local Authorities to address the above issues; and
2. Extent of progress between WAST, BCU and North Wales Local Authorities in addressing the above issues; and
Extent of Strategic plan of action / improvement plan to address the above issues.","On 30 December 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Jean Frickel (DOB 4/2/43) who died on 20 December 2022. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 June 2023. 

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows: 
Jean Frickel died on 20/12/22 at her home address from a naturally occurring disease process.

Mrs Cumbers was known to have Hyperthyroidism, Hypertension, Osteoarthritis, Hypercholesterolaemia and a stable Angina.

On 29 March 2022, Mrs CUMBERS was admitted to Colchester Hospital, having presented with skin eruption following use of Carbimazole, prescribed for an overactive Thyroid, by her GP at above named Practice.

Mrs Cumbers suffered an allergic reaction to the prescribed Carbimazole, she stopped Carbimazole and reported it to the GP practice on 21 March.

She was seen by a GP on 22 March in person, on 24 March there was a failed home visit with no follow up call directly to Mrs Cumbers, on 25 March there was a consultation via telephone, on 28 March she spoke to reception and later a nurse over the telephone and on 29 March she was seen at home.

The GP Practice carried out an internal review of the incident, including the consultations conducted by the various GPs and other clinical staff and produced a ""Significant Event Analysis"" report. This report was admitted as evidence as part of the coronial investigation and identified that a clinician should have followed up on the failed encounter and the consultation on 28 March did not meet the required standards and the management of the care was found to be wrong, leading to a delay in administration of antibiotics and hospital admission. The evidence showed that this event did not cause or contributed to the death on the balance of probabilities.

However, the Practice confirmed in evidence that no actions have been taken to embed the learnings identified in the Significant Event Analysis report, to ensure the appropriate standards are upheld by the Practice's clinical staff

She was operated on for a fracture to the neck of femur. Post-operatively she developed pneumonia. Subsequently the wound became infected, and a wound wash and debridement took place. She became increasingly frail. She was discharged home with support from the discharge to assess team. She felt unwell on 13th December 2022 and called for an ambulance with chest pains. Her initial call was dealt with as a category 5 call, and she contacted her GP. Her GP visited her and was concerned about her presentation. A further call to the ambulance service resulted in her being classified as a category 2 call. The blood tests taken indicated she was in severe heart failure and at a risk of a myocardial infarction. The ambulance arrived significantly outside the target Department of Health response times. The ambulance crew identified she needed urgent cardiac treatment and she was for transfer to hospital. Enroute to hospital she deteriorated further and died in the ambulance from complications of heart failure.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 

The inquest heard evidence that under the Department of Health's Ambulance Response time criteria, a category 2 call should have an average response time of 18 minutes and be within 40 minutes in 9 out of 10 cases.

The evidence before the inquest was that in her case the response time on the category 2 call was 1 hour and 5 minutes - significantly outside the target time. A response within the target time would have meant that she would not have deteriorated and died in the ambulance. She would have been in a hospital with access to treatment available in such a setting.

The evidence before the inquest was that her case was not a one off and delays of this nature had been occurring throughout the day. The mean time for Category 2 response times that day was 1 hour and 22 minutes and the 90th percentile was just over 3 hours.

At 17.58 that day there were 142 emergencies waiting in Greater Manchester alone and 430 across the North West. The average response time at that point for Category 2 patients was 2 hours and 33 minutes.
The inquest heard that the cause of these significant delays in patients receiving care in a timely manner was multifactorial and included the demand for ambulances across Greater Manchester and the North West and the long ambulance delays at A and E departments due to the demand on A and E services.","On 19th December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joan Mary Corcoran. The investigation concluded on the 15th May 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative:

The Deceased's discharge from Eagleton Ward was authorised via his mother using her Nearest Relative Powers pursuant to the provisions of Mental Health Act 1983, and its associated Code of Practice. The Deceased then returned to the family home.  

The evidence that I heard at the Inquest was such that the Deceased was still liable to be held under Section 3 Mental Health Act 1983; however, due to the difference in the test being applied for consideration of an application by a Nearest Relative, there was no choice but to discharge the Deceased Further evidence alluded to the concerns from clinicians about this power, and although the evidence was that it is seldomly used, it presents an opportunity for patients and families to deviate from the clinical course prescribed by clinicians.

There was no consideration for a Community Treatment Order for the Deceased as the provisions of the legislation refer to discharge from detention.

The Deceased remained unwell in the community, and on 10th November 2020 he went missing. His body was found in a local reservoir on 26th November 2020. There was insufficient evidence to determine how he came to enter the water.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

12/06/2023,2023-0193,Heather Findlay,Mary Hassell,Inner North London,Suicide (from 2015),"East London NHS Foundation Trust, Metropolitan Police Service, NHS England and Home Department",https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/heather-findlay-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Heather-Findlay-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0193_Published.pdf,"At the time of her death, Heather Findlay was in the care of the East London Foundation Trust (ELFT), detained under section 2 of the Mental Health Act at Mile End Hospital.

At approximately 3pm on 11 June 2020, she was on s17 escorted leave, standing with a healthcare assistant (HCA) at the front gates of the hospital having a cigarette, when she turned to the HCA, said ""I'm sorry I have to do this to you"" and ran away.

ELFT contacted the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) at 3.17pm, but by 3.58pm, Ms Findlay had been found by a member of the public in a nearby park.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

1. When Ms Findlay ran off, the HCA escorting her was so panicked that she did not even think of following. Ms Findlay had run across a road and so chasing her at speed did present safety considerations. However, the ELFT policy, training, culture and expectation was such, that there the HCA did not at any point consider attempting to walk after her to keep her in sight. Clinical staff must be adequately prepared for such an eventuality.

That means more than simply a change in policy wording.

2. By the time the HCA rang the duty senior nurse for advice Ms Findlay was out of sight, and so the HCA was instructed to return to the ward.

I heard evidence that an email is to be sent out shortly to explain that a new ELFT absent without leave policy will be in place by the end of June 2023. The new policy will confirm that, if it is safe to do so an escort may follow a patient who has absconded, keeping them in line of sight whilst ringing the duty senior nurse for instructions.

However, there is no ELFT policy for what those instructions should be or even what they could include. No member of ELFT gave evidence of any organisational thought having gone into how then to progress such a situation, other than the ward calling the police to report a missing person. No member of ELFT giving evidence was able to set out what the staff member following should do.

This appears to be a significant omission.

3.Moreover, one of the MPS policy leads in this area gave evidence that in such a situation the police would not necessarily attend, even if called direct by a hospital staff member in the street following a patient about whom they are worried.

I spent some time examining the police regarding this point, and I was left with the impression that a clinician calling the police in what the clinician perceived to be an emergency situation might not be assisted by the police.

That concerned me.

4.I heard that Right Care, Right Person is an operational model developed by Humberside Police that changes the way the emergency services respond to calls involving concerns about mental health. I understand that it is in the process of being rolled out across the UK as part of ongoing work between police forces, health providers and government.

I heard that the MPS has already created a similar model under the resource and demand team. The protocol is called Affinity. It attempts to target preventable demand from the mental health trusts.

I was told that ELFT and the MPS work in partnership, so I asked the MPS what is meant to happen if an escort is following a patient who has run away and about whom the escort is worried.

I was told that this is primarily a health problem. It was pointed out that doctors, nurses and other hospital staff have the same powers as the police under section 18 of the Mental Health Act. Hospital employees have the legal authority to take a sectioned patient into custody and return them to hospital.

However, I heard nothing of an ELFT protocol that would advise staff on the ward to come out to assist an escort who already following a patient. I heard nothing of a trust contingency plan that would allow a ward to function without the doctors and nurses needed to undertake such a task. I heard nothing of any training given to doctors and nurses in how to restrain a patient in the middle of the street and to transport them back to the ward.

From the evidence I heard, the police / health trust partnership working allows each agency to regard such a situation as the other's responsibility, whilst nobody is on the ground attempting to retrieve a seriously ill patient who is meant to be inside a locked ward for their own safety.

Whether this is a matter of policy or practice, the result is the same. If partner agency working is to be effective in caring for this extremely vulnerable cohort of patients, there needs to be crystal clear understanding by all those involved, from the highest policy maker to the most junior member of a team at the sharp end, of how to tackle these difficult situations and exactly who is meant to be doing what.

5. Evidence was given that the police classify a person at high risk as: the risk is immediate and there are substantial grounds for believing immediate risk of self harm.

I was told by the MPS that, at the time of reporting to the MPS, trusts should volunteer their own grading of the patient's risk. The police said that they will not necessarily following the trust grading, but they regard it as a significant factor and it should form part of the MPS thinking. ELFT witnesses told me that if the police did not ask for the trust's grading then the trust would not offer it.

I was told that, until April 2022 the grab pack prepared by ELFT for the MPS in such a situation was printed out and handed to police if & when the police attended the ward. It is now filled out on a portal as part of the reporting procedure. However, it is not clear to me how far the grab pack aligns with local policies, whether all useful information (including the trust's grading of risk) is recorded as a matter of routine, and how far the police and the trust are using the same terminology with the same definitions.

It seems that this would benefit from consideration.

6.ELFT staff all told me that, after Ms Findlay had run off, they still graded her as medium rather than high risk. She had had long term suicidal thoughts, had made previous attempts on her life and, prior to being admitted to hospital on 20 May 2020 had purchased sodium nitrate and had planned to take this to kill herself. However, she had appeared to improve in hospital, and had been granted 15 minutes' escorted leave twice a day since 1 June without incident.

At one point in her evidence it appeared to me that the matron, taking the point that by running away Ms Findlay had acted in a manner that was wholly unexpected by the trust, was of the view that Ms Findlay should then have been re-categorised as high risk. However, following re-examination by counsel for ELFT the matron appeared to retract this and to return to her former position that, even after she had run away Ms Findlay was only of medium risk to herself.

It is of course a matter of clinical opinion what risk grading a patient should be given, and no person can see into the future.

However,
·the jury found a failure by ELFT to recognise that, by 11 June 2020, Ms Findlay was at imminent risk of suicide by sodium nitrate; and
·any investigation following a death like Heather Findlay's presents an opportunity for sober and searching reflection.

So I am concerned that an element of positional bias may have influenced the thinking of ELFT staff.

I am concerned about this particularly because, when giving evidence at inquest, the ELFT serious incident investigation author was adamant that it was only appropriate for the HCA who called the police on 11 June 2020 after Ms Findlay had run away, to tell the police of a risk of self harm not of a risk of suicide. Her rationale for this was that the last time Ms Findlay had articulated a plan to kill herself, was when she was found in hospital with a ligature round her neck on 28 May 2020.

This position seems lacking the necessary reflection.

I draw your attention to earlier prevention of future deaths reports (PFDs) as follows:

·Sent to ELFT on 8 June 2023 by Assistant Coroner Buckett following the inquest touching the death of Hilary (Billy) Guedalla, including concern regarding the failure of ELFT to inform the police of the serious suicide risk that the deceased posed to themselves; and the confusion among staff about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.

·Sent to ELFT on 25 January 2023 by me following the inquest touching the death of Andrew Largin, including concern about omissions from a serious incident investigation.

·Sent to ELFT on 20 October 2021 by me following the inquest touching the death of Freeda Glausiusz, including concern about a lack of learning culture at ELFT.","On 16 June 2020, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Heather Findlay, aged 28 years.

She complained of a 5-day history of shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Raquel had a low oxygen saturation, a high respiratory rate and a tachycardia. The assessing doctor used the pulmonary embolism rule out criteria (PERC), to rule out the likelihood of a pulmonary embolism causing her symptoms. The PERC test was positive, and a D Dimer should have been carried out. This was not done. A diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was made, based upon a low haemoglobin and low MCV level. Raquel was admitted to hospital and suffered from periods of desaturation requiring medical review and assessment. The diagnosis of iron deficiency anaemia was not re-visited and further investigations, such as arterial blood gases were not carried out. In the very early hours of 25 June 2021, Raquel became critically unwell. She required escalation of her
care, but this was not provided until she was in a peri-arrest state at around 0330 on 25 June 2021. Raquel suffered a cardiac arrest at around 0400 and received resuscitation and thrombolysis. Sadly, there was no response to the emergency efforts and Raquel passed away at Whipps Cross Hospital on 25 June 2021. Had Raquel received the D Dimer test on the 23 June 2021, in accordance with the Trust's policy, this is likely to have triggered further investigations which would have resulted in a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and a treatment dose of lower molecular weight heparin. On the balance of probabilities this would have prevented Raquel's death on the 25 June 2021.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1.There was a lack of thorough history taking and a number of assumptions were made on the basis of Raquel's high BMI. There was an assumed chronic low oxygen saturation with no evidence that the doctors had checked the records available or asked the patient about her baseline. The oxygen saturations recorded in the Barts sleep apnoea clinic in 2015 and 2016 were noted to be 99% and 100%.

2. There was a lack of escalation of monitoring following the NEWS score of 10. It is of concern that the NEWS policy was not complied with by the nursing staff.

There was disagreement between senior clinicians as to how the Trust's PE policy should have been applied. The policy is often not used in accordance with the specific wording. For example, the requirement for pleuritic chest pain is often ignored in practice. A senior clinician within the Trust considered that the caveat for pleuritic chest pain in the policy should be reviewed. In addition, the senior clinician described some of the wording in the policy as ""clumsy"". In light of this, the Trust may wish to review the policy.","On the 26th July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raquel Mellonie Harper, aged 33 years.

During the same period, his partner tried to contact the prison through the prison switchboard, but was not able to make any contact with him. In his suicide note to his partner, Mr Dean wrote ""I tried to get to talk to you but these lot here wouldn't let me.""  I am concerned that there are no clearly defined processes to ensure that new prisoners can successfully make first contact with family members (when this does not take place on the first night) and for logging and handling incoming calls to the central switchboard from family members with concerns about a prisoner's safety and/or requesting a welfare check.

Following the inquest, I gave the Ministry of Justice an opportunity to address these concerns by providing further evidence of any new procedures that have been put in place since Andrew Dean's death, but they declined to do so. In my view, these are matters that require further consideration by the Ministry of Justice and HMP Lewes to avoid a risk of future deaths through self-harm or suicide. I refer to the enclosed letter from the solicitors for Mr Dean's partner dated 19 May 2023.",On 29 March 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew DEAN aged 50.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

Evidence was given by staff members of the East London Foundation NHS Trust that:

1.The deceased was allowed to leave Gardener Ward (""the unit"") which was part of a secure facility of the hospital, alone, when a clinical decision had been taken that they should not be allowed to leave the unit unaccompanied by staff, because they posed a serious risk of suicide.

2.The decision that the deceased should not be allowed unescorted leave was not communicated to all members of staff working in the unit such that the person who allowed the deceased to leave was unaware that the decision had been made.

3.The relevant information gathered during the Ward Round on the 28th October 2021, which included the fact that the deceased had attempted to take their own life, the night before, was not adequately communicated to all staff on the unit.

4.The ""Sign in/Sign out"" book which was supposed to record the movements of service users in the unit was frequently not completed, particularly when service users went out for short periods.

5.There was no proper system for identifying whether a service user should be permitted to leave the unit.

6.The member of staff who allowed the deceased to leave the unit made a brief risk assessment of them before deciding whether they should be allowed to leave. That person did not consult any medical notes or records about the deceased when making that assessment. Had that member of staff consulted the deceased's medical notes and records, the serious suicide risk which they posed would have been evident.

7.Once the deceased was found to be missing from the unit, there was an unexplained delay in informing the police and ambulance service, a failure to inform either of the serious suicide risk which the deceased posed to themselves and a lack of appreciation of the urgency of the situation by staff generally.

8.The hospital policy which applied to missing patients was not properly adhered to by staff and there was confusion about who should be contacted and in what manner, once a patient was found to be missing.

9.No proper efforts were made to contact members of the deceased's family once the deceased was found to be missing.

10.The unit was short-staffed and this affected the care provided to the deceased, the assessment of the deceased whilst in the unit and record keeping generally.

The summary of the evidence given, as set out above, sets out the matters of concern.","On the 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hilary Clare (Billy) Guedalla who died aged 46 on the 30th October 2021[REDACTED].

The investigation resulted in an inquest, which was conducted by myself over a period of 5 days and concluded on 19th May 2023.

I made a determination at inquest that the deceased died as a result of suicide and returned a narrative conclusion as follows:

1. The deceased suffered from long standing psychiatric conditions of a Recurrent Depressive Disorder and complex Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.

2. On occasions, the deceased's psychiatric conditions led to psychiatric in-patient admission to hospital, usually as a voluntary patient, on a number of occasions between 2013 and 2021. Those admissions were associated with the deceased exhibiting suicidal ideation and sometimes involved attempts to take their own life.

3.On the 26th October 2021, the deceased was admitted to Gardener Ward, Homerton Hospital, London E9 as a voluntary patient suffering a worsening of their psychiatric condition.

4.At a ward round at that hospital on the 28th October 2021, at around 11am, the deceased indicated to staff that they had tried to take her own life the night before in hospital and that they had equipment at home for the purposes of ending their life.

5.The deceased's condition worsened thereafter and staff at the hospital considered that the deceased should not be allowed out of the ward alone, for her own safety because, in effect they were a high risk of suicide. That decision was made in the morning of the 29th October 2021 but not communicated to all staff on the ward.

6.The deceased asked a member of the clinical staff to leave the ward, at around 6pm on the 29th October 2021. That member of staff was unaware of the decision that had been made that the deceased should not be allowed out alone. The member of staff carried out a brief assessment of the deceased, largely based on their appearance, but did not refer to any medical notes and records. The deceased was then allowed to leave the ward.

7.Sometime between leaving the ward and around 3pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased took their own life by hanging themselves [REDACTED]. No-one else was involved. The deceased was found by members of the London Fire Brigade between 3 and 4pm, on that day.

8. After the deceased had left the ward, night staff found the deceased to be missing at around 8pm on the 29th October 2021. Staff first contacted the police 2.10am and again at 2.46am on the 30th October, 2021 and requested that the police carry out a welfare check. They did not inform the police that the deceased was a serious suicide risk. They were advised to contact the London Ambulance Service but did not do this until 3pm on the 30th October 2021 and in any event, that request did not generate attendance at the deceased's home address.

9. At around 2pm on the 30th October 2021, the deceased's mother attended the ward having made a pre-arranged booking to visit the deceased. She was shocked to be informed that the deceased had left the ward. She enlisted support from family and friends which led to the attendance of emergency services at the deceased's home address, between 3-4pm on the 30th October 2021.


10.The deceased should not have been permitted to leave the ward alone. Had clinical staff observed the decision not to allow the deceased out without a staff member, the deceased would not have taken their own life when they did.

11.The decision that the deceased should not be permitted unescorted leave failed to be communicated to all staff members on the ward.

12.The information that the deceased had tried to end their own life on the ward on the evening of the 27th October 2021 was also not properly communicated to all staff on the ward or added to any document which concerned a proper risk of assessment of them. Also, the hospital staff did not fully comply with the patient admission policy when the deceased was admitted on the 26th October 2021 as records were not properly updated and no physical health assessment was made of the deceased within 24 hours.

13.The decision that the deceased was to receive 1:1 support following the ward round of the 28th October 2021 could not realistically be met because of staff shortages on the ward. There was a failure to recognise that this plan would could not realistically be achieved because of those staffing issues.

14.The assessment made of the deceased before the deceased was allowed to leave the ward at 6pm on the 29th October 2021 by that member of staff was inadequate as a risk assessment of the deceased's mental state for the purposes of assessing their safety. That member of staff relied solely on the deceased's presentation at that moment and did not consider any written record about the deceased or ask any other member of staff about how the deceased was.

15.There was a complete failure to appreciate the urgency of locating the deceased once the night staff found them to be missing at about 8pm on the 29th October 2021 and to follow the hospital policy which applied to missing patients.

16. Night shift staff took far too long to contact the emergency services and failed to contact the ambulance service as advised by the police in the early hours of the 30th October 2021.

17. When the police were contacted, staff completely failed to state the urgent and serious suicide risk which the deceased presented to themselves.

18. Hospital staff also failed to properly contact Billy's family and friends after they went missing from the ward or leave messages for them which could have enabled them to be located.

19.Staffing levels on both the 29th and 30th October 2021 were not adequate and this contributed to the failings set out above.

20. The failure set out above which relates to the staff member being unaware that the deceased should not leave the ward unaccompanied, amounts to a serious failure which directly caused or contributed to the deceased's death.

21. The other failures set out above amount to missed opportunities which may directly or indirectly, have prevented the deceased's death.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that your organisation has the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 4th August 2023.

22/05/2023,2023-0168,Karl Mitchell,Peter Harrowing,Avon,Accident at Work and health and Safety related deaths | Other related deaths,"Department for Transport, Health and Safety Executive, and Titan Containers Limited",https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/61812-2/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Karl-Mitchell-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0168_Published.pdf,"The Deceased was a lorry driver with Titan Containers Limited a company who provided shipping type containers to various sites which were then used for storage and as temporary site facilities. The containers were loaded and off loaded using a lorry mounted crane. The lorry used by the Deceased was fitted with a hydraulic stabiliser beam and swing-up (rotating) hydraulic stabilising leg at each corner. These were deployed during the loading and off loading procedure so as to stabilise the vehicle whilst the crane was in use. 

On 23rd September 2021 the Deceased was delivering a container to a local primary school for the purposes of temporary storage during building works. The Deceased successfully off loaded the container and was in the process of retracting the nearside front stabiliser beam when he was crushed by the swing up (rotating) leg causing him to suffer a cardiac arrest. 

The fire and rescue services attended and he was released using the 'jaws of life'. He was attended by paramedics and conveyed to hospital where he died on 25th September 2021 as a result of his injuries. 

On this particular vehicle the control panel for the stabiliser beams and legs was mounted on the front nearside of the vehicle adjacent to the lorry mounted crane. In order to stow, in this case, the nearside stabiliser beam for road use it is necessary to rotate the swing up leg through 180° from the downward position to the vertical position. This enables the beam and leg to be stowed behind the cab of the vehicle when it is being driven on the road. 

Whilst carrying out this procedure the operator, in this case the Deceased, stands at the control panel with their back to retracting beam and leg. The swing up leg on the nearside when rotating upwards rotates in anticlockwise direction. Therefore the leg rotates directly behind the operator standing at the control panel. Whilst carrying out this procedure the Deceased was unaware that the swing up leg had not rotated fully to the upright position but was at an angle of approximately 80° from the downwards position. Therefore as the beam continued to be retracted the swing up leg crushed the Deceased against the control panel. Whilst further retraction of the beam could be stopped the hydraulic pressure remained trapping the Deceased and causing crush injuries.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) There are a large number of these lorry mounted cranes with such stabiliser beams and rotating legs in use by companies of all sizes and for a variety of uses within the industry.

(2) Whilst manufacturers have taken steps to modify the design of the stabiliser beams and rotating legs so as to ensure the risk of such crush injuries can be avoided in the future such modifications will only apply to new vehicles and those where the owner I operator of the vehicle becomes aware of possibility of modifications being available.

(3) Vehicles without being modified will continue to be used throughout the industry and thereby such vehicles will continue to pose a risk of crush injuries occurring to the operator.

(4)Action needs to be taken to disseminate the learning from this tragic incident throughout the industry so that operators of such vehicles are aware that safety modifications may be available for their vehicle and in any event operators need to be made aware of the risk of crushing so as to ensure safe operation at all times.","On 29th September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr. Karl Mitchell age 50 years.

This happened in this case and resulted in his death the following day, 31 December 2022, at Pinderfields Hospital, Wakefield.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) The Consent form signed by Mr Wilson was a standard pre-printed form. It did not attempt to provide any statistical rating for the risks identified, which would have enabled Mr Wilson to evaluate the risks.
(2) No attempt was made to interpret or tailor the risks inherent in the procedure in the light of his extensive medical history and co-morbidities.
(3) The Consent Form did not refer to the risks of death, which befell him. He was thus not in a position to make a truly informed consent to undergo the sigmoidoscopy.
(4) The Consent Form did not identify those clinicians involved in discussing the decision with him, save for who obtained his signature at a time when he was under the influence of morphine sedation.

The objective of the Consent process should be to demonstrate a patient has made a truly informed decision at a time when he is able to evaluate the risks clear! .","On 18 January 2023 I commenced an investigation into the death of David Barnet WILSON, aged 67.

There were no complications during the surgery nor in her post- operative care leading to discharge to Ripley Rehabilitation Hospital where she arrived at about 23:00 on 22 June. Because she arrived so late and out of core hours, she did not have the benefit of the full and usual assessments and she had also been waiting for the transfer for some significant time at the general hospital in its discharge lounge.  

The rehabilitation hospital nurse who examined Jean on her arrival noticed the wound site to be red and hot to touch and considered there was a possibility of infection and it was thereafter kept under visual observation. The following morning an advanced nurse practitioner requested routine blood samples be taken as part of the clinical assessment and the blood samples were taken the next day, 24 June, and were available for clinical review that afternoon but were not reviewed until the next day, 25 June, when raised inflammatory markers were noted and Jean was then transferred back to the general hospital (Royal Derby Hospital) due to infection.  

At the general hospital antibiotic treatment was started but Jean was not considered fit to undergo major surgery to remove the partial hip replacement and wash out the wound and end of life care was agreed with her family.  Although the court considered that there had been opportunity to refer Jean back to the general hospital earlier, on the evidence this would not have prevented her death, as even at that earlier point surgery would not have been appropriate due to the high risk of mortality given her comorbidities and frailty.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -
1.Jean had spent a lengthy period in the general hospital discharge lounge, during which time which she would not have had close checks and observations as compared to ward- based care. She did not arrive at the rehabilitation hospital until late at night and so did not have the usual core admission assessments. Such situations appear to me to have the potential to place patients such as Jean at significant risk. Given that there would usually be three parties involved in the transfer (the discharging hospital, the transporting ambulance service, and the discharge destination) there is opportunity for consideration of protocols to ensure such discharge arrangements are safe and appropriate.

2. Jean had signs of infection to the surgical site on arrival at the rehabilitation hospital and should have had more robust clinical review but confirmation of infection and referral back to the general hospital did not occur until her blood results were reviewed 3 days later. There had been opportunity to expedite the blood results. On the evidence at inquest there is reason to think that the rehabilitation staff were falsely reassured by a low NEWS score whereas there was suspected infection that could have been confirmed earlier.","On 05 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Alice Jean FOX aged 90.

He was released without an address to reside at, although an offer had been made by the custody sergeant for police officers to take him to his home address, where the victim lived, to collect his belongings and then take him to a place he could temporarily stay, such as a hotel. Whilst waiting for the officers to arrive to take him, Ivan left the Police station of his own accord and made his way to Portland, Dorset where he then attempted to take a motor vehicle as outlined in the circumstances above in section 4. During his time in police custody, it was identified by the custody sergeants that Ivan required a face to face assessment by the mental health practitioner. This did not happen. Further at approximately 09.00 hours on the 19th July he was seen to place an item around his neck which was interpreted by the custody sergeant as being an act of self-harm. At this time his risk of harm was assessed as low as his clothing had been replaced by rip stop clothing.

ii.When detained at the Police station it was not recorded anywhere on the custody record or associated Niche paperwork that this was Ivan's first time in police custody. There is no set question for this on the risk assessments within the custody log system held on Niche. In the College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice Guidance (APP guidance) on detention and custody risk assessment, the fact that it is the first time a person has been arrested or detained may indicate an increased risk. It is therefore important this is recorded somewhere. Other factors that appear in the list contained in the APP guidance which may increase the risk to a suspect were present with Ivan but were not highlighted or collated in the police records and which would assist with risk assessments.

Further in the Niche occurrence log when an entry is placed entitled ""Primary Investigation"" where there are 15 different sections to be completed, number 2 deals with the suspect. This does not however cover anything concerning the risk to the suspect themselves. There is no where other than on the custody risk assessment where officers managing the case can record the risks to the suspect themselves, unless they record this as a free type entry on the custody record or the Niche occurrence log.

Information gathering and collating can therefore be missed and key information around a suspect's risk may not be highlighted in a clear, easily accessible location. When a person is released from police custody, the investigating officer and the custody sergeant submit reports for the bail application to be considered by the duty Detective Inspector to approve. In this case, key information about Ivan's risk, such as the placing of the clothing around his neck, and unusual behaviour during the police interview, were not all collated and recorded in one place where all the information was easily accessible.

iii. In the APP Guidance on detention and custody risk assessment there is no specific guidance on what may fall into the category of low, medium or high risk when a person is being assessed by a custody sergeant. In comparison when grading a missing person there is more specific guidance in the current APP guidance on missing persons.

iv.There is no formal guidance given to custody sergeants or police officers as to what to do when a detainee has no place to reside upon release from police custody.

v.Upon his release from police custody, Ivan was given leaflets, such as the mental health safety netting advice leaflet detailing the mental health services he could access. These were given in English and placed with his property which was given to him upon his release from custody . They were not translated or explained to him. In Dorset these leaflets are now able to be produced in the lanquaqe of the detainee or in an understandable format for those who may have difficulties with reading, however this is likely to be a national problem.

vi. A number of emergency services and search and rescue services were involved in the events on the 19th July after Ian had tried to take the motor vehicle. These were Dorset Police, National Police Air Service (NPAS) His Majesty's Coastguard (HMCG) & the RNLI. The police radio was accessible by Dorset Police and NPAS as a channel of communication and HMCG and RNLI are able to communicate via VHF radio but there is no direct communication between all services, for example for NPAS and HMCG to directly communicate, they go via the police command centre. This can lead to a misunderstanding of what is going on, on the ground. In this case it was the belief of the NPAS Tactical Flight Operator (TFO), who was aware that there was a risk to Ivan's life from about 22.15 hours, and also the Force Incident Manager (FIM) in the police command centre, that a lifeboat had been launched, when in fact it had not. They therefore believed one was on route when it was not. If they had been aware that it was not on route this would have allowed for further communications or direct requests to be made between agencies, and other actions being taken. I was told in the evidence that there is work ongoing around an emergency services channel for communications, but this would not include search and rescue agencies and I have been told this is taking a considerable period of time to develop.

There appears to be from the evidence a lack of understanding between emergency services and search and rescue teams about the work each other undertakes, the language and terms they use, and the tasks they undertake.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. There is not sufficient clarity in the identifying, collating and recording of factors which may increase a person's risk on the Niche system that Dorset Police, and other forces nationally, use and as a result information could be missed which is vital to a person's risk assessment and their risk to themselves or others.

ii.There is not sufficient guidance given to custody sergeants on a national basis of how to assess a person's risk.

iii.There is no guidance, that I am aware of, which addresses what should be done by police forces, and particularly custody sergeants, when a person is to be released without an address to reside at and I would request consideration is given to such guidance being provided.

There is a lack of knowledge and/or understanding amongst emergency services and search and rescue services, especially around terminology, process and communication for them to be ensure they can work together when an incident arises without confusion or misunderstanding arising. I would request that consideration is given to further national and local training or guidance across emergency and search and rescue services to ensure communication can be facilitated without delay, and ensure terms and processes are understood to avoid any doubt of what action is being taken when an incident is ongoing.

v. Leaflets given to detainees when released from police custody are not always accessible due to language or literacy barriers and I would request that consideration is given nationally by NHS England and all Police Forces to ensure that any documentation detainees, especially any providing help and assistance, is accessible to them.","On the 11th August 2020, an investigation was commenced into the death of Ivan Rumenov Ignatov, born on the 10th February 1996.

She took her life by ligature suspension while under the influence of a very high blood alcohol level"". A narrative conclusion was given.

Brenda worked as a healthcare assistant in A&E at Cumberland Infirmary, she had for some time been alcohol dependent with binge sessions which often caused domestic friction with her husband, there was an incident of domestic violence requiring police involvement. Matters had been worse since she developed cauda Equina Syndrome which required neurosurgical intervention in 2021, and had ongoing low back pain which she tended to medicate with alcohol. She had had episodes of anxiety in 2005 & 2007, depression on 2016 & suicidal ideation in 2018. On 26/10/22 she was admitted to A&E in Carlisle (her own workplace) with an intentional overdose. She was followed up and treated by her GP. On 10/11/21 there was a serious incident when she was found by police on the riverbank, she had intended to enter the water but was talked down from this by her GP. Brenda was admitted to hospital [Hadrian unit] as a voluntary patient.

Brenda was not comfortable in the ward environment and on 14/11/21 discharged home to be followed up by the Crisis Team who did visit her at home the following day. Brenda's GP was not informed of her admission or discharge so was unaware of events until a prearranged telephone call on the 15th. Brenda was followed up at home and by telephone, at several contacts she was noted to be under the influence of alcohol. Brenda was discharged after a final ""MDT"" meeting on 6/12/22 [it is not clear who was involved], declining further input and denying any thoughts of self harm, a risk assessment on 8/12/22 records low or no apparent risks, this was the day Brenda died.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. [BRIEF SUMMARY OF MATTERS OF CONCERN]
(1) Brenda was discharged without any planned follow up. Her family were not involved in the discharge process despite assurances that they would be, her GP did not receive discharge notification from the Hadrian unit until 8 days after the event or from the Crisis team until 10 days after Brenda's death. Referrals promised from Hadrian unit to Drug/Alcohol services and Persistent Physical Symptoms Service were not made.

(2) Inadequate weight seems to have been given to Brenda's alcohol problems and her assurances that all was, and would continue to be well were accepted at face value despite her recent history, her family find it hard to understand how she could be graded low risk on the day she died.

(3) I refer you to the PFD report I issued referring to Charlotte Grace on 29/10/19. Assurances were given in response to that report which again focused on discharge without family/carer involvement which is surely paramount. I note actions mentioned in the incident report in this case but am still concerned that similar events may occur in future.","On 15 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Brenda SHIELDS age

The symptoms from this condition had led to a serious suicide attempt in February 2020. In 2021, following several months on the waiting list, Conrad received highly specialised therapy from the Centre for Anxiety Disorders and Trauma (CADAT). He made significant progress in managing his BDD symptoms during this therapy, however there was a known risk of relapse. He completed the sessions with his CADAT therapist in November 2021. Before and during this therapy, he had also received support from his local mental health trust's Peer Open Dialogue Team. As he had made such good progress with CADAT and as he had requested discharge from the Peer Open Dialogue Team, he was also discharged from this team in November 2021. There was no joint multi-disciplinary risk assessment and risk management plan on discharge from the teams. The practitioners were aware that Conrad was not taking a therapeutic dose of medication at the time of discharge, but no medical review was arranged for him. At the time of discharge from services, Conrad was also accessing treatment from an aesthetic dermatology clinic. This was not taken into account in his discharge risk assessment. Conrad had raised concerns with the skin clinic about his skin and the treatment, in December 2020; January 2021; March and April 2021. On the 27 and 28 February 2022, Conrad again raised concerns about the appearance of his skin, following treatment at the aesthetic dermatology clinic. His friends became concerned for his welfare when they could not reach him on the 2 March 2022. Emergency services attended and sadly Conrad was found deceased within his home address. The evidence at the inquest revealed that Conrad took his own life.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. A concern arose at the Inquest hearing in relation to the absence of liaison between the highly specialist services of the CADAT team and the stepdown services provided by NELFT. There was a lack of full information sharing around risk and joint risk assessment/risk management planning on discharge.

2. Both mental health services were aware that Conrad was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatment. There was a concern that neither service adequately highlighted the risks of accessing such treatment to Conrad or attempted to share information with the skin clinic. The inquest heard that patients with BDD should be fully informed of the risks of seeking aesthetic dermatology treatment and wherever possible, clinics who are providing treatment should be made aware of the BDD diagnosis.

3. The Inquest heard that there is a need for training to be provided to step-down service teams in relation to the diagnosis of BDD and the risks associated with it.

4. The inquest heard that there is a lack of national resources for BDD. The highly specialised service at South London and Maudsley has a very long waiting list (several months). This is on a background of concerns of a likely increase in BDD. In light of this concern, I am also providing this report to the Royal College of Psychiatrists, to the Department for Health & Social Care and to NHSE.","On 11 March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Conrad Richard James Colson, aged 34 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 18 May 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion:

Conrad Colson took his own life whilst suffering from severe body dysmorphic disorder. At the time of his death, he was accessing aesthetic dermatology treatments; he was not receiving a therapeutic level of medication and he was not in receipt of any professional mental health support for his body dysmorphic disorder. He had been discharged from mental health services without any robust risk assessment and without the safety net of a fully considered risk management/relapse plan.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 20 July 2023.

In October 2017, she made a complaint to police that she had been raped again. (Of note, her adoptive parents, to whom a copy of this letter is being sent, were not aware of either incident until after her death.) Her GP reported her life having been turned upside down. It was intended that a SOLO would be appointed after the initial report but, in evidence, it was established that did not happen until the end of October, a delay of approximately a month.  

Tamsin was assessed by Outlook South West. It was felt she presented with too much risk and she was discharged from their service with a referral to the CMHT. After assessment by them (three months after the incident) it was felt she did not meet the statutory threshold and she was not taken on to caseload. At the time, there was a process for reviewing patient cases who fell between the two organisations but this had not been done by the time of her death.

Tamsin was referred to the Women's Centre who conducted a needs assessment. She was advised there was a five-month wait for support.

On 8/1/18, Tamsin fell over 20' from a railway bridge in St Austell on to the railway lines. The fall was unwitnessed and as there was no evidence of her intent in the form of a letter, email, text or similar, I concluded the evidence did not further or fully disclose the means whereby the cause of death arose and so returned an Open Conclusion.

At inquest, I heard evidence from [REDACTED], general manager of Sexual Assault Referral Centre (SARC) of the importance of providing immediate care and support to rape survivors and the negative consequences that can occur where they feel their complaint is not being taken seriously, or there is a delay in the process. Tamsin's parents were of the view that, at the time she most needed support and assistance, she was largely left to fend for herself. I agreed with that view.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.

I was told additionally that there are over 20 vacancies for DCs to progress these complaints. One consequence was that it was taking over a month to achieve best evidence through video interview or otherwise.

Eifion Wyn Huws was aged 63 at the time of his death on 10 June 2022. He had a past medical history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma having had the diagnosis on 12 January 2022 and poorer mental health as a result. Other than the lymphoma he had no other significant past medical history. The anticipation of awaiting scans and treatment impacted severely upon his mental health but he had significant family support. Eifion was regularly reviewed by a GP and medicated accordingly. He had previous attempts at self-harm by way of medication overdose or self-inflicted injury. He had been under the care of the Community Mental Health Team including Home Treatment Team and primary care since early 2022 up to his death. His acts of self-harm were impulsive but serious. On 10 June 2022 Eifion had left his home address to attend his daughter's home across the road to let the cat out. There was a concern for Eifion when he did not reply to a text message from his wife around 15 mins later who then attended at their daughter's home and on opening the front door found Eifion suspended by a ligature [REDACTED]. Eifion was confirmed as having passed away at the property on 10 June 2022 at 10.37 by an attending paramedic.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1. a. During the Inquest evidence was heard that Eifion's GP had made a 'very
urgent' referral to the Single Point of Access and Allocation within BCUHB on 13 May 2022 indicating that on the background of attempts at ending his life, he was extremely concerned that Eifion was experiencing deterioration in his mental state. This document was contained within the hard copy set of notes held by the Psychiatric Liaison Team. When Eifion attended at the Emergency Department the following day, on 14 May 2022, the Emergency department staff were not aware of this 'very urgent' referral as they only had access to the electronic notes and not the hard copy notes. Had they been aware it is likely to have further informed their decision making. It is concerning that the process of ensuring electronic notes to allow for fully informed decisions around treatment and care based on all available records, is not available to staff. It was not clear at Inquest whether the transition from paper-based notes to electronic notes was a Health Board initiative or a nationally followed initiative. Either way, any delay in ensuring all notes are available electronically is potentially harmful to patients.

b. During the evidence it was accepted that 'a' above was not a consideration for improvement as part of the Health Board's investigation and so was not an action within the Action Plan upon which it could make improvements or plan to make improvements. It is surprising that the Health Board did not consider this as an issue which required further consideration and improvements in its learning and improvement.

An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into Eifion's death which appears to have been concluded in July 2022 but did not appear to be finalised and ready for sharing / disseminating until March 2023. I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations, specifically in relation to investigations from deaths in 2020 and 2021. Whilst I have previously been advised of improvements into investigation processes in respect of more recent deaths the issue of timeliness remains. Eifion died in 2022 and yet the time it took for the investigation to be completed and shared, with actions undertaken has been too long. I am concerned that deaths will occur when the actions arising are not acted upon in a timely manner.","On 21 June 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Eifion Wyn Huws (DOB 25/4/59) who died on 10 June 2022.

In summary, Amelia's mother had a routine pregnancy and was given a due date of 01 December 2020. She attended Peterborough City Hospital at around 1030 hours on 5 December 2020.

2.From very early on, the CTG trace was classified as suspicious on a number of occasions and on some occasions as pathological. Evidence and a report from HSIB confirms that assessment and decision making during this period was appropriate.

3.Due to a failure to progress in the second stage of labour and suspected fetal compromise at around 0240 hours, a decision was made for a Category 2 Caesarean section delivery.

The CTG trace was stopped at 0404 hours to enable the Caesarean to take place.

5.As had been anticipated, there was some difficulty due to Amelia's head being impacted, but the
Obstetrician and senior Midwife worked together and this was resolved within 4 minutes.

6.Due to difficulties siting a spinal anaesthetic, and Amelia's head being impacted, the time from decision to delivery was 83 minutes. Expert evidence confirmed that, on the balance of probabilities, Amelia suffered an acute hypoxic insult commencing around 10 minutes before her delivery and which was ongoing during resuscitation.

7.At delivery, no APGAR scores were recorded as they should have been. However, based upon the evidence in the notes, I accepted the hypothesis from HSIB that it is likely that her scores were 0 at 1 minute and 1 at 5 minutes.

8.The Midwife took cord blood gases but, as there was no blood in the clamped section of the cord, the blood was taken from a different part of the cord. I heard independent expert evidence from a Consultant Neonatologist that these are not likely to have been reliable as they were taken from close to the base of the placenta rather than the clamped section of cord.

9.The evidence of the Midwife at the inquest was that she felt, and she had since discussed this with colleagues who agreed, that if necessary it was fine to take blood from anywhere in the cord. Both the independent expert and the Trust's own Head of Midwifery, who gave evidence on changes made at the Trust in light of HSIB recommendations, agreed that blood should not be taken from anywhere other than the clamped section of cord. Further, if that was not possible, it must be clearly communicated to the Neonatal/Paediatric team.

10. There were a number of issues identified with the resuscitation and concerns raised by both HSIB and the independent expert, some of which were addressed by the Trust who produced evidence to confirm how these issues had been resolved.

11. However, other issues were identified. One such issue was that the independent expert advised that resuscitation attempts should not have stopped until all reversible causes had been considered and treated. Prior to resuscitation stopping, no blood transfusion had been given. Amelia had been described to be very pale. Her haemoglobin level was later found to be 94. Both the expert and HSIB felt a transf usion should have been given. The treating Registrar also gave evidence that, had he been aware of the issue with the cord blood and another issue relating to the condition of the placenta, he would have given a transfusion. The treating Consultant who gave evidence however disagreed.

12. One of the recommendations from HSIB was for there to be training and feedback to those involved in this case, and others who were not, to learn lessons.

13.There was also difficulty inserting an umbilical venous catheter, which I accept can be difficult even in experienced hands, and the delay in intra osseous access, which was contributed to by the lack of correct equipment on the resus trolley, led to a delay in Amelia receiving adrenaline, fluid volume and sodium bicarbonate. The expert recommended that staff undergo training to improve their skills for obtaining UVC and IO access.

14. While in NICU there was also a delay in Amelia being effectively cooled due to the active cooling machine not working. I was advised that this has now been replaced.

15. Amelia was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital where the extent of her injuries were confirmed
and she sadly died on 13 December 2020.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN ARE:
1.While I heard evidence that there has been training for Midwives on how to take cord blood, and I was provided with a copy of a poster that was said to have been in use at the Trust for some time, in April 2023, over 2 years after this delivery, the Midwife gave evidence that she and her colleagues were of the opinion that it was appropriate to take a sample from anywhere in the cord, not just in the clamped area. The expert and the Trust's own Head of Midwifery advised that this was not appropriate. It therefore does not appear that the learning has been passed on to all Trust Midwives and there is a risk that in future cases those treating the baby will be falsely reassured by normal cord pH results which may not be accurate.

While I read evidence of some training that had been provided in response to HSIB recommendations for further training on auscultation in addition to saturation monitoring and ECG monitoring during resuscitation, the independent expert also recommended training on UVC and IO access. I am also concerned that there does not appear to have been training in relation to the provision of blood transfusions in such cases to ensure that all potential reversible causes are treated before resuscitation stops. The Head of Midwifery who attended the inquest to advise on issues relating to the recommendations was not in a position to provide evidence on the neonatal position and I have been provided with no evidence by the Trust that these issues have been considered. I am concerned that they require further action.","On 14 October 2021 an investigation in to the death of Amelia Barbosa was commenced. Amelia died on 13 December 2020, aged 7 days.

The court found that rider error on the part of Kaius was the cause of the collision, contributed to by the faded road markings and a visibility issue at the collision location.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

'On 8.7.22 Nigel Harper, who had over the previous month been experiencing severe depression and anxiety, and living with thoughts of self-harm, took an intentional overdose of prescribed sedative and hypnotic medications. He was taken to Worcestershire Royal Hospital where, despite treatment, he continued to decline, and died on 23.7.22.""  

Mr. Harper lived in Scotland, but in the period leading up to his death had been staying with his sister near Malvern. He had a lengthy mental health history, which included a recent inpatient admission to a psychiatric hospital in Edinburgh.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty t report to you.  
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.   

(1) On 4 July 2022 Mr. Harper attended the Emergency Department at Gloucester Royal Hospital, and was seen by a nurse from the Mental Health Liaison team there, who recorded that he was very anxious and distressed, and voicing on going thoughts of suicide. The nurse felt that Mr. Harper would benefit from a period of treatment under the care of the Home Treatment Team, and because Mr. Harper was living in Worcestershire at the time, and because it was now in the early hours of the following day, he called the Worcestershire Crisis Team to arrange that. The nurse concerned was under the impression that by making this phone call, and passing on Mr. Harper's details to the Crisis Team, he was referring Mr. Harper's case to them. He told the inquest that he was expecting mental health services in Worcestershire to arrange a further urgent assessment of Mr. Harper, and he therefore ensured that Mr. Harper was told to expect the Crisis Team to contact him to arrange a further assessment.

(2) The Clinical Lead for the Crisis Team in Worcestershire gave evidence to the inquest that whilst the Crisis Team did receive a request from the nurse at Gloucester that night, they interpreted it only as a request for further assessment ( but not an urgent one ), and not as a request that Mr. Harper be referred to the Home Treatment Team.

(3) In the event, an urgent assessment was not arranged, and Mr. Harper's case was only considered by the Home Treatment Team in Worcestershire when his temporary GP in Worcestershire, out of further concern for Mr. Harper's mental health, made a new and separate referral to them.

(4) I have concluded that the events described above arose out of a lack of understanding between the two NHS Trusts concerned ( Herefordshire & Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( HWHCT ) and Gloucestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( GHCT ) ) as to how each other's mental health services are run - otherwise arrangements would have been made for Mr. Harper's mental health to be assessed urgently, as was intended.

(5) If staff at HWHCT and GHCT do not understand how to make urgent mental health referrals or requests for urgent mental health assessments to each other, there remains a risk that other deaths may occur in similar circumstances in the future.","[the details below are fictional]

the 7th March. He was granted 5 days overnight leave and should have
returned to the ward on the 11t March.

Carl's death:

Carl Thompson was found unresponsive in the bedroom of his house at
01:00 by his daughter on 10th March 2022. Ambulance staff attended at
01:39 and declared him deceased as a result of a drug overdose. Mr
Thompson had last been observed to be alive before 9:30pm on the
evening of 9th March 2022, when he was thought to be in a deep sleep,
observed by his daughter. Due to the post mortem condition of the
deceased upon being found, it is likely that he died on the night of 9th March 2022. Mr Thompson's death was probably contributed to by a failure of producing and regularly updating adequate risk assessments in relation to the planning of his section 17 leave and updating them following reported family concerns. In addition, it is possible that Carl's death was contributed to by a failure of both the hospital ward staff and the Community Mental Health Team.

On the evening of the 14th March 2022 she was taken by her family to Kingston Hospital and assessed by the liaison psychiatric team. She expressed suicidal thoughts and plans [REDACTED].

She was diagnosed with postpartum depression. She was advised to become an informal patient in the NHS but there was no bed available so she would have had to wait in the hospital until a bed could be found. She decided to seek a private admission the following day.

On the 15th March 2022 she sought treatment at the Priory Hospital, Woking. She had a preadmission assessment with [REDACTED] a consultant psychiatrist who accepted her as a patient. She told him that she had a suicide plan but did not provide details of what it was. He assessed her as a high risk of suicide and set observations at four times an hour. She was allocated a Key Worker who was not due to be in the hospital until 22nd March 2022, and a Co-worker, who had a one-to-one with her on 19th March 2022. Her overall mental health appeared to have improved when she was reviewed by [REDACTED] on March 18th 2022. The observation level
was reduced to twice an hour on the 16th March 2022, and then further to
once an hour on the morning of March 21st 2022, on each occasion without a risk assessment being performed as specified in the Priory policy.

Later on the morning of the 21st March 2022 Miss Henderson made comments during a therapy session which indicated that her mental health was deteriorating. The therapists recorded what she had said in her notes, but the concerns were not considered to be serious enough to be escalated to the nursing team. Evidence presented to the inquest suggests that Amy's observations should have been increased at this stage. Amy was not reviewed by the nursing team when the therapists' notes were uploaded onto the system at 16.06 on 21st March 2022. The information was not reviewed and therefore not acted upon.

Miss Henderson was last seen in person at 18.02 in the dining room. At
18.12. she entered the downstairs disabled toilet. The disabled toilet had been identified in risk assessments as a high-risk area but it was not locked. She wrote a farewell note to her parents at 18.14. She was found in the disabled toilet on the ground floor at 20.01. She had taken her own life by suspension, [REDACTED].","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. Inmy opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. The information that Miss Henderson had practised tying a ligature was divulged by her at Kingston Hospital but not repeated on admission to the Priory Woking. The evidence given at the inquest was that there is no quick method to obtain NHS records on admission to a private hospital. A request could have been made but the records would have taken over a week to be released. The records were not sought. An ability to obtain the NHS records quickly would have been of assistance to the Priory clinicians.

The Priory Woking has a policy in relation to the removal of banned and restricted items but there was a lack of clarity and confusion among the clinicians as to who was responsible for ensuring that such items are identified and removed from the patient at admission.","An inquest into the death of Miss Amy Henderson was opened on the 26th April 2022 and resumed with a jury on the 6th February 2023. The inquest was concluded on the 23rd February 2023. Evidence in respect of matters pertaining to this report was heard on the 20th March 2023.  

The jury concluded that Miss Henderson died on the 21st March 2022 at the Priory Hospital, Woking and the medical cause of her death was:  
1a Suspension  

They concluded with a narrative conclusion and found that:  
1. The Priory staff knew Amy had suicidal ideation, but they did not know any details concerning plans, or that she had practised tying a ligature.
2. No-one at the Priory asked her family about her suicide plans.
3. It is not possible to determine what Amy would have said to her consultant if she had been asked about suicide plans. Amy denied having any plans when asked by an HCA and she denied having thoughts of suicide in her 1:1 with a SHCA.
4. If Amy's mother had been asked, she would have shown the screen shots from Amy's phone and given details of Amy practising tying ligatures. Amy's mother has no recollection of volunteering the information.
5. Despite the notes from the therapy sessions being uploaded at 16.06, there was no formal request for Amy to be reviewed. There is evidence from professionals that Amy should have been reviewed urgently on the basis of the notes, if they had been scrutinised.
6. If information about Amy practising tying a ligature had been known, there would have been more consideration given [REDACTED] bearing in mind the balance of risk and least restrictive practice. 21st March. Amy was generally compliant with staff, [REDACTED].
7. After the identification of the disabled toilet as a high-risk area in 2021,
the ligature risk of the disabled toilet was not effectively managed although the Priory considered that it was.
8. Amy had unrestricted access to the disabled toilet, which was accessible to all patients, staff and visitors.
9. The Jury was not able to make a finding as to whether Amy was alive between 19.35 and 19.47.

In summary the following facts, on the balance of probabilities, made a material contribution to Amy Henderson's death:
a. Risk Assessments were not performed in line with Priory policy.
b. There was no Key Worker present throughout Amy's stay.
c. There were incomplete observations and little evidence of engagement with Amy during observations. Boxes were not ticked on Observation and Engagement Records.
d. The family was not consulted or questioned about Amy's Suicide Plans.
e. Therapy notes were not acted upon.
f. There was a lack of staff training in Postnatal depression.
g. There was a lack of continuity of care.
h. The disabled toilet was not locked.
i. Staff knowledge of the ligature footprint was inconsistent.

Amy committed suicide. She used a[REDACTED] ligature and intended to kill herself. She is shown on CCTV entering the disabled toilet and no-one else entered it until Amy's body was discovered.

On 6/5/22 he was referred to the urology department for the investigation of possible prostate cancer, when a decision was also made to consult a private Consultant Urologist. In order to relieve his symptoms of prostatitis and to make him ready for an investigative biopsy, he was prescribed Ciprofloxacin on 19/5/22 at a dose of[REDACTED]. 
He had no previous history of depression or mental health problems. 

Subsequently on the morning of 30/5/22 Mr Stevenson left his home address on his own for his usual walk. He had not previously given any indications to his family for them to be concerned for him. Thereafter at approximately 12.30pm his wife received a Facebook message from Mr Stevenson to indicate that he had left a note under the pillow of his bed.  

The note was found to be uncharacteristically confused and illogical given his reference to his baseless concerns that he may have developed AIDs after taking a HIV tester kit he had previously bought on line.  

Concerns were raised for his welfare, and this trigged an intensive police and family search of the surrounding area. Subsequently, Mr Stevenson was found hanging [REDACTED]. Upon the arrival of the paramedics, although resuscitative attempts were made, it was confirmed very sadly that he had passed away.","During the inquest I was referred by Mr Stevenson's treating urologist to published literature relating to Ciprofloxacin and Quinolone antibiotics and a potential rare link to suicide behaviour in patients, although I found on the balance of probabilities that it remained unclear that he was suffering from this side effect, it remained possible for this to be the case.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

• I heard evidence to suggest that the prescribing doctor did not reference this side effect at the time of issuing the prescription to Mr Stevenson, since it was not in accord with current advice.
• I also heard evidence to suggest that prescribing doctors may not be fully aware of this rare side effect, and that patient's suffering from depression may be more vulnerable to it.
I am therefore concerned that this potential risk has not been given sufficient emphasis and I would ask you to consider the appropriateness of reviewing the current guidelines as to the dispensation of the drug to patients by clinicians and increasing the awareness of the side effect in order to monitor and mitigate the risks.","On 22/06/22 I opened an inquest into the death of Robert Newton Stevenson who, at the date of his death was aged 63 years old. The inquest was resumed and concluded on 25/5/23.

She used an insulin pump to administer insulin and had done so since 2005.

ii)She had recently had a dental procedure and was also recently prescribed antibiotics for an infection. It was accepted by clinicians that this can cause a Type 1 diabetic to need more insulin than they would normally need.

iii) On the 3 December 2021, Sandra Diane Finches glucose levels start to rise. This is picked up by the pump that she used and this sounded regular alarms and gave correctional doses of insulin.

iv)On the 4 December 2021 Sandra Diane Finch called the West Midlands Ambulance Service and told them she was feeling more sleepy, her glucose was high and she had been vomiting. The categorisation of this call was category 3. This meant she was a medical emergency and required an ambulance. However, before an ambulance could be dispatched a clinical review Was required by the CV team.

v)The team was under staffed and had no time limit attached for an assessment. As such, an attempt for an assessment did not take place until
10 hours later.At 7:22 a call wasmadeto MissFinch. This was unanswered. The options available, at this stage, would have been to dispatch an ambulance, or to place the call back, back into the CV Teams work load. This was what happened.

vi)At 12:47 on the 5 December 2023 the decision was made by the team to categorise the ambulance request as a category 2 and dispatch an ambulance. This arrived at Sandra Diane Finches address at 13:08 and she was found to have passed away as a result of ketoacidosis.

vii)Clinical opinion disagreed that category three was the correct categorisation. It should be have been a category 2. Evidence was heard that the pathway had to be followed rigidly so a computer could decide the category, but accepted that a clinician listening to the answers may well have made a different decision and given the call a category 2 marking.

The view of clinicians was that had the ambulance been despatched within the accepted time limit for a category 3 ambulance, Sandra Diane Finch would not have died when she did.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 

1.That the pathways used by the service to categorise the level of ambulance and ridged and have no capacity for movement away from the path. This led to a type 1 diabetic patient, who was feeling sleepy and with deranged glucose levels, not being classed as a potentially serious situation requiring rapid intervention. Clinical opinion in agreement that this was, but the rigidly of the pathway meant it was categorised incorrectly.

That the use of an assessment team, to asses a category 3 ambulance call, with no time limit for assessments to take place, and no prioritisation system, will lead to further deaths resulting from delays.","On the 9th October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Ms Sandra Diane Finch.

On 6 April 2018 a recall notice was authorised by the National Offender Management Service and sent to the police to enforce.

The offender also wrote several letters to Angela Craddock from prison in breach of the Restraining Order.  Details of the Restraining Order were sent to HMP Altcourse and on receipt a paper copy of the conditions were placed in an envelope to be delivered to the Public Protection Department. This was never received so the relevant staff were not aware of the Restraining Order.

On 11 March 2020 the perpetrator was found to have committed Murder and sentenced under Section 38 Hospital Order with a Section 41 Restriction. 

I resumed the Inquest as there was sufficient reason to do so as the perpetrator had been involved with mental health services for an extensive period of time and was still open to services at the time of Odessa Carey's death.","During the course of the inquest evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless 'action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are, as follows: 

1. Multi-agency Risk Assessment Conference (""MARAC"") 
I heard evidence of issues of assault, violence and intimidation. Further that the consent of the individual reporting the concerns is not always required in order to complete a MARAC referral. 

Whilst I recognise that the extent of the issues could have been diminished out of familial ties or for other reasons, I am concerned that that staff did not explore the issues to a greater extent with the deceased, the wider family and other agencies. 

2. Assessment of substance misuse 
The service user had a history of substance misuse in particular cannabis and its impact on mental health was recognised. 

Whilst I acknowledge issues regarding service user consent and compliance, I am concerned there was no referral to substance misuse services for advice or assessment and treatment whilst an inpatient or in the community.

3.Inpatient discharge 30 May 2018
The discharge was not a coordinated discharge in line with the trust CPA policy. There was no discharge meeting, no involvement with other agencies or family, the service user was still mentally unwell, having delusional beliefs, without supported accommodation, vulnerable, moving to a new locality and without familial support

I am concerned there was a lack of opportunity to involve the family or other agencies in the discharge.

I am concerned that there was no direct contact or introduction to the service user from the care coordinator whilst an inpatient or before discharge to establish a relationship and trust.

4.Discharge from the Community Treatment Team on 6 August 2018
There was no pre-discharge meeting in line with trust CPA Policy involving the family, lead professionals, other agencies or a Consultant Psychiatrist for future planning.

A more assertive approach to engagement may have been appropriate.

I am concerned that following discharge from the Lowry ward to the community and prior to discharge from the community treatment team, the deceased was seen only four times in person by individuals from the mental health team and only once by the care coordinator.

I am concerned that more intense, in person engagement was warranted and discharge from the Community Treatment Team was premature.

I am concerned that the service user was not seen by a Consultant Psychiatrist at all after 30 May 2018 despite enquiring about a further appointment.

5. Appointment of a Care Coordinator
I heard that in line with the trust CPA policy paragraph 12.1 ""Consent must always be sought from a professional prior to them being identified as a Care
Coordinator. Under no circumstances must any professional be stated as Care Coordinator without negotiation and agreement. ""

I am concerned that consent and agreement was not obtained from a care coordinator prior to being identified for the role of care coordinator and concerns regarding capacity were not considered.

6. FACE Risk assessment tool
I am concerned that there continues to be an inconsistent approach to the assessment of risk. Various methods are still being deployed and there is a
possibility of a disparity in the understanding of the risk to the service user and others.

7. Record Keeping Documentation
I am concerned that entries in the RiO medical records were not made in line with Trust guidance in a timely, complete manner or at all.

I am concerned that evidence of clinical assessment, care planning and the reasoning behind clinical decision making were not recorded.

8.Contact with !RT and referral to Community Treatment Team
The service user contacted the service on a number of occasions and sought self-referral to the Crisis team on 19 September 2018 who assessed her as requiring a re-referral to the community team. No referral was made.

I am concerned that there was a delay in the referral to the Community Treatment Team and there is no audit system to ensure referrals are made and in a timely fashion.

Concerns were raised about fetal wellbeing, which prompted admission to hospital.  

The timeline of events includes two admissions to hospital over the course of the early morning of the 5 April 2021, after concerns were raised by the two midwives involved in these home attendances.  

On the second admission concerns were maintained about the fetal heart rate and Emilia was delivered by Caesarean section at approximately 7.22am but she sadly died, despite resuscitation attempts.","During the course of this inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN following the inquest into Emilia's death were as follows:  

I am concerned that the two midwives who attended Emilia's mother at home had limited experience of home births. One was a newly-qualified midwife who actually had more experience in home births than the other midwife; despite decades of midwifery experience she had never attended a home birth before.

I heard evidence that there is no specific regulatory requirement regarding midwifery experience at home births and that training to become a midwife requires attendance at 40 births of unspecified type. During the inquest it was set out that home births occur relatively infrequently and that it can be difficult to ensure involvement in such births during training.

I also heard that some midwives tend to focus on specific areas of practice, such as low-risk or high-risk births and that their experience in other areas can therefore be limited. This is despite the potential need for any midwife to attend low-risk births and the regulatory requirement that midwives ensure competency in all areas of practice.

I asked the hospital Trust involved for information as to how they ensure that midwives have appropriate experience in home birthing. They have set out as follows:

The lead midwife has previous experience (gained knowledge and skills through direct observation and participation) of attending and facilitating a home birth or birth in a low risk setting

The lead midwife normally works in a low risk birth setting i.e Community midwife or Bluebell birth centre midwife

The lead midwife is competent and up to date with their mandatory training within a home birth or low risk birth setting thus demonstrating the knowledge and skills required.

However, the concern remains that there is seemingly no specific regulatory requirement for training or ongoing exposure to areas of practice that midwives may encounter, in particular the unique issues that can arise during home births.",,,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 July 2023.

Whilst at the centre, she was incorrectly assessed as being a medium risk of falls, when in fact, she should have been categorised as a high risk. She therefore did not have the correct level of supervision. On 2nd October 2022, Carol was found on the floor of her room, having been previously sat in her chair by staff. The fall was unwitnessed. Carol sustained a further hip fracture as a result of this fall. She was returned to hospital where further surgical fixation was carried out successfully. Initially, she recovered well post operatively, however, Carol developed Pneumonia. She had a RESPECT form in place from her earlier admission and therefore her care was comfort care only. Her Pneumonia progressed to Sepsis, and she died on 23rd October 2022 in hospital.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1. Enhanced Supervision Levels training is not included on mandatory training programmes. Whilst some training sessions have been delivered by the trust to current staff members following this incident, I am concerned that new staff members joining will not be suitably trained in this area.

2.Falls risk assessment training is on the essential role training programme, however, I am concerned that this area is not covered suitably on induction of staff to the centre. This leaves a gap, particularly with agency staff, and I am not satisfied that with the current processes, agency staff will be fully versed on the completion of these risk assessments.

3. I was told that since this incident, falls risk assessments are being audited for compliance. I was also told that they are not being audited for correctness. I am therefore concerned that errors, and consequently, staff training needs, would not be picked up in these audits.","On 8 November 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Carol Ann CLEMENTS.

However, in the final month of his life, Patrick experienced a severe emotional deterioration. He engaged in repeated episodes of serious self-harm including cutting his arms, medication overdose and uncharacteristic excessive alcohol misuse. At one point, he briefly went missing when he travelled to Yorkshire - where he also self-harmed.

On 9 occasions during that final month, Patrick attended various hospital accident and emergency departments (in different NHS Trust areas), following incidents of self-harm. Some incidents also involved police contact. Patrick, however, declined to engage with psychiatric liaison services on these occasions and abruptly terminated a brief engagement with psychiatric assessment services following referral. Patrick had mental capacity to refuse treatment.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1. 5 NHS Trusts and 3 police forces in different geographic areas had contact with Patrick in the final month of his life and each thereby gained some information about the risk to him. However, that information was by reason of the agencies falling into different geographic areas. There was no single effective global focus for the information being acquired piecemeal about Patrick's pattern of serious self-harming behaviour. The various agencies were significantly impeded in forming a single clear picture of Patrick's pattern of behaviour (which was particularly necessary in circumstances where he was not engaging and therefore not assisting in providing a complete history himself).

2. GPs act as a repository for information about contact with other clinical agencies (such as attendances at accident and emergency departments) and therefore serve as a point of contact for information about past history. However, I heard evidence at inquest from accident and emergency consultants that it is either not possible to access information held by a GP practice out of GP surgery hours or where it is possible to do so that is only available if the GP is in the same
geographic area as the accident and emergency department. Several of

Patrick's attendances at accident and emergency departments were out of GP surgery hours.

3. I was informed at inquest that one local authority (in whose area Patrick resided) had been made aware by police of the risk to Patrick following one of his self- harm incidents (in respect of a particularly important piece of information) and had relayed that information to a 6th NHS Trust (not one of the 5 from which I heard evidence at inquest) but Patrick did not reside in that Trust area. Those Trusts which did have direct contact with Patrick were never made aware of that piece of information nor had any means of accessing it.

4. I heard evidence that there is no national 'risk flagging' system: for example, when a person attends an accident and emergency department having self- harmed, the fact of a previous self-harm attendance at a different accident and emergency department is not systematically flagged up.

5. In summary, there was no single effective global focus consolidating the information which was flowing into the various agencies about Patrick; no global focus to which those agencies could in turn refer in emergency to obtain the totality of information about Patrick's recent pattern of behaviour; no national 'risk flagging' system to alert those agencies to his significant recent history.","On 6th July 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Patrick Soames, who was 24 years old when he died on 21st June 2021.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

This inquest highlighted the significant numbers of prisoners who enter the prison system with known or undiagnosed mental health issues. Whilst ACCT 6 requires multidisciplinary attendance at review meetings, this case highlighted the need for specific attendance of an RMN or other mental health expert at any review, (Mr Robinson had repeatedly self harmed prior to committing suicide but had presented without concern at each review which had been carried out without any input from the mental health team). The prison in question now operates a local policy to ensure someone from the mental health team attends all ACCT reviews irrespective of other disciplines attending. This has enabled the prison to identify issues which may not be picked up by other professionals involved, to enable support to be put in place by way of separate care plans which has had a notable impact upon SASH in the prison.","On 05 May 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stuart Michael ROBINSON aged 20. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 15 May 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:  

Stuart Michael Robinson arrived at HMP Altcourse on 3rd March 2021 after receiving a 26 week sentence for breach of license. He was due to be released on 1st June 2021. He arrived with a history of attempted suicide and self-harm. 

On the 8th April, a ACCT book was opened following the interception of a letter detailing Mr Robinson's intention of suicide. Subsequently he was put under a regime of 5 observations an hour and 2 meaningful conversations per day. 

On the 9th April he underwent a mental health assessment and the first ACCT case review reduced the number of hourly observations to 3, with the number of meaningful conversations remaining at 2 per day. A care plan was put in place as part of this first case review. 

On the 14th April at a second case review, the observations were removed entirely, however the meaningful conversations remained at 2 per day. 

On the evening of 18th April Mr Robinson self-harmed, leading to hourly observations being reinstated. This led to the 3rd case review being brought forward to the 19th April. Hourly checks were once again removed and Mr Robinson continued to have 2 meaningful conversations. 

On 23rd April Mr Robinson self-harmed again, leading to the fourth case review being brought forward. On this same date Mr Robinson's podmate was released from prison and Mr Robinson was therefore alone in his cell. 

Mr Robinson was last seen at 7 pm on the 24th April. In the early hours of 25th April between approximately 12 am and 1 am, Mr Robinson applied a ligature [REDACTED] ultimately resulting in his death by suicide. 

His body was discovered at 5am and a code blue was called. Medical staff attended the scene but it was clear that Mr Robinson was incapable of resuscitation.

CORONER'S CONCERNS 

During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The vehicle involved in the collision failed to negotiate the left hand band on the westbound Old Oundle Road at Wittering adjacent to the rear crash gates of RAF Wittering. The vehicle left the road to its offside and entered a pond where it became submerged in water. The 2 occupants of the vehicle drowned as a result.

There is sharp route deviation signage for vehicles travelling in the opposite direction but nothing to alert westbound drivers of the sharp left hand bend. The water beyond the bend clearly creates an additional hazard.

Whilst the precise reason the vehicle failed to negotiate the left hand bend on this occasion is unclear I am concerned that the lack of signage alerting westbound traffic of the bend at this location creates a risk of future incidents and death, not least because of the water beyond.","On 03.09.22 I commenced an investigation into the death of Milan Peter HAMZA (Otherwise known as Milan Peter RADOCZ), aged 8 years.

Medical Cause of Death  
1 (a) Multiple organ failure 
(b) Mixed drug overdose  
11 Depressive illness, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Ischaemic heart disease, Hypertension, Frailty.

How, when, where the deceased came by her death:
Mrs Leaver was admitted to St George's Hospital, (SGH) on 15th August 2020 suffering
with phenytoin toxicity. She had an extensive psychiatric history recently complicated by
overdose and suicidality. This was not recognised by the clinical team despite evidence
available in the electronic records, concerns raised by the family and intermittent agitation.

She was deemed to have reduced mental capacity between 16th August 2020 and her
discharge for rehabilitation to Queen Mary's Hospital (QMH) on 18th August 2020, but
her bag was not searched.
[REDACTED]

On transfer to QMH, she was found to have capacity and again refused a bag search.
Overnight on 19th August 2020, she expressed suicidality to her family who notified
nursing staff at QMH.

On 20th August 2020, this suicidality was explored by the SHO who found her not to be
actively suicidal and sought no advice from the psychiatric liaison service.

On 22nd August 2020, whilst collateral psychiatric history was being sought after she
threatened self-discharge, at approximately 15:00 she took an overdose [REDACTED]

Mrs Leaver was readmitted to SGH and died there on ITU at 16:37 23rd August 2020 as
a result of the overdose.

The failures in care and communication together constitute a ""total picture"" that amounts
to neglect.

Mrs Leaver took her own life whilst suffering from depressive illness. Her death
was contributed to by neglect.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

1. The evidence heard during the course of the inquest highlighted an inconsistency between the literature provided by the manufacturer of sertraline (the patient information leaflet ('PIL')) and the British National Formulary ('BNF') produced by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society (latest version: BNF 85, March 2023).

2. The PIL contains a list of ""uncommon"" side effect of suicidal behaviour, which includes the following in bold: ""Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during sertraline therapy or early after treatment discontinuation (see section 2).""

3. The BNF relating to Depression (3.4, p395) and the use of Antidepressant Drugs states under the heading ""Suicidal depression and antidepressant therapy"" (p397): ""The use of antidepressants has been linked with suicidal thoughts and behaviour; children young adults and patients with a history of suicidal behaviour and particularly suicidal behaviour are particularly at risk. Where necessary patients should be monitored for suicidal behaviour, self-harm or hostility, particularly at the beginning of treatment or if the dose is changed.""

4. The section of the BNF relating to SSRIs (p401) also identifies ""suicidal behaviours""
as a potential uncommon side-effect.

5. However, the section with respect to sertraline does not specifically identify suicidal tendencies at all, although it does identify ""thinking abnormal"" as an uncommon side effect (p.405).

6. I am concerned that there is a risk that a medical practitioner consulting the BNF with a view to determining dosage and treatment with Sertraline will be unaware of the potential risk of the onset of suicidal behaviour and/or would not consider it necessary to discuss that risk with the patient. The evidence heard at the inquest suggested that it would not be appropriate or practical for GPs to consider PILs before prescribing.

On the other hand, the PIL and BNF are intended for different purposes. It may be that the evidence of risk of suicidal ideation associated with Sertraline specifically (as opposed to SSRIs) is so low that it need not be referred to in the BNF, notwithstanding its inclusion in the PIL. Nevertheless, this is a matter of concern that would in my view benefit from further consideration.","On 18 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joshua Fynn ASPREY aged 19.

(1) I am advised that an appropriate Triage System is not always adopted in practice at Accident and Emergency.

(2) Without the adoption of a Triage System taking place escalation of care cannot meaningfully take place.

(5) Communication with the next of kin appears not to have occurred in a timely fashion.

Evidence given at the Inquest identified:
The Ambulance crew pre-alerted A and E, but the patient was not triaged using the Manchester Triage System, resulting in missed opportunities to identify the patient's clinical priority . There was subsequently inadequate monitoring.

The degree of timely candour with the family is unclear and clarification is required in this regard.

Due to his underlying health, he was treated with radiotherapy- other treatments were not felt to be suitable. He developed an oesophageal stricture as a consequence of the radiotherapy treatment. Dilatation procedure did not lead to an improvement. A biodegradable stent was inserted to try to improve the position. He was in significant pain as a consequence of the stent. Pain is a recognised complication of stenting in these circumstances. He was admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital on 13th September 2021 following episodes of bleeding. A gastroscopy on 14th September 2021 confirmed that the bleeding was from the oesophagus - from an aorta/oesophageal fistula. On the balance of probabilities, the stent had contributed to the development of the fistula. Raymond Douglas Lee continued to deteriorate and died at Stepping Hill Hospital on 14th September 2021.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The inquest heard evidence that oesophageal strictures are a recognised complication of radiotherapy for oesophageal cancers. The implications of them are significant for patients as they can lead to aspiration and as well as significantly impact quality of life. At this time there is only very limited national guidance on how to best treat patients with strictures and limited evidence on which to develop best practice. The evidence given was that careful dilatation by an experienced practitioner was the best approach initially. However, dilatation particularly repeated dilatation carried risk of perforation and needed to be seen as something that could not be continued indefinitely. However, there was limited evidence on what the optimum number of dilatations were and/or when to stop and move to consider stenting.

The inquest heard that stenting of patients in these circumstances has a limited body of evidence regarding the risk. The inquest highlighted that perforation may be a risk in some cases where a stent is used and that needed to be factored into any decision to use a stent.","On 16th September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Raymond Lee. The investigation concluded on the 19th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from complications of treatment for oesophageal cancer and a subsequent oesophageal stricture. 

The medical cause of death was

In December 2021, she was offered staged bilateral knee replacements. She was assessed by[REDACTED] as being at high risk of developing a DVT.  She had a nurse-led pre-op assessment on 26/1/22 when, I am told, a further risk assessment was not done, in accordance with policy at the time.  

On 2/3/22, she had a right total knee replacement. She was discharged on 5/3/22 and died at home on 28/3/22. 
At post-mortem, her cause of death was found to be: 
1a) Pulmonary embolus 
1b) Deep vein thrombosis 
II) Immobility following right knee replacement","During the course of the investigation, my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - I enclose the bundle of evidence.
At pp A32-A54, you will find what I am told is the Trust's Guideline Summary for Thrombosis Prevention and Anticoagulation. At p42, following elective knee replacement, it is suggested clinicians may choose any one of
Aspirin[REDACTED] for 14 days
LMWH for 14 days and anti-embolism stockings 
Rivaroxaban[REDACTED] once daily for 14 days

As matters of fact, I am told Mrs Hancock was prescribed 14 days of aspirin and, in apparent error, one unidentified doctor also prescribed Dalteparin which was stopped after a single dose. It is of concern that the doctor cannot be identified and I have no record of the decision-making.

At C32, you will find the Trust's full guidance for drug prophylaxis following elective knee replacement which is taken from its Thrombosis Prevention and Anticoagulation Policy v9.0 dated Feb 2022. It provides:

Low risk - Aspirin[REDACTED] daily for 14 days
High Risk - Rivaroxaban[REDACTED] daily for 14 days or
Dalteparin or Enoxaparin for 28 days plus stockings (until discharge.)

[REDACTED] had not seen the full guidance previously despite it having been published for over a year which, as a consultant orthopaedic surgeon, is of concern in itself.

[REDACTED] further said that Mrs Hancock was high risk yet she appears to have been given prophylaxis for a low risk patient because the summary guidelines appear not to reflect accurately the full guidance.

[REDACTED], as I understood [REDACTED], said that it had been[REDACTED] practice to prescribe aspirin to all high-risk patients since (at least) February 2022. This raises the question of whether other patients have died from a PE or DVT because of wrongly prescribed prophylaxis that have not been reported to this Office. You will need to consider the position.

I have only considered the situation as it came before me, namely, for an elective knee replacement. As I understand the anticoagulation policy will have a much wider reach than that there is an obvious need to consider the implications across all the Trust's services.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 13/7/23.

On the 17 January 2022 he attended A&E where he underwent blood tests, chest Xray and medical reviews. The impression at this time was that he was suffering from community acquired pneumonia. He received a dose of intravenous antibiotics and intravenous fluids and was discharged from hospital with a course of oral antibiotics. Akash attended for a follow-up chest Xray on the 28 February 2022. This Xray showed progression in his left lung consolidation and showed a new consolidation in his right lung. The inquest heard that the primary diagnosis based on this Xray should have been tuberculosis. On the 4 March 2022, an emergency ambulance was called when Akash was found to be coughing and vomiting blood. Paramedics attended and provided emergency assistance. They could not however resuscitate Akash and his life was pronounced extinct by a paramedic. A post-mortem examination revealed a pulmonary abscess which was most likely to have been caused by tuberculosis. There is no evidence that any acts or omissions in the care provided to him, contributed to his death. The chest radiograph was not sent for analysis until 8 March 2022. The lack of an alert did not therefore contribute to Akash's death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

The Xray on the 28 February 2022, which was carried out following treatment for pneumonia, showed an obvious progression in lung consolidation and was highly suggestive of tuberculosis (a new clinical diagnosis). Akash was not an in-patient in hospital at the time of the follow-up Xray. He had been discharged and was therefore not under the active management of a clinical team. The inquest heard that such significant, unexpected, and important changes should have been highlighted to the referring clinician. This was not done. There does not appear to be a process in place for an alert to be added to the normal communication method to ensure that such significant, unexpected, and important findings are acted upon in a timely manner.

The inquest also heard that the incidence of TB is rising in certain areas of the UK and that it is important that radiologists recognise TB changes and that these are duly highlighted to the referrer.","On the 30 May 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Akash Dinesh Bhudia, age 28 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 16 May 2023. 

The conclusion was that Mr Bhudia died as a result of natural causes. 

The inquest however heard evidence in relation to non-causal concerns in relation to the reporting of chest radiographs.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 14 July 2023.

By March 2022, Mr Mason was becoming more frail and, owing to mobility issues, was suffering from recurrent falls. Mr Mason fell in his bedroom on the evening of 5 March 2022. An ambulance was called but it took a number of hours until paramedics arrived and transported Mr Mason to hospital. Once there, Mr Mason was diagnosed with a fractured hip, as a result of the trauma suffered when he fell.

Mr Mason did not present as acutely medically unwell (as opposed to him having an obvious requirement for trauma assessment, followed by surgery) at any time after the fall or whilst in hospital and no clinician involved in his care appreciated that, without additional steroid medication, he was at high risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis, owing to his primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease) and the trauma and physiological stress that he had suffered following the fall. In the early hours of 7 March 2022, whilst in a bed on a surgical trauma ward, Mr Mason was found breathing abnormally and was obviously acutely unwell. Mr Mason went into cardiac arrest shortly after and died. Mr Mason had suffered an acute adrenal crisis, which was the cause of his sudden and unexpected deterioration and death.

Following medical evidence heard at the inquest, the cause of death was determined as:

1a - acute adrenal crisis (on a background of a known diagnosis of Addison's disease) 1b - fractured neck of femur following a fall
2 - frailty

Box 3 of the Record of Inquest (which answered how, when and where Mr Mason came by his death) was determined as:

'David Mason had been unwell for a number of years, including suffering from primary steroid insuffiency (Addison's Disease), a condition which required the administration of replacement steroid medication. Owing to significant frailty, David had fallen over at home in the evening of 5 March 2022, suffering a fractured hip (diagnosed in hospital on 6 May 2022, following x-ray). An ambulance was not available for a number of hours owing to demand and resource factors, however paramedics attended on David at home and conveyed him to hospital early in the morning on 6 March 2022. No required additional steroid replacement therapy was administered to David by paramedics. In hospital, no required additional steroid replacement therapy was administered to David by clinicians over a period of approximately 19 hours, which led to David's sudden deterioration and death in the early hours of 7 March 2022 at the Worcestershire Royal Hospital.'","During the course of the investigation and inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows (numbered separately in respect of each organisation, who are required to respond to each of the numbered paragraphs relating to them):

Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust (WAHT)
1) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing care to Mr Mason (in both the emergency department and the surgical trauma department) appreciated that, as someone who had Addison's disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.

2) The relevant internal Trust guideline disclosed by WAHT ('Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults') very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure-based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing 'sick day' rules, which are on the same page as advice to patients and families for long-term condition management) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.

3) Evidence heard at the inquest (relating to the trauma/surgical department at WAHT) suggested that it is likely that many clinicians (including at consultant level) do not have a well-developed understanding of adrenal insufficiency and the crucial importance of administering replacement steroid therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of suffering an adrenal crisis.

4) Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that no prompts exist on emergency department/clerking documentation at WAHT for clinicians to check whether a patient suffers
from adrenal insufficiency. Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included.

West Midlands Ambulance Service University NHS Foundation Trust (WMAS)
1) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that no clinician involved in providing pre-hospital care to Mr Mason appreciated that, as someone who had Addison's disease and who had suffered the trauma of a fall, long lie and a fractured hip, Mr Mason required additional replacement steroid therapy, to prevent the development of an acute adrenal crisis.

2) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison's disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical steroid treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. Currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not being considered by call-handlers at WMAS.

3) The Serious Incident investigation report disclosed by WMAS did not make any recommendations in respect of improving clinicians' knowledge of adrenal insufficiency and the importance of considering administering replacement steroid therapy.

4) Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the investigation lead at WMAS had not been shown the inquest disclosure bundle, which had been disclosed to the legal department at WMAS a number of months prior to the inquest. This bundle contained relevant evidence from a different internal investigation (by WAHT), suggesting that the likely cause of Mr Mason's deterioration and death was an acute adrenal crisis and not, as had been considered when a coronial referral had initially been made, hyperkalaemia and rhabdomyolysis (following a fall and long lie). This lack of internal co-ordination within WMAS prevented full internal investigation and learning in respect of the care given to Mr Mason by WMAS. The legal department of WMAS did not attend the inquest (it was their right not to) nor were WMAS legally represented by an external solicitor or barrister (it was their right not to be). Greater engagement and participation in the coronial investigation and inquest process would improve the Trust's ability to learn from patient-safety incidents and enable the legal, governance and safety departments to better co-ordinate such investigations.

Association of Ambulance Chief Executives (AACE)
1) The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) places very little emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis, owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the 'administer hydrocortisone' box) is itself a sub-section of an 'emergencies in adults and children' box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are 'unwell' require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis - it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered 'unwell' in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro- intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress.

2) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison's disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical medical treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival). Safety- netting advice takes on even greater significance in the current climate, where healthcare demand and pressures on capacity are often causing severe delays in ambulance attendance. Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that the position is different if information is given that the patient is medically unwell, particularly if concerns of a cardiac nature are present or adrenal insufficiency may be the direct cause of current illness, with the call-handler question pathway then going on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency. The pathway and programmed- logarithm should be looked at, as currently there is a cohort of patients (which included Mr Mason) whose risk of developing an adrenal crisis is not able to be considered by ambulance service control centres.

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
1) The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT ('Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults') very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing 'sick day' rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. It is my understanding that a new guideline in respect of managing the treatment of adrenal insufficiency is currently being developed by NICE. Consideration of these matters should be included as part of guideline development.

Society for Endocrinology (Clinical Committee)
1) The relevant treatment guideline disclosed by WAHT ('Guideline for the management of adrenal insufficiency in adults') very much focuses on presentations of acute adrenal crisis and procedure- based/perioperative situations, and (save for a small section containing 'sick day' rules) does not emphasise that replacement steroid therapy must be given to patients with adrenal insufficiency who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. Evidence heard at the inquest suggested that this internal Trust guideline (and, one assumes, other such guidelines in other acute trusts in the country) is based upon various pieces of national guidance. The clinical committee of the Society for Endocrinology has previously been involved in providing guidance in respect of managing patients with adrenal insufficiency. The Society's input going forward is important in respect of considering any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.

2) The relevant JRCALC (Joint Royal Colleges Ambulance Liaison Committee) guideline for steroid dependent patients (which was disclosed by WMAS as part of inquest proceedings) place very
little emphasis on the importance of administering steroid replacement therapy to patients who, although not presenting as acutely unwell, are at risk of developing an acute adrenal crisis owing to them suffering from trauma or physiological stress. The relevant section (contained in bullet point 2 of the 'administer hydrocortisone' box) is itself a sub-section of an 'emergencies in adults and children' box and therefore is not able to be easily differentiated from treatment required for patients who are already established as being in an emergency situation. Further, it is stated that patients who are 'unwell' require hydrocortisone to prevent an adrenal crisis - it is not sufficiently clear that patients who may have suffered trauma or physiological stress also require steroid treatment, to prevent an adrenal crisis. To lend weight to this latter concern, evidence heard at the inquest suggested that some of the clinicians involved in treating Mr Mason considered 'unwell' in this context to mean obviously medically unwell, such as having signs of infection or sepsis, or gastro-intestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea. There was no evidence of any understanding that this definition encompasses patients who have suffered trauma or physiological stress. The Society's input going forward is important in respect of considering any future NICE or JRCALC guidelines regarding the management of adrenal insufficiency.

NHS England
1) Evidence heard at the inquest demonstrated that when information is given to an EOC (emergency operations centre) call-handler at WMAS that a patient has a diagnosis of Addison's disease and has suffered trauma, the call-handler question pathway (which, the inquest heard, is based on a computer-programmed logarithm (designed by NHS Digital, now part of NHS England)) does not go on to consider the risk of adrenal insufficiency and the requirement for replacement steroid therapy to commence immediately. This appears to be potentially relevant both in respect of whether time-critical medical treatment may be required (and thus for a holistic consideration of call categorisation) and safety-netting advice that should be given (for additional doses of steroid medication to be taken by the patient, prior to any ambulance arrival).

2) Evidence heard at the inquest confirmed that no prompts exist on emergency department/clerking documentation at WAHT for clinicians to check whether a patient suffers from adrenal insufficiency. Although the inquest was informed that changes have been made in this regard by WAHT to some peri-operative patient documentation, the National Patient Safety Alert (NatPSA/2020/005/NHSPS) requires acute trusts to review admission/assessment/clerking documentation to ensure such prompts are included. It is not clear what follow-up action is taken by NHS England in relation to monitoring of compliance by NHS Trusts following National Patient Safety Alerts being issued.","On 13 March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of David Ernest Mason.

In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTER OF CONCERN - 1. Chief Medical Officer for England Department of Health
The respiratory paediatrician who gave evidence at inquest was firmly of the view that generic adrenaline auto-injectors should be available, in much the same way as defibrillators, in public spaces.
Is this a suggestion that could be given wider consideration?

The MATTER OF CONCERN - 2. Chief Executive, London Ambulance Service NHS Trust
1.While staff at Nasar's school were waiting for an ambulance, they asked for advice from the call operator about whether to administer his EpiPen. They were put through to a paramedic, who advised not to use it, I think because the classic signs of anaphylaxis were not obvious.

However, the firm view expressed to me at inquest by Nasser's respiratory paediatrician was that, if a person has an adrenaline auto-injector and:
- has any respiratory compromise, or
- there is a loss of consciousness, or
- if there is doubt,
then the correct and potentially lifesaving course of action, regardless of the particular constellation of signs and symptoms, is to use the EpiPen and to use it immediately.

He explained that any harm caused by giving intra muscular adrenaline from an auto-injector in this situation is likely to be minimal, even if it proves not to have been needed, whereas the good if it is needed is potentially lifesaving.

The MATTER OF CONCERN - 3. Royal London Hospital, Bromley by Bow Health Centre and British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology 

1.The picture presented by Nasar to his respiratory paediatrician did not accord, the consultant discovered at inquest, with that given to Nasar's general practitioner.

Nasar reported to his consultant that he was experiencing few symptoms, and he did extremely well in his last lung function test. Yet his GP found Nasar's asthma control score to be 14 out of 25, which is poor; and his GP was prescribing 30 inhalers a year, the necessity for which is well recognised as being a risk factor for death.

Nasar should have seen his consultant again. There must be a way of identifying a child in his position. For instance, could there be an automatic flag raised if excess medication is prescribed?

2. The asthma pump in Nasar's medication box at school was an Accuhaler, which I heard from his respiratory consultant is inappropriate for an emergency situation such as this, and would not have assisted him. Moreover, the appropriate inhaler should have been accompanied by a spacer for best administration.

I wonder whether there is a widespread lack of understanding of the best treatment in this situation?

3. The school nurse had updated Nasar's care plan by using the allergy action plan (mild-moderate with asthma) instead of the correct one used the year before, the allergy action plan (severe with asthma). This meant that Nasar's medication box contained an EpiPen without any description of when or how to use it.

There must be a way of ensuring that the care plan is accurate and up to date, and that there are identical copies stored at home, school, the GP surgery and within the hospital records.

4. Even if the correct action plan had been used, it does not give the instruction that if a person has an adrenaline auto-injector and:
- has any respiratory compromise, or
- there is a loss of consciousness, or
- if there is doubt,
then the correct and potentially lifesaving course of action, regardless of the particular constellation of signs and symptoms, is to use the EpiPen and to use it immediately.

This was the very firm view of Nasar's respiratory consultant. Is there a way of disseminating this advice more widely?

The MATTER OF CONCERN - 4. Bow School
1.Although Nasar's mother was present for Nasar's medication review conducted by the school nurse, there was no school representative such as the year learning manager there for the meeting, contrary to school policy.

2.The school nurse identified Nasar's medication as being out of date, and asked that in-date medication be provided, but there was no robust system for ensuring that he was booked in for further review when this was provided.

3.Although all staff at the Bow School were encouraged to familiarise themselves with pupils' care plans, they often did not unless there was a school excursion. The internal exclusion room (IER) supervisor had not done this for the pupils in the IER. Even the deputy headteacher, who had in the past taught Nasar, did not know about Nasar's food allergies or the fact that he had a care plan and allergy action plan when he placed Nasar in the IER.

4.Not everyone involved in trying to help Nasar was first aid trained, most notably not the learning assistant who was supervising the IER. She said that she would not have thought of looking for and retrieving his care plan.

5.Even those members of staff who were first aid trained it seemed might benefit from additional and/or more frequent training. One member of staff did not share with others the fact that Nasar had asked for this asthma pump. Another looked at his individual healthcare plan, but could not remember looking at the allergy action plan.

6.One member of staff forgot Nasar's name. It is of course not possible for members of staff to remember the names of all pupils, but perhaps typed forms accompanied by a photograph might help?

Although not followed in this instance, I heard that the school policy dictates that the headteacher's personal assistant should be contacted to telephone the emergency services. Such a stipulation would surely be guaranteed to add delay.

The MATTER OF CONCERN - 5. Compass Wellbeing Tower Hamlets Steel's Lane Health Centre
1.When the school nurse (employed by Compass Wellbeing) conducted a review of Nasar's medication in May 2016, he did not have the medication stored in school in front of him at the time, but relied on its description by a school receptionist.

2.Although Nasar's mother was present for the review, there was no school representative, such as the year learning manager (head of year), there for the meeting.

3.The school nurse then updated the care plan by using the allergy action plan (mild-moderate with asthma) instead of the correct one used the year before allergy action plan (severe with asthma). This meant that Nasar's medication box contained an EpiPen without any description of when or how to use it.

4.He identified the medication as being out of date, and asked that in-date medication be provided, but did not diary forward to the following week to ensure that current medication was now in the box. This meant that he also did not complete the action plan with the dose of the relevant medication.

These points raise issues about the actions of this particular nurse and potentially of other nurses in this role in other schools.","On 17 November 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nasar Ahmed, aged 14 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest today. I made a narrative determination, which I attach.

On the 9th March 2022, Natalie was shopping on her own in a supermarket and was queued at the tills to pay for her groceries. Whilst she was waiting to be served, another shopper on a mobility scooter has joined the queue and was waiting, stationary.

Without warning the mobility scooter accelerated forward, ploughing into Natalie with some force and knocking her over. The forward propulsion of the mobility scooter was a conscious act of the driver/rider rather than an unforeseen mechanical or electrical fault.

On becoming aware of the injury caused to Natalie, the mobility scooter driver flees the scene and has not been identified or heard from since.

An ambulance was called but declined to attend and so staff from the supermarket transport Natalie to Musgrove Park Hospital where, on admission, it is discovered that she has sustained a fractured hummerus. Whilst she was medically fit for discharge throughout the duration of her stay in hospital, she required physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessments as part of her discharge planning. Natalie was ultimately discharged from hospital on the 9th April 2022 with a package of care in place.

Natalie suffered from immobility as a result of the injury, as well as severe pain.

She was re-admitted back into hospital on the 13th April 2022 when she was diagnosed with severe sepsis and an acute kidney injury due to a lower respiratory tract infection which had arisen solely as a consequence of the injuries she had sustained, and the resultant immobility, following a fall. Natalie died on the same day.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed that in relation to mobility scooters there are:

1. No restrictions on those who are able to operate them; i.e. there are no requirements on the drivers to have vision to a certain standard; to evidence cognitive ability and competence to a standard to be able to understand the controls of the vehicle and how to operate them safely; to be within the acceptable drink drive limit of 80mg/100ml and/or not under the influence of any other substance.


2. No requirements for legal registration and/or record of ownership of the mobility scooter.

There are many laws and regulations into the safe ownership and operation of a car or motorbike; i.e. there are vision tests, cognitive ability requirements, drink drive laws etc, all of which are in place to ensure that the person in charge of a car or motorcycle is safe and competent and does not place those around him/her at risk of harm or death because of a falling below the acceptable standard applicable when in control of a mechanically (or electrically, in the case of PHEV or hybrid) propelled vehicle.

It was, however, apparent on the evidence at Natalie's Inquest that no similar laws or protections are in place for those who operate mobility scooters meaning that someone who is legally prevented from driving due to age, infirmity or other inability is feely able to own, use and operate a mobility scooter without any restriction whatsoever. The Inquest heard that the current legislation appears to distinguish between vehicles based on power and speed. However, as was evident in Natalie's case, mobility scooters can reach a fast enough speed to pose a significant risk to the entire community and population but specifically, small children, pregnant mothers and the elderly who are all particularly vulnerable to being impacted at speed by a blunt-force object and dying as a result of the injuries that they sustain.

I am concerned that the lack of regulation around mobility scooters will continue to result in further deaths, especially when there continues to be no regulation around those who are deemed fit to operate and use them.","On the 16th April 2022 the then-Senior Coroner, Mr Tony Williams, commenced an investigation into the death of Natalie Ann Young, aged 92 (""Natalie"").  

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, heard before me, on the 8thFebruary 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental death, including medical cause of death being 
la) Lolwer respiratory tract infection 
lb) immobility 
le) fall with a humeral fracture 
11) Frailty  

With a finding in box 3 that: Natalie Ann Young, aged 92, died at Musgrove Park Hospital on the 13th April 2022 from a lower respiratory tract infection which she was more prone to develop following a period of immobility after an incident on the 9th March 2022 where she was knocked over by a mobility scooter. She sustained a humeral fracture during this incident but, on the balance of probabilities, the trauma and insult was too much for her physiological reserve, despite being an very active and spritely 92 year old lady.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 05th April 2023.

Nancy Carolyn Price, aged 62 at the time of her death, presented to the Emergency Department of Wrexham Maelor Hospital on 30 December 2020 via ambulance which had arrived at her home at 16:37. She had sudden onset of movement and sensation in both lower limbs since midday. She was eventually seen by a medic, at approximately 9.45pm, when limb ischaemia was diagnosed. In consultation with the on call vascular consultant at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd, where vascular services are centralised for the Health Board, urgent CT angiogram was advised, IV heparin and pain relief, and also urgent ambulance transfer to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd. Nancy Price arrived many hours later, at approximately 3am and required rehydrating prior to the surgery. The surgery was commenced at approximately 05:55. Following surgery she developed multi organ failure and died on 1 January 2021.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.
In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
An investigation was commenced by the Health Board into the death of Nancy Carolyn Price, a significant time after her death and was completed only on 9 June 2022, some 17 months after her death. At Inquest it was identified that not all actions arising have been fully completed and the dates by when actions ought to have been completed (according to the investigation report) not adhered to. For example, the investigation report was due to be shared with vascular services to share learning by June 2022 (once approved) and yet the Report was only shared with vascular services in January 2023.

The actions arising from the investigation report are not always realistic. For example, one action was to identify any gaps in knowledge with regards to assessment and management of vascular emergencies, including recording of limb colour, sensation and movement, by the end of June 2022, approximately 3-4 weeks after the final report.

I have previously issued Prevention of Future Death Reports to the Health Board pertaining to the lack of timeliness of their investigations.

I remain significantly concerned that the strategic management of internal Health Board investigations is lacking leading to investigations that are too slow, actions are not always realistic and, as a result, identification of areas for learning and training are not understood quickly enough, such that deaths will occur or will continue to occur into the future unless rapid action is taken.","On 11 January 2021 an investigation was commenced into the death of Carolyn Nancy Price (DOB 3/6/1958) who died on 1 January 2021. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 April 2023. 

The conclusion of the inquest was a narrative conclusion as follows :  
Nancy Carolyn Price died on 1 January 2021 at Ysbyty Glan Clwyd. There was a delay in assessing her and transferring her from Ysbyty Maelor to Ysbyty Glan Clwyd to the extent that there were missed opportunities for her to undergo timely and possible life saving surgery.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely 21 June 2023.

of alcohol in his blood at the time of his death, and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus.
As a result he was vulnerable and his physical health was deteriorating. Following a
Care Act assessment on 7th September 2020 social services determined that the
Deceased required placement with 24-hour care appropriate to meet his care and
support needs. A referral was made to the Extra Care Housing team in order that a
suitable placement be found. In the meantime the Deceased was placed in supported
accommodation provided by Supported Independence Limited. The services provided
Supported Independence Limited were registered with the Care Quality Commission
(CQC). However, the Deceased's accommodation was a small flat within a single
building comprising a number of similar fiats. The building was licensed with the local
authority as a house in multiple occupation (HMO) and therefore was not within the
remit of the CQC.

On moving to his supported accommodation on 6th February 2019 a support plan and
risk assessment were prepared. One of the risks identified was that he was at risk
when bathing independently due to his mobility issues, his heavy drinking and his
diabetes. The risk was to be managed by the Deceased telling the staff when he was
going to have a bath and the staff would then monitor him regularly so that they could
attend to any problems he may have.

On the morning of 28th September 2020 the Deceased was found by a member of
staff unresponsive in his bath. He had not informed staff of his intention to take a
bath. The bath was full of water and the Deceased was almost completely
submerged. A member of staff described the water as 'boiling' meaning it was very hot
and not literally. A paramedic who attended was unable to put his gloved hand into the
water because it was so hot. The Deceased was pronounced dead at the scene.

The post-mortem examination confirmed the Deceased had suffered with injuries in
keeping with scalding. The degree of burns/ scalding was not sufficient to cause
death on their own but the pain and trauma likely precipitated acute myocardial
ischaemia. Death by drowning was considered unlikely.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1) Mr. Evans resided in supported accommodation which was appropriately licensed as an HMO. The provision and maintenance of services, including electricity, gas and water was the responsibility of Supported Independence Limited. However, the HMO licence did not require there be thermostatic control valves fitted to the hot water taps in the Deceased's flat.
(2) Since the Deceased resided in his own accommodation and was not provided with a regulated activity. the accommodation was not regulated nor subject to inspection by the CQC.
(3) Similarly the HSE had no authority to inspect premises under the Health and Safety at Work Act 197 4 as the Deceased resided in his own home.
(4) if the Deceased, who was vulnerable, had resided in health and social care premises then there would have been a requirement to assess the risk of scalding and burning in the context of his vulnerability.
(5) Engineering controls could then have been provided to minimise the risk of scalding particularly where there is whole body immersion.
(6) In accommodating vulnerable persons in such an HMO there appears to be a deficiency in the regulatory framework in that there is no requirement to assess and manage the risk of scalding and no oveiview by any regulatory body.","On 9th December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr. Christopher Evans age 56 years.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)  

1. Adult Social Care were first involved in 2017 due to the deceased self neglecting. It is recorded assessments were not able to be completed.  

2. It was not until April 2021, 3 years later and despite care packages being in place and funded by Lincolnshire county Council, that the deceased became known again to Adult Social Care where it was deemed necessary to provide ongoing support of the Wellbeing team and Adult Social Care until his passing in November 2021.This was as a result of a referral from the GP. What happened in those 3 years by way of observations upon the deceased by safeguarding and if none shouldn't there have been something in place? Nothing has been evidenced to date. Shouldn't measures have been in place to review/monitor?  

3. EMAS make there own safeguarding referral on 29th November 2021 as he appeared to them on the one time they saw the deceased that he was underweight and showing signs of clinical dehydration. If they were able to observe this why is none else in Adult Social Care making the same assessment during his lifetime?

4. After his death LCC decide to undertake a s.42 assessment under the categories of neglect and acts of omission.

5. The outcome from the admitted ""limited information gathered"" was that no risk was identified and no action taken. Despite the toxicology report still to be received the enquiry was closed and never reopened. As a result no appropriate action was taken to mitigate any risks to others.

6. Conflicting evidence was provided by bluebird care that :
Registered Manager (02/02/2023) - ""the only drink we pour for him is water, we never poured alcohol for him""
""26th November 2021 14:24 from carer's log - ""water and whiskey provided on top of ongoing medication""
EMAS report (12/04/2022) - ""bottles of alcohol were found by his bed and enquired with the carers ,however they believed he doesn't drink a lot as he was unable to pour on his own"".
If that is right somebody was pouring for him. Shouldn't all this have been picked up by the safeguarding assessment?

7. Instead the s.42 reporter according to the live evidence of the principal practitioner of the Adult Safeguarding team of the day, appears to have collated only limited information and closed the inquiry down prematurely without looking at material documents or even awaiting the toxicology report. At the very least it should be reopened to see if there was any missed opportunities from which lessons could be learnt and future deaths prevented and to embody the whole purpose of a s.42 assessment in deciding what action to take to support and protect the person in question. It being reiterated that this assessment was only commissioned after the deceased had passed away.","On 14 December 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Colin Robert GUMM aged 65.

3. However, shortly after discharge, Louis had a further seizure in the early evening 17.00 hours of 11th February 2021. The emergency services attended and after a period of observation, Louis remained at home.

4. On 1st May 2021 Louis attended the Emergency Department at St Peters Hospital accompanied by his father over concerns of a 1 day history of being lethargic, clingy and wobbly on his feet following a minor head injury 5 days prior. Louis was discharged after observations were normal and no abnormalities, including neurological deficits, were found.

5. On the 13th May 2021, Louis's parents visited and were reassured by the GP following concern over a further seizure whilst Louis was at nursery on a background of concerns over Louis's developmental regression.

6. On 18th June 2021 Louis had been clinically unwell and was laid down to sleep for the night. Louis was found unresponsive a short time later. Emergency services attended and Louis was taken to SPH with ongoing resuscitation but to no avail and Louis was recognised to have died at
21.53 hours on 18th June 2021 at SPH, Chertsey at 22 months of age.

7. Autopsy confirmed Louis had a viral infection at the time of his death and genetic studies confirmed a diagnosis of Dravet's Syndrome, a condition associated with developmental regression and delay, autism and epilepsy which can be triggered by pyrexia and may be resistant to treatment with antiepileptic agents.","1.Management and investigation of Febrile Seizures
Evidence was heard that a number of children who have 'febrile' seizures subsequently die from 'sudden unexpected death in childhood'. Evidence was provided that there should be greater emphasis on medical education, research and public information for sudden unexpected deaths associated with febrile seizures. Further evidence was heard that referrals for assessment and investigation of febrile seizures should be undertaken earlier to exclude a more severe underlying illness.

2.Information provided to parents/guardians after their child had a Febrile Seizure
Evidence was heard that the NHS website and pamphlet provided to parents/guardians following a child's febrile seizure is insufficiently informative to provide parents with sufficiently detailed information to assist them in picking up potential early indicators of a more severe illness
e.g.issues with gait, co-ordination, definition of complex seizures, developmental regression etc.

3.Improvement to and highlighting of the JRCALC guidelines for paramedic management of seizures in children JRCALC guidelines indicated paramedics should have conveyed Louis to hospital or contacted the GP and/or Out of Hours GP service following Louis's second seizure on 11th February 2020, as the close proximity of two seizures indicated it was a 'complex febrile seizure' rather than a febrile seizure. This led to a lost opportunity to expeditiously trigger further investigation and/or a referral to either the 'first seizure' service or to a specialist paediatrician for further assessment and management. Evidence was heard that improving and highlighting JRCALC guidelines with additional teaching would prevent this happening again.

4.General Practice 
At his mother's request after the possibility of a further seizure, Louis was reviewed by his general practitioner on the 13th May 2021 following which Louis's mother was reassured without a detailed history from Louis's motheror a full neurological examination and in theabsence of documentation in circumstances whereby it was acknowledged there was sufficient information at that time to refer Louis to secondary services for the management of children with febrile seizures. It would therefore be appropriate to consider providing robust national guidance and education to general practitioners to ensure appropriate history, examination, investigation are undertaken to allow timely referrals to secondary medical services to be undertaken.

5. Febrile Seizure Pathway
Evidence was heard that Louis was seen by a number of clinicians without a co-ordinated response to his presentation and that consideration should be given for all hospitals emergency departments and GP's to be provided with a febrile seizure pathway as a checklist to ensure children are not given a diagnosis of a 'febrile seizure when this is not supported by their presentation and for all consultations - including GP appointment and information from the paramedics is available for all clinicians to view to provide a holistic picture and to assist further management.","On 8th February 2022 I recommenced an investigation into the death of Louis James Rogers.

In December 2020 on a diagnosis of depressive illness incorporating psychotic symptoms, Mr Charles was made subject to an order under section 3 of the Mental Health Act 1983.

On 10th April 2021 Mr Charles was found unresponsive, suspended [REDACTED]
on the mental health ward.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1. A failure to adequately assess risk of harm - Poor record keeping and a failure to read electronic records meant that important information was not considered at a Multi-Disciplinary Team (""MD T"") ward round on 6th April 2021. The MDT arrived at a conclusion that Mr Charles' risk of self-harm was ""no risk"". A psychologist's assessment on the clinical record that assessed Mr Charles risk of self-harm as high on 31/3/21 was neither read nor incorporated into the MDT discussion.

2. A decision to reduce observation frequency made by the MDT on 6/4/21 was not supported by the Trust Policy guidance which indicated that enhanced observations were appropriate.

3. A failure to ensure that a treatment plan was followed - observations between
16.00 and 17.00 on the day of Mr Charles' death were suspended by the ward shift co-ordinator. The decision meant all patients subject to general observation on the ward were ignored.

4. Failures to respond to an emergency adequately - The Trust described the emergency response as chaotic . Staff agreed that they ""panicked "" and did not follow policy, specific issues include;
a. A ward emergency bell was not sounded,
b. An anti-barricade key was not used to open Mr Charles' door, instead the door was forced open causing a risk of harm to Mr Charles .
c. A ligature cutter could not be used promptly as it was secured in a box with a combination lock - staff did not know the combination,
d. Duty doctors were not called promptly,
e. Oxygen administration was delayed,
f. An on-site defibrillator was not used by staff
g. Staff could or would not provide a clear and relevant history to paramedics.

5. The credibility of evidence provided by Trust staff.
a. Two Trust witnesses declined to answer questions put to them regarding whether their observation records were truthful.
b. Observation records appeared to have been created utilising a ""cut and paste"" function.
c. Records often inaccurately recorded the prescribed frequency of observation.
d. Factually inaccurate entries were made in the record following Mr Charles' death. On 11th April 2021 an entry stated that Mr Charles was, ""Awake in his bedroom sitting on his bede (sic)"" at 07.21. On 12th April two entries made at 9.48 and 11.40 recorded that Mr Charles' was alive and well. Senior Trust witnesses characterised these entries as dishonest.

6. Governance process failings.
a. A datix incident report created on the evening of 10th April 2021 by a senior nurse and Modern Matron contained misleading information that suggested that emergency response policies were followed when in fact they were not.
b. The Datix failed to mention that observations had been suspended by the shift coordinator, a fact that was understood at that time. This obvious and significant piece of information that should have been escalated through the Trust governance team for action.
C. The Trust 72 hour report was written by the Modern Matron and was signed-off by an integrated care director on 15th April 2021. This document also failed to identify or escalate the significant issue of the suspension of observation at 16.00 on 10th April 2021.
d. The Trust SI report presented to the inquest failed to address the poor risk assessment or inadequate datix & 72 hr reports.","On 11th April 2021 this Court commenced an investigation into the death of Winbourne Gregory Charles, aged 58. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held before a jury between the 17th and 21st April 2023.

""Suicide, contributed to by neglect, to which failures in medical intervention contributed and to which failures to respond to an obvious risk of self-harm contributed.""

Suicide
Samuel's mental health and his use of drugs and/or alcohol probably contributed to his death.

We believe that the following matters also possibly made more than minimal, trivial or negligible contributions to his death

a)The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the possibility of a rehabilitative placement.

There were inadequate provisions for Samuel's complex needs. In particular, it was noted that no alternative treatments were proactively pursued. The agencies identified Covid as an obstacle to justify their inadequate responses.

b)The failure to inadequately share risk information by Social Services and/or Mental Health Services with each other, and with the police.

A number of factors were noted in this regard:

•Missing risk assessments were not completed consistently

•The Grab Pack was not completed

•iii) Samuel's vulnerabilities and suicide notes were not adequately communicated to the police by Social Services

c) The sharing of risk information by the MPS and/or BTP with partner agencies.

A number of factors were noted in this regard:
•There was a failure to share risk information by the MPS with BTP, as well as with partner agencies.
•In particular, there was a failure to complete and update the CYP Fonns, or Merlin, as a result of each agency using their own platfonn.
•In addition, the BTP did not access the PNC to identify Samuel's Warning Markers

d) Steps taken by the MPS to seek an assessment of Samuel's mental health by a Liaison and Diversion Practitioner whilst he was in custody on 30 and 31 August 2020

The following was noted in this regard:
•Actions noted on THRIVE regarding the provision of a mental health assessment for Samuel were not followed up on multiple occasions.

e) The inadequate approach of staff and the safeguarding processes within Croydon Custody Suite

A number of factors were noted in this regard:

•Samuel's actions were regarded as 'attention-seeking'.
•The DASH and CYP Fonns were not completed.
•The limited collaboration between the MPS and BTP led to a lack of recognition of Samuel's mental health needs, resulting in inadequate care.

f) Failures by multiple agencies and the inadequate response to the 'missing persons' investigation conducted by the MPS

A number of factors were noted in this regard:
•Failure to share infonnation by different agencies
•Failure by multiple agencies to contact Samuel's family when he went missing.

g) Samuel's interactions with his girlfriends The following was noted in this regard:
•Samuel's relationships were described as 'chaotic' and this impacted on his mental health and his behaviour
• In particular, the texts from his girlfriends telling him to 'kill himself as well as the threats by another girlfriend to end her life, had a significant impact on Samuel's behaviour.","During the course of the investigation, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN (some of which overlap) are as follows:

(1) Samuel's case should be a stimulus for some level of Child & Adolescent Mental Health Service reflection on how different Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service teams are organised and work together.

(2) The delayed response of the Adult Complex Additions Service to referral and issues related to provision of care to adolescents presenting with mental health vulnerabilities and substance use difficulties.

(3) The lack of a complex service providing, to adolescents, treatment for both substance misuse and mental health issues models, in terms of willingness to engage, being problematic for some young people.

(4) The inadequate response of mental health and social care services in relation to Samuel's dependency on alcohol and the provision of a rehabilitative placement.

She developed gallstone pancreatitis requiring admission to Kings Mill Hospital on 16.3.22. She had a cardiac arrest on the ward at KMH on 18.3.22, and as a consequence developed multi organ failure, requiring Critical Care treatment. She had a period of care at KMH CCU, but had to be transferred to Burton Hospital on 22.3.22 as KMH CCU was at operational capacity. She continued to make good progress on the CCU at Burton Hospital, but there were continuing issues of difficult airway management.

Jodie had a tracheostomy tube placed on 31.3.22, which became displaced early morning on 2.4.22. This could not be replaced, nor another airway achieved. She died from a further prolonged cardiac arrest as a consequence of this final hypoxic event.

The Determination dated 19.4.23 gives detailed findings as to the circumstances of Jodie's death, and is appended to this report.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows 
· There is limited evidence to date for the introduction and continuing use of comprehensive airway strategies, with structured planning and preparation, when a difficult airway is anticipated. There should be airway plans A, B, and C recorded, shared, and the equipment and skills to carry them out must be available
· There is limited evidence to date for the universal use of the NAP4 algorithms and checklists, which should be available on the difficult airway trolley, and be familiar to all ICU nursing and medical staff, and to the wider anaesthetic team

· There is limited evidence to date, for the robust daily checking of all necessary equipment on the difficult airway trolley, to ensure immediate replacement of all key equipment if it is broken or misplaced

· The Mortality Review policy was not followed, leading to a significant delay in completing the serious incident review, delaying Trust learning, and delaying the family's understanding of the circumstances of Jodie's death. There is limited evidence of progress in implementing the national Patient Safety Incident Response Framework at the Trust
I am not reassured that necessary actions to address these serious issues identified are in place.","On the 2nd April 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of Jodie Catherine McCann. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 19th April 2023  

The conclusion of the inquest was a Narrative as follows:  
Jodie died on the 2nd April 2022 at Queens Hospital, Burton-on- Trent, following a prolonged cardiac arrest, caused by a lack of oxygen, as the trachea could not be re- intubated following the sudden displacement of her tracheostomy tube. Jodie required the tracheostomy tube to provide ventilation to her lungs, as she had developed multi organ failure following an earlier cardiac arrest of at least 17 minutes at Kings Mill Hospital on 18.3.22. This first arrest at Kings Mill Hospital was sudden and unpredictable, likely caused by airway obstruction, from a combination of opiates affecting her breathing, her high BMI, and the pain and stress of gallstone pancreatitis which required strong opiate medication. Undertreated Hypothyroidism also likely made a more than minimal contribution to this first arrest. Jodie was making a reasonable recovery from the first arrest, with improving neurology and reducing ventilatory requirements. She was transferred to Burton Hospital on 22.3.22 for further critical care management. There she continued to improve, but required continuing ventilation. A tracheostomy tube to aid weaning from ventilation was inserted on 31.3.22. There was no individualised planning for the possibility of tracheostomy displacement , which was a known risk, with no plan to ensure the correct equipment was available, and no plan to ensure senior help was available as quickly as possible, should the tracheostomy tube become displaced. These serious issues of care at Burton Hospital, on a balance of probability, made a more than minimal contribution to Jodie's death.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 16th June 2023.

- At the time he died, [REDACTED] was in the early stages of an assessment process aimed at confirming if he had a diagnosis of autism. His Parents had long suspected he was different from their other children.

- He had attended a review on 23/07/22 with a Consultant Paediatrician, but there was more work to be done.

- His family feel that had he been assessed earlier, and a diagnosis made, they may have been more equipped to deal with [REDACTED] on his more challenging days.

- The court was informed that he had waited around three years for assessment. This was immensely frustrating. His Parents regularly learned that young people perceived to be more challenging were added to the waiting list at a much later stage, and allocated a place higher up that waiting list, with the inevitable consequence that [REDACTED] assessment was further delayed.

- In April 2022, there was finally some progress and they became aware that the assessment process was to commence, but as it turned out not in sufficient time for him to have been assessed, diagnosed, and for his Parents to be given the help they feel they needed to support him before he died.

- In a witness statement provided for the inquest, [REDACTED] Father described some of his character traits including:

- [REDACTED] was a very physical, affectionate child;
- He was interested in the outdoors, nature, wildlife, arts and crafts.
- He was making excellent academic progress;
- He was very self-deprecating
- He was a risk taker.
- He was impulsive.

- Although the assessment process was in motion by the time he died, his Parents remained of the opinion that once assessed, he would most likely have been diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD].","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to send the report:

The MATTER OF CONCERN is as follows. 

- With finite resources, it is acknowledged that it may not be possible for all
young people to be assessed in as timely a manner as required, but there must surely come a point whereby, notwithstanding those finite resources, the wait for assessment is taking too long.

- The wait for assessment placed [REDACTED] at risk, and other children will be similarly at risk in the absence of a timely assessment.

- It is possible that had he been diagnosed earlier, and with enough time for the relevant professionals to have been able to carry out some meaningful work with him, and had his extremely supportive Parents been given more support, [REDACTED] death may have been avoided.","The death of [REDACTED] on 24th September 2022 at his home address was reported to me and I opened an investigation which concluded by way of an inquest held on 29th March 2023.

In box 3 of the Record of Inquest I recorded as follows:
[REDACTED]  He was in the process of being assessed for autism but no diagnosis had yet been made.

She misjudged the crossing and despite seeing the vehicle still attempted to cross the road. When struck by the car she landed on her head causing catastrophic injuries. Police witnessed the incident and were immediately on scene.
Throughout the advanced life support she remained in cardiac arrest, without a pulse or signs of breathing. She was conveyed to Hull Royal Infirmary where CPR was ceased and she was declared dead.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) On a Friday and Saturday night the Lowgate area of Hull city is exceptionally busy with people enjoying the night time economy. As such many are in drink. The area of Lowgate is open to traffic, it is also the location of a taxi rank. There is only one crossing facility (aside from at either end of the road), the road narrows significantly at one end.

(2) Police raised concerns as follows:
- The road remaining open during a Friday and Saturday night.
- The number of pedestrians using the area.
- Many people in drink in the area having to cross the road.
- The road is a 30 mph.
- Lights of vehicles are distracting
- The location of the taxi rank, pedestrians having to navigate around the parked taxis, some with lights on, to enter the road. Taxis do 3 point turns in the road and any vehicle doing this is a danger to pedestrians.

(3) Evidence was heard one doorman working in the area who stated ""Having worked at the same location for some time, the area where the bars are on Lowgate is an accident waiting to happen. Members of the public are leaving the bars in a drunken state and they just wander into the road to cross, many of them not even looking for traffic on the road. Some vehicles travel down Lowgate far too fast given the evening activity"" and another doorman stated ""the road and both the footpaths at the location of the collision occurred on Lowgate are both very narrow. There is also a taxi rank outside O'Leary's which doesn't help as taxis were parked there at the time of the collision. I have seen numerous near misses over the years I have worked in the area. It is no exaggeration to say that there are between six to twelve incidents each night between cars and pedestrians, one thing which does not help and is also dangerous are taxis which do U turns in the road once they have collected their fare"".

(4) The police had previously made recommendations and further felt that closing Lowgate to all through traffic on a Friday and Saturday evening, making Lowgate a total no stopping zone on an evening between certain hours, moving the location of a taxi rank onto nearby Alfred Gelder Street.

(5) I note the statement from the local authority listed
-They have erected 2 speed signs since the incident. Bearing in mind that this incident occurred with a vehicle travelling well within the limits, traffic is the concern not limited to the speed of vehicles.
-The council was looking at developing a document that reviewed speed limits for the whole of the city centre. Lowgate has a special reason for being an area of concern and should be looked at as a priority and not in conjunction with all other city centre streets.
-That engagement with the councils public transport department has commenced with the intention to relocate the taxi rank to Alfred Gelder street ""but this requires consultation with the Hackney Carriage Association"". No indication was given regarding what was being done to facilitate this.
-The council say that there are no resources to manage the road closure, despite acknowledging it is their responsibility. The fact the road is open at this time is a danger and I am concerned given the comments of the doormen that the danger is being underestimated.
-Crossing facilities had been looked at but could not be positioned within a suitable distance.

(6) I am concerned that inappropriate weight has been given to the danger arising in this area and that without appropriate action further incidents will occur.","On 2nd September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rebecca Lisa KIRBY, aged 31 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 29th March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was Road Traffic Incident. 
 
Box 3 of the record of inquest read:  
On the evening of 27th August 2021 Rebecca Lisa KIRBY was out socialising. She misjudged the traffic on Lowgate, Hull and ran in to the path of an oncoming vehicle. The vehicle was travelling at 23 miles per hour however the way Ms Kirby landed resulted in significant head injuries, causing her to become immediate unresponsive. Despite many people coming to her aid to offer advanced life support, she remained in cardiac arrest. She was transported to Hull Royal Infirmary where she was declared deceased.  

One of the findings of fact stated: Miss Kirby had crossed behind a passing car which would obscure any oncoming vehicles view of her. In addition to lights, taxis and other pedestrians in the vicinity.

There was a delay in conveying Mrs Robinson to hospital, in the order of around 50 minutes, but there is no evidence that this delay contributed to her death. Mrs Robinson was taken to Queen's Hospital where a diagnosis of mixed drug toxicity, on the background of severe co-morbidities, was made. She was provided with intensive care. Sadly she did not recover and she passed away at Queen's Hospital on the 8 May 2022.

She was not assessed by a doctor in the home treatment team before her discharge and she did not receive a comprehensive risk assessment in the days leading up to her discharge.

Richard had been drinking alcohol all day and at the event and by 21:23 when he collected his trophy he was clearly showing the effects of alcohol inebriation and this was apparent to people at the event, including club members. About thirty minutes later he was unable to walk and had reduced responsiveness and he had to be carried to an outside bench. When it was realised that he was possibly critically unwell an ambulance was called, although medically trained attendees at the club event had started to provide resuscitative interventions, including use of a defibrillator which identified there was no shockable rhythm. Paramedics attended but intensive resuscitation was sadly unable to revive Richard and he was pronounced dead at the scene.  

Richard was known to drink heavily when out with friends and at social events. The court heard evidence from Richard's brother that Richard's alcohol consumption appeared to increase following the death of a close friend in January 2022.  

After Richard's death, as part of post-mortem examination, blood and urine samples were sent for toxicological testing. Toxicology identified a very high level of alcohol in Richard's system, at a level capable of causing death due to alcohol toxicity. Cocaine was also identified in Richard's system but was not considered to be contributory to his death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:   
The inquest heard evidence that some people, probably including Richard, were drinking alcohol from trophy cups at the rugby club event and that these were being topped up by various people in the course of the evening, such that the trophy cups contained mixed drinks. Post-mortem toxicological analysis of Richard's blood and urine demonstrated a toxic level of alcohol in his system, and he had been drinking alcohol all day, including prior to the event.

The inquest heard evidence that excess alcohol consumption is likely a problem across all male sports. The rugby club had received educative/campaign material from the Rugby Football Union (RFU) on issues including mental health but not specifically concerning alcohol misuse and alcohol awareness. The club is a local grassroots club, effectively run by volunteers, and it seems to me that the RFU might consider providing guidance and educative material around alcohol use that would potentially be welcome and utilised by affiliate grassroots rugby clubs and could have a positive impact on harmful drinking.","On 10 May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Richard James HILL, referred to as Richard for the purposes of the inquest, aged 24.

Mr. Da Cruz was seen to be in difficulties and his body was later washed up on the shore. Mr. Dupar was seen to be in difficulties and was brought to the beach unconscious. He had suffered from hypoxic brain damage and died at Ashford Hospital, Kent on the 28th of July. The other five deceased were all part of a party of five young Sri Lankan men who travelled together to Camber to enjoy a day at the beach on 24t of August 2016. They all went into the sea at a time when the tide had started to come in. It is not known how well any of them could swim. It is thought that they were all on a sand bar when they were overtaken and cut off by the incoming tide. All five bodies were recovered to the shore that day, or found after the tide had receded. The RNLI had recommended deploying lifeguards at the beach in 2013 but Rother District Council had not implemented that recommendation. It was accepted quite quickly after these deaths and lifeguards are now deployed. There was considerable evidence at the inquest on the question of whether that step, and others recommended, would have prevented any of the deaths. It should be noted that the length of the beach from which people can swim is about three miles and the distance between high water mark and low water mark is as much as a kilometre in some tides.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(a) There are possibly lessons in the circumstances of and the issues surrounding these deaths which may be of help to others on a national basis.

(b) There appears to be no formal governance or control of risk management requirements. Should the present, virtually voluntarily, structure be examined? Could perhaps the Marine and Coastguard Agency, who have enforcement powers akin to those of the Police, be given more resources and take a bigger role than they currently have? The problem is an increasing one. The evidence suggested that on a pleasant hot summer's day 25,000 to 30,000 people visit Camber Sands, many of whom have language difficulties and do not speak much English, and many others of whom have no experience of going into the sea. The question is whether leaving matters to a charity is really the best basis of a structure intended to spearhead a possibly overdue attempt to modernise, harmonise, and improve the safety regime, given so many changes at Camber.

(c) Changes include:
(i) possible climate change effects,
(ii) differences in ethnic origins and language spoken by current visitors,
(iii) constant and fast changes in means of communication with the public, which
everybody at these inquests agreed to be crucial to the necessary educative process,
(iv) improvement, considered vital, of education and awareness of coastal dangers amongst children and those who live far from the sea.

(d) Inevitably resource and monetary considerations affect decision making by those charged with safeguarding people like the seven who died here. Perhaps that is another reason why a review of the current system may well be needed.

(e) There was pessimism expressed at the inquests that any measures could prevent most deaths, only reduce them. In those circumstances, should there be consideration by central government of taking powers to restrict public use, according to daily circumstances, of parts or all of certain beaches? Certainly a localised study, on a national model, should be carried out. I believe it has elsewhere in the world.","On 24th of July 2016 I commenced an investigation into the death of GUSTAVO SILVA DA CRUZ.

She had been admitted unwell on 11th January 2022 after falling and breaking her arm. She suffered myocardial ischaemia and injury on the night of 13th /14th January which was not treated or managed in any way at all. She was not seen by a doctor again until she suffered a cardiac arrest on 18th January 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

On 13th January, at 23.15hrs a doctor reviewed Mrs Hutchins because she was complaining of being short of breath. She was alert but appeared to be very breathless, she was speaking with some difficulty. Mrs.Hutchins reported a one-day history of being short of breath with a productive cough and intermittent chest tightness. She was also nauseous. He sought advice from an SHO and documented the plan that she was for an ECG, blood test including a troponin, CRP and oxygen.

The ward cover SHO for Medicine, said that he was called initially for advice on the blood tests he said in evidence that he considered a heart attack and pulmonary embolism so said Troponin and D-Dimer. He sought advice from the Registrar who said that the ECG trace was not normal.

The Registrar said that at the time she had raised CPR and that she had a productive cough and he considered that this was a pneumonia. He said that he considered Troponin but thought that it would not be a useful test in the circumstances. His plan at this time was to give antibiotics, IV fluids, to repeat her heart trace in half an hour and to increase her observations to 1 hourly.

It is known that the Troponin result was returned at 01.35hrs on 14th January and that it was raised at 358.

The SHO saw Mrs Hutchins at 04.57 that morning, he had noted the raised Troponin, he made a plan for the day team to review her and for bloods to be done to include a serial Troponin level. He also recalls that he gave a handover and spoke to the nurses. He said he expected her to be reviewed. Mrs Hutchins did not have a medical review on 14th or 15th or 16th or 17th.

On 18th January at 06.45 Mrs Hutchins was admitted to the intensive care unit. That she had suffered a cardiac arrest on Pierce ward, she had felt light-headed whilst sitting on the commode and the nursing staff helped her back to bed; where it was noted her blood pressure was low and heart rate fast around 30 minutes before she suffered a cardiac arrest. It was estimated that the cardiac arrest lasted for around 15 minutes. I was told that the arrest call was put out at 04.41hrs and CPR started in 4 minutes.

An urgent angiogram found multivessel coronary artery disease including a severe stenosis in the right coronary artery. She was assessed for neurological function after the cardiac arrest which unfortunately showed seizure activity. This is associated with a poor outcome. She remained deeply unconscious and died on 23rd January 2022.

A Consultant Cardiologist based at the RUH provided his opinion having reviewed the medical records. He had not been involved with Mrs Hutchins care. He confirmed that:
• She had chest pain an abnormal ECG and an elevated Troponin.
• Her heart was under strain and she was not treated at the time
• She was not seen by a doctor for 4 days, she should have been. He would expect all patients to be seen on a working day. A medical patient not seen for 4 days is not right.
• She had an elevated risk profile due to the cardiac stenosis but also her hypertension, diabetes, her age - she was in a higher risk group.

• In the daytime there should be a review and then a discussion with the cardiologist team.
• He said that her episode of chest pain and breathlessness on 13th/14th together with an ischemic ECG and elevated Troponin would be compatible with myocardial ischaemia and injury. That he would have commenced her on standard therapy for ACS antiplatelets and an anticoagulant. That patients with suspected or confirmed ACS should have cardiac monitoring. The ideal pathway would be transfer to a monitored area such as the coronary care unit or cardiac ward; a cardiology review, repeat echocardiography and inpatient angiography.
• It was accepted that this may not have all happened but she should have been reviewed by cardiology; had ACS treatment; monitored carefully; the risk of a second event is reduced by the ACS treatment, it might have made a difference. If treated she may still have suffered a cardiac arrest.
• If she'd had the senior review and suffered the cardiac arrest in a different place she would have been treated more promptly.
The Registrar said if he'd been aware of the raised Troponin his threshold to treat her for a heart attack would have been lower. He agreed with the cardiologist's view about how Mrs Hutchins should have been treated.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
I was told that there have been a number of changes following this death at the RUH. However that there were two areas which remain outstanding:

(1) The hospital at night team, to assist with management of the hospital at night, take calls from wards, log and triage the calls, coordinate the night team, send clinicians tasks - this is still to be put into place, funding has not been secured for this.

(2) The acute cardiac syndrome (ACS) specialist nurse practitioner role - this is not in existence at this time which I am told would be an excellent compliment for the teams and support staff during the daytime hours.","On 28 January 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Elizabeth Mavis HUTCHINS.

Although Mrs. Smith sustained no obvious physical injury, she complained of head pain the same evening and was taken by ambulance to the Leicester Royal Infirmary in the early hours of 16 March 2022, where she was diagnosed with spinal fractures. On a balance of probabilities, the injuries were caused by a high energy fall and in keeping with having fallen down the stairs. At the hospital Mrs. Smith was treated conservatively due to her age and dementia; she deteriorated over the following days and, after discussions with family members on 21 March 2022, she was placed on palliative care and died the following day.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

At the time of Mrs. Smith's fall, there were 17 residents and 2 carers. One carer was attending a resident upstairs and the other carer was outside the care home accompanying another resident who wished to have a cigarette. This meant that no carer was in the lounge area monitoring the residents. Accordingly, when Mrs. Smith left the lounge area she was not monitored as required. If she had been monitored, it is understood that she would have been offered assistance and, on a balance of probabilities, the fall that led to her death would not have occurred.

It was understood that at the care home there were, and still is, a number of residents with challenging behaviour and care needs, and that for some activities of daily living 2 carers may be required. With only 2 carers on a shift, it is foreseeable that residents can and will be left unattended. It is also foreseeable that competing needs of the residents will mean that residents will be left unmonitored, and an unsafe environment created as occurred with Mrs. Smith. Accordingly, there remains a concern that the provider has not done everything possible to mitigate the risk of actual or potential harm including death.","On 31 March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Janet SMITH aged 81. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 24 April 2023.

He likely had Asperger's syndrome. At the time of his death was under the care of the community mental health team following a suicide attempt by hanging in December 2021 following which he was formally sectioned. After his release he was allocated a care coordinator who between May 2022 and his death in October 2022 saw him on only three occasions (his care plan envisaging weekly involvement). The Trust was aware that the relationship between Ben and his care coordinator had broken down but a new care coordinator was not appointed and Ben had no contact from the community mental health team for 5 weeks before his death on 12th October 2023 when he hanged himself at his mother's home address. He had telephoned the Crisis team three times in the two days before his death, calls which included complaints of having been abandoned by the mental health team, expressions of hopelessness about his future and indications that he felt suicidal. He was informed that the community mental health team would contact him. Although the community mental health team and the care coordinator were notified of Ben's calls the day before his death, no one attempted contact until after this death had occurred. Kent & Medway NHS partnership Trust accepted at the inquest that the care provided to Ben fell below the standard he could have expected to receive and there were missed opportunities to treat him.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.   
The Trust had a shortfall of nursing staff in the Dover and Deal area at the time that Benjamin Hart was under the community mental health team such that although 16 nurses were required to run the service, the Trust only had 8 nurses employed at the time, 2 of whom were long term sick. This left a working complement of 6 nurses to cover the whole area, which required them to take on additional duties. There was no resilience within the team and therefore when the relationship between Ben and his care coordinator broke down there was no capacity within the team to allocate him another care coordinator.

Although the Trust has regrouped, reorganised and there has been some limited recruitment the shortfall endures; the evidence given at the inquest being that this is a national issue but it is
particularly difficult to recruit within this area of Kent","On 17th October 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Benjamin James HART. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest 28th March 2023.

She was 17 at the time of her death. The key facts in this case are as follows:
· Alexandra had no significant past medical history.
· She underwent an uneventful tonsillectomy on 22nd May 2021.
· After returning home, she suffered post-operative bleeding and required further surgery.
· The second operation was carried out on 30th May.
· When the anaesthetic was administered on 30th May, Alexandra deteriorated suddenly and suffered a cardiac arrest.
· A large number of clinicians were involved in trying to assist Alexandra, but tragically, she died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading on 31st May 2021.
· There are no concerns about her clinical management.
The most likely cause of her sudden deterioration was an anaphylactic reaction to Rocuronium, a drug which she had not had before.","Background
This is not new territory. Several coroners have raised concerns similar to mine. Those listed below are simply the cases where coroners have sent Regulation 28 reports. There may well be others.

Previous cases include :

1. In the case of Shante Turay-Thomas (who I believe was 18 at the time of her death), the Senior Coroner for Inner North London stated:

""The issues within this Prevention of Future Deaths report are predominantly national issues, but I heard at inquest that there is no person with named accountability for allergy services and allergy provision at NHS England, or the Department of Health as a whole.""

2. In the case of Robin Bousquet (who I believe was 14 at the time of death), the Coroner for Inner South London stated in a Regulation 28 Report to Prevent Future Deaths:

""In my opinion action should be taken to consider establishing a national reporting system which includes timely reporting to local authority and FSA and maintenance of a register of fatalities and their investigations, and consideration be given to investigating the feasibility of wider access to AAIs. I believe that the organizations would wish to learn of the circumstances of this death and are in a position to facilitate a collaborative process to mitigate or prevent future deaths.""

3. In the case of Ms Celia Marsh (who I believe was 42 at the time of her death), the coroner touched on many of the issues I will refer to in this report. She stated the following:

""Concerns were raised in relation to the immediate investigation into a suspected death from anaphylaxis, that the evidence obtained at this time, with the right approach, can be invaluable to preventing deaths, but that to achieve this, changes are required.

In relation to the Food Standards Agency, the UK Health Security Agency, and the Department of Health and Social Care:
· To establish a robust system of capturing and recording cases of anaphylaxes, and specifically, fatal and near-fatal anaphylaxis…
· Such a system could involve, mandatory reporting of anaphylaxis presenting to hospital analogous to the current system for notifiable diseases… by registered medical practitioners have a statutory duty to notify the 'proper officer' at their local council or local health protection team of suspected cases of certain infectious diseases. An example of such a reporting system for anaphylaxis already exists in the State of Victoria in Australia, and allows for rapid alerts of serious cases to public health authorities to expedite investigation and evaluate public health risk.""

Alexandra's case
It seems clear to all coroners in these cases, and those involved in this area of medical expertise, that the only way to improve understanding and prevent or reduce future deaths is to gather information nationally and fund appropriate research.

Appropriate organisations already exist, and there is a lot of goodwill towards improving understanding in this area. It does however require national leadership and ""joining up"" of these organisations.

The matters of concern are as follows:

1. I have tried to make my list of issues clear and succinct. Paragraph 2 below sets out the crux of this ongoing risk.

2. There is significant goodwill and desire to improve amongst numerous organisations involved in anaphylaxis work. What is lacking is national leadership and funding. In my view, consideration should be given to creating a leadership role and responsibility within NHS England to coordinate a national approach.

3. As considered by other coroners before me, it should be mandatory to refer fatal anaphylaxis cases. UKFAR has indicated that they would be prepared to take on the role of receiving these reports (to avoid duplication for reporting clinicians), with the responsibility to forward the relevant information to other organisations such as the MHRA, where appropriate. Whilst my focus is on fatal anaphylaxis, inclusion of non-fatal cases would be a matter for the lead role to consider.

4. Gathering data and using this to research and reduce the risk of future deaths requires funding, and this should be reviewed.

5. Information sharing amongst the organisations referred to in this report should be straightforward. Confidentiality constraints are important, but not the same in the case of a deceased person as they are for a living person. I believe that a confidential advisory group has already started to consider this matter.

6. Consideration of including contact details for the UKFAR in algorithms used by doctors attempting to resuscitate patients - so that there is a clear requirement for referral to UKFAR in the event of an unsuccessful resuscitation. This is currently being considered by the Resuscitation Council UK.

For my part, I have taken the following steps to increase awareness in the work that I do :

1. I have taken responsibility for making my fellow coroners aware of the existence of UKFAR and circulated guidance to them to use in anaphylaxis cases.

2. The Royal College of Pathologists is reviewing their guidance, and I intend to circulate interim guidance which coroners can send to their pathologists, pending this more official guidance.

I will also send all coroners nationally a guidance note to use for their local police forces in gathering appropriate evidence at the scene of a likely anaphylaxis case.
","I conducted an inquest into the death of Alexandra Briess, which concluded on 15thDecember 2022. I recorded a Narrative Conclusion as follows:

Alexandra Briess underwent an uneventful tonsillectomy on 22nd May 2021. She suffered post-operative bleeding, and required further surgery. This was carried out on 30th May. During anaesthesia, Alexandra suffered a sudden deterioration and cardiac arrest. Despite extensive resuscitation efforts, she died at Royal Berkshire Hospital, London Road, Reading on 31st May 2021. Subsequent investigations have revealed that the most likely cause of her sudden deterioration was an anaphylactic reaction to Rocuronium. This was a drug she had not had before, and her reaction to it was unpredictable. Alexandra was a bright and well loved young woman, who had planned to study medicine herself.

Her cause of death was:
I a Anaphylaxis due to Rocuronium used during anaesthesia I b Surgery to repair post operative bleeding 30th May 2021 I c Tonsillectomy 22nd May 2021

This Regulation 28 Report has been deliberately delayed, to allow for careful consideration of guidance to pathologists, police and coroners, and in order to ensure the report is addressed to the correct recipients. Alexandra's family has been kept updated in this respect.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths, and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report,

He was usually fit and well. However, on 29 May 2022, he had a mild viral infection (which was confirmed at post-mortem).

Chester was placed in a bath seat and given a bath in suitably warm water. The water level was higher than advised - so that Chester did not get chilled.

After about 20 minutes of bath time, Chester was left alone in his bath seat whilst a plug- in diffuser (to help his cold) was prepared in his bedroom. It was believed that the bath seat was safe and secure to hold him in place.

After a few minutes, Chester was found face down in the bath. The bath seat had become unfixed. There were no sounds that Chester was in distress or difficulty. He was immediately removed from the bath and given immediate CPR by a trained adult.
Emergency services were quickly on scene and CPR was continued by police, paramedics and clinicians. Return of spontaneous circulation was achieved.

Chester was flown by air ambulance to the Great North Children's Hospital at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle. However, an MRI scan undertaken on 2 June 2022 showed that Chester had an extensive severe brain injury consistent with severe global hypoxic ischaemia caused by drowning. It was considered that Chester was unlikely to survive and further intensive care treatment was not in his best interest.

Intensive care support was withdrawn on 3 June 2022 and Chester died peacefully in his mother's arms at 18:05.

I received a statement from RoSPA (the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents) setting out that:

· Baby bath seats are unstable and prone to toppling over leaving the baby trapped in the water.
· Bath seats may give parents and carers a false sense of security that baby is safer in a bath seat and can be left alone (despite warnings that this should not happen).
· There can be a misconception that a baby bath seat is a safety product - this is not the case.
· Under no circumstances should parents regard bath seats as a safety aid and leave a child out of arms reach.
· RoSPA is aware of incidents where parents have been in the room, but away from the baby, with tragic results.
· RoSPA is aware of a number of drownings of young children in the bath where a baby bath seat has been used.
· There may be some bath seats that are less stable than others or that have inadequate methods to hold them in place.

I heard no evidence about any safety concerns with the bath seat in question.

The Child Death Overview Panel (""CDOP"") advised me that a Bath Safety Alert had been issued in the North-East and North Cumbria. This can be viewed at:

www.nenc-healthiertogether.nhs.uk/parentscarers/keeping-your-child-safe/bath-safety- advice

I requested an update on several matters but these were not available at the date of Chester's inquest. Given the ""ancillary nature"" of Reports to Prevent Future Deaths and to avoid the distress of an adjournment to Chester's family, I decided to proceed with the inquest.","The evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

I am aware of similar tragic deaths to Chester's and inquests held by my fellow Coroners. RoSPA is also aware of fatal and non-fatal incidents.

The use of bath seats is of concern to RoSPA.

Whilst I am aware of the regional Bath Safety Advice (set out above), I am not aware that similar advice has been distributed on a national level to healthcare professionals and to parents / carers. I am not aware whether parents / carers are provided with advice about the safe use of bath seats as part of e.g. health visits.

I am concerned that bath seats may given parents a false sense of security that their child is safe. Bath seats are not safety devices.","Chester Alan Stanley MOSSOP died on 3 June 2022 following an incident at his home address on 29 May 2022. Baby Chester's death was reported to HM Coroner for Cumbria on 6 June 2022 and his death formally transferred from HM Coroner Newcastle. An investigation into his death (in accordance with Section 1 Coroners and Justice Act) was commenced on the same day.  

An inquest into Chester's death was opened on 23 February 2023 and his inquest was heard before me on 13 April 2023.  

The medical cause of Chester's death was:  
1a Hypoxic ischaemic brain injury 
1b Cardiac arrest (resuscitated) 
1c Drowning  

The determination was:  
Chester Alan Stanley Mossop was a healthy and well-looked after 9 months' old baby. On 29 May 2022, Chester was placed in a bath seat in a bath of warm water at his home. After approximately 20 minutes of bath time, Chester was left alone in his bath seat. After a few minutes, Chester was found face down in the bath, the bath seat having become unfixed. Chester was given immediate CPR which was continued by attending police, paramedics and clinicians. Chester was conveyed to the Great North Children's' Hospital at the Royal Victoria Infirmary by air ambulance. Everything was done to try to save Chester's life. However, an MRI scan showed that Chester had sustained an unsurvivable brain injury due to drowning and he died in his mother's arms on 3 June 2022 at 18:05 at the Royal Victoria Infirmary.

At the time of his death Samuel was suffering from alcohol addiction and had a diagnosis of ADHD and social anxiety. Prior to his death Samuel had received treatment from the Community Drug and Alcohol Treatment ('CDAT') team and primary mental health services. Samuel was discharged from CDAT fifteen months prior to his death. CDAT had information on their system (including from their own risk assessment) to indicate that Samuel had been assessed as a significant risk of suicide. There was other valuable information about Samuel's risk factors on the CDAT system. At the time when Samuel was under CDAT the GP had also referred Samuel to the community mental health team raising his concerns about Samuel's risk of suicide. It is not clear is CDAT had access to this letter. When the primary mental health services consultant began treating Samuel for his ADHD - which continued up to Samuel's death - he received a referral from CDAT but he did not have access to the detailed information on the CDAT electronic system. The consultant could not and did not see the CDAT risk assessment, the outcome and assessment from the individual CDAT sessions and other vital historical information of potential relevance to Samuel's risk factors and triggers for suicide.","During the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make a report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and Regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013

The first MATTERS OF CONCERN is as follows:
I am concerned that in cases where an individual is receiving treatment from alcohol and drug addiction services and treatment from the primary community mental health team that neither team is able to access the other teams records electronically. The lack of integrated electronic records between treating team means that important information regarding patient safety is not easily accessible between treating teams. Treating teams are reliant on referral letters which are necessarily limited and not always sufficient to capture all the detailed information available to a referring team. This is particularly concerning where there is dual diagnosis - such as substance misuse and mental health - given these are often complex cases. This is particularly the case where complex cases have not been referred into secondary mental health services and so do not have access to a care-coordinator who can oversee and understand the views of the various professionals treating and assisting an individual.

I am concerned that the lack of such an integrated electronic system of medical and treatment records inhibits the effective sharing of information regarding patient safety and so increases the risk that information of significance regarding a risk to life will be lost between agencies and not sufficiently understood between all those managing.","On 13th May 2019 an investigation was commenced into the death of Samuel Alexander Morgan who was found deceased in his parents' house on the 9th May 2019 after having tied a ligature around his neck.

He had historically been addicted to Class A drugs and this led him into conflict with the criminal law and with his family which had resulted in a restraining order which restricted contact with his family and periods in custody. He had significant support from a number of sources: he was supervised by the probation service and the police ""Spotlight"" team; he was working with Mosaic - an organisation who assist with drug misuse; the local authority Leaving Care team provided assistance on a voluntary basis as he was over 21 years old. The local authority housing organisation provided him with the tenancy of a flat in Marple and as part of that tenancy, he had an Offender Support Worker who assisted him. He had regular contact with his General Practitioner.  

Notwithstanding the involvement of the various agencies there was no single individual or agency responsible for the co-ordination of the package of care, support and resources. Whilst there was sharing of information between some individuals involved, it was not structured, formalised or supervised. In practice, the Housing Offender Support worker, whose role did not require any formal social work or mental health care qualifications became the person upon whom Mr Clare relied.  

An issue between Mr Clare and a neighbour developed over a period between June 2020 and his death on 26th August 2020, during the latter stages of which, he began to voice intentions to take his own life. On 26th August 2020, in a series of calls and messages to the police, Housing Officer and the Offender Support Worker, Mr Clare expressed extreme distress about the apparent lack of progress about the dispute with his neighbour and progressively, made threats to take his own life, which he did during a final call to the Housing Offender Support Officer by suspending himself by a ligature at his home.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
The Inquest heard evidence from the Head of Service for Safeguarding and Learning for Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. She highlighted a long-standing gap in provision, which was described as extending across most if not all local authorities, for vulnerable adults who have complex needs, but who do not fall into the existing framework of social services, Care Act provision or formal mental health supervision. The effect of that gap is that there is no identifiable individual who is a single point of contact in such cases equivalent to a social worker or care coordinator. The result is that many vulnerable adults with complex needs have no such arrangements in place for contact, collating and sharing of information and deployment of services and assistance, support or safeguarding. Where such arrangements are in place, they are necessarily ad hoc in nature in differing frameworks, levels and standards, and can devolve by default to an individual who, whilst well-motivated, may lack the skills and training to properly perform the function, particularly when the vulnerable adult may be in crisis.","On 1st September 2020, an investigation was commenced into the death of Jordan Peter Clare, aged 22 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 14th October 2022.

15/03/2023,2023-0094,Jai Singh,Emma Brown,Birmingham and Solihull,Suicide (from 2015) | State Custody related deaths,"Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation<br>Trust, NHS England, and Phoenix Partnership Ltd.",https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/jai-singh-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jai-Singh-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0094_Published.pdf,"Jai Singh died at City Hospital on the 28th January 2022 having been admitted after he was found in cardiac arrest in his cell at HMP Birmingham on the 27th January 2022. Mr. Singh had asphyxiated due to placing a bag over his head. He received CPR from prison staff and paramedics and was resuscitated but had suffered irreparable brain and organ damage. 

Mr. Singh had been detained at HMP Birmingham on the 21st September 2021 whilst on remand awaiting trial for the murder of his wife. From the time of his admission Mr. Singh's family were concerned that he was suffering from a severe mental health condition and raised this in numerous emails and telephone calls to safer custody. The content of calls and emails was not recorded on NOMIS casenotes for the information of the custodial team and was not consistently communicated to the mental health team. The information that was passed to the mental health team was not clearly recorded in the SystemOne 
journal for all clinicians to see. Consequently, the opportunity to identify risk and open an ACCT document was missed.

From an early stage Mr. Singh was reporting psychotic behaviour to community psychiatric nurses and was noted to be behaving unusually by custodial staff but he denied any active suicidal or self-harming thoughts. His cellmate and a Chaplain raised concerns about his behaviour but still an ACCT book was not opened.

On the 22nd November 2021 an ACCT book was opened after Mr. Singh reported wanting to kill himself. The ACCT assessment, reviews and care plan were deficient leading to the ACCT being closed prematurely on the 30th November 2021. The post closure process was also inadequate. During the time Mr. Singh was at HMP Birmingham he had a number of welfare checks due to family concerns but these were superficial and perfunctory and never carried out with an interpreter even though Mr. Singh's English was poor. Consequently, his risk was not adequately assessed.

Following an assessment on the 3rd December 2021 a Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist instructed by Mr. Singh's criminal defence team identified that Mr. Singh was suffering with auditory hallucinations, low mood, tiredness and suicidal ideation and made a diagnosis of schizophrenia with an effective element. The Psychiatrist made a referral to a secure inpatient unit, The Hatherton Centre, for a transfer under section 48 of the Mental Health Act. The referral was sent to the Hatherton Centre but was not sent to HMP Birmingham straightaway. The referral to the secure unit was not accepted because it was made by an independent psychiatrist rather than the prison's mental health team. The mental health team at HMP Birmingham were, however, contacted on the 13th December 2021 by a psychiatrist from the Hatherton Centre who stated that there had been a request for assessment for transfer and asked for further information. He was given misleading information that Mr. Singh was ""coping well"" and therefore informed the mental health team that an assessment would not be carried out. No note was made of the conversation with the Hatherton Centre psychiatrist and no action was taken to investigate and pursue a section 48 transfer. The information provided by the independent Consultant Forensic Psychiatrist and the history of psychotic symptoms in SystemOne records ought to have resulted in an assessment by the Hatherton Centre. An assessment would have been likely to result in section 48 transfer. Whilst Mr. Singh remained at HMP Birmingham awaiting transfer he ought to have been under the care of the mental health team and housed on ward 2 (the mental health inpatient wing).

Mr. Singh continued to report that he was hearing voices, hallucinating, struggling to sleep and low in mood. He was reviewed by GPs at the prison on the 29th November, 13th December, 4th January and 25th January who prescribed antidepressants and sleeping medication which Mr. Singh reported were not working.

On the 14th January 2022 a prison Consultant Psychiatrist determined that Jai Singh required urgent admission to the inpatient psychiatric ward for assessment. However, the admission was not facilitated and Mr. Singh remained on a residential wing. The decision not to admit Mr. Singh to the ward was not recorded in his SystemOne records. Mr. Singh received no further input or support from the mental health team. When he was seen by a GP on the 25th January 2022 it was identified that medication was not helping and Mr.Singh needed to be seen by a psychiatrist but the GP thought he was going to be transferred to Ward 2 and therefore took no further action.

All actions taken following Mr. Singh being found in cardiac arrest on the 27th January 2022 were appropriate.

Following a post mortem the medical cause of death was determined to be:

1a Hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage 1b Multi-organ failure
1c Cardio-Pulmonary arrest due to asphyxia","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
1. A multitude of factors contributed to Mr. Singh's death across the custodial and healthcare teams within HMP Birmingham. Many steps have been taken by all organisations with responsibility for Mr. Singh's safety and health during his time at HMP Birmingham to rectify failings that have been identified such as the consistent failure to use interpreters, poor communication and record keeping within and between teams, the absence of meaningful engagement with Mr. Singh's family, insufficient consideration of family concerns and failings in the use of the ACCT system.

2. Much of the evidence at the inquest focused on the central issue of repeated missed opportunities to identify that Mr. Singh required admission to the prison's inpatient ward, ward 2, and assessment for section 48 transfer to a medium secure unit (which would have been likely to result in transfer to a medium secure unit). The consequences of the failure to transfer Mr. Singh to an inpatient setting were compounded by the fact that he was not taken onto the mental health team's caseload promptly and therefore did not have the benefit of an allocated CPN and the oversight and input of a mental health multi-disciplinary team. Many steps have been undertaken by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust (who provide mental health services within the prison) to minimise the risk of such a situation occurring again.

3. However, there are two features of the mental health care provided to Mr. Singh that create a risk to the lives of others that have not yet been rectified:
i.the fact that the mental health team multi-disciplinary team (MDT) does not include a psychiatrist; and
ii.the absence of any ongoing risk assessment documentation for patients with mental illness within the SystemOne records at HMP Birmingham.

4. In Mr. Singh's case it is my conclusion that it is likely that if a psychiatrist had been at a mental health MDT meeting held on the 19th January 2022 they would have identified that he needed to be admitted to ward 2 without further delay. At the very least the need for urgent review by a psychiatrist and CPN would have been recognised and facilitated which would in turn have led to admission. CPNs in Mr. Singh's case continually failed to identify the significance of repeatedly and consistently reported psychotic symptoms and consequently he did not receive adequate assessment and treatment which increased his risk of self harm and suicide which in turn was not sufficiently identified. The absence of a psychiatrist at the MDT creates a risk that the significance of some symptoms and presentations will not be recognised and further deaths could occur due to lack of appropriate assessment and treatment.

5.Other electronic health care records systems used in mental health settings have a rolling risk assessment document that clinicians are required to review and update at certain points in a patient's management. The risk assessment document provides a prompt to clinicians to formally consider risk and come to a reasoned, documented conclusion that then feeds into decision making. The record also provides a reliable, easily accessible source of risk history. No such facility is in use on SystemOne at HMP Birmingham. Further, the evidence given was that such a system is not being used routinely across mental health care within the prison estate and is not provided as standard on SystemOne. This creates an ongoing risk to life arising from under-estimation of risk as a result of clinicians not formally considering and assessing current risk levels, and salient risk history not being easily accessible. It is understood by Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Trust that it should be possible to create a specific risk assessment record within SystemOne and this is being considered locally. However, the evidence given was that this issue should be highlighted nationally and that the developers and distributors of SystemOne should be involved so as to ensure the best available solution is identified.","On 1 February 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jai SINGH. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on the 10th March 2023.
 
The conclusion of the jury at the inquest was;  
Suicide The following matters probably caused or contributed to Mr Singh's death: The failings of safer custody to appropriately communicate and document family concerns to other staff within the prison.The failure to use interpretation services to effectively communicate with Mr Singh by both the custodial and the healthcare teams.

The failure to communicate relevant information within and between the custodial team and the healthcare teamThe failings to appropriately open, re-open and carry out the ACCT process.The failure to carry out sufficient and thorough welfare checks.That Mr Singh did not undergo an assessment for section 48 transfer.

A significant lack of rigor in respect to the completion of official prison and healthcare documentation.
That Mr Singh was not admitted to ward 2 and remained on a residential wing.

In Queen's Hospital, he was diagnosed as suffering from an undisplaced fracture of the pelvis. A decision was taken to treat Mr. Stiff conservatively. Even though there was no surgical intervention, he was admitted under the care of the orthopaedic team. The orthopaedic team are not specialists in controlling medical problems associated with fractures. During the course of the admission, Mr. Stiff's appetite was much reduced. He was not offered any nutritional supplements. On the 15 November 2022 he had reduced oxygen saturations and the medical team became involved in his care. He was diagnosed as suffering from a chest infection. He was treated with supplemental oxygen; intravenous fluids and intravenous antibiotics. Sadly, Mr. Stiff did not recover and he passed away at Queen's Hospital on the 16 November 2022. It is likely that the fall and fractured pelvis on the 10 November 2022 caused a decline in health and mobility which would have contributed to the development of the fatal pneumonia.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
The Inquest heard evidence from an orthopaedic surgeon that patients such as Mr Stiff, who suffer hip and pelvic fractures and who have a number of additional age-related co-morbidities, would be best cared for by ortho- geriatricians. The inquest heard that this matter has been raised by the orthopaedic team on multiple occasions, but the orthogeriatric provision has not been increased.

The Inquest also heard that the lack of orthogeriatric provision is a national issue of concern within the NHS.

Orthopaedic trauma in elderly patients often exacerbates underlying medical conditions. Orthogeriatric trained staff would be better trained to recognise and treat medical co-morbidities. It is therefore considered that improved access to orthogeriatric care for this patient cohort could prevent future untimely deaths.",On 1 December 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of John Edward Stiff.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  
1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:
i.Dorset Lodge is a supported housing accommodation facility with 16 rooms that provides accommodation for those who have drug and alcohol addictions. It is owned and managed by Bournemouth Churches Housing Association (BCHA) and they are contracted to provide the housing to residents by BCP Council. It is staffed Monday to Friday, between 8am to 8pm by two support workers, one covering a shift from 8am to 4pm and the other covering a shift from 12noon to 8pm. When the support staff are unavailable, agency staff will cover the support worker role. On Saturdays a support worker is present, but this is not on a contracted basis and if she is on leave there is no cover. Outside the hours of 8am to 8pm, and on weekends, when there is no support worker on site, there is a night response team who will not be on site but attend twice during the night period to conduct perimeter checks of the building. The premises is covered by CCTV, inside and outside, which can be monitored remotely.

ii.To provide support to the residents, the support workers will undertake key worker sessions which are offered weekly. When agency staff cover the shifts, when the usual support workers are covering other sites or on leave, they do not undertake key worker sessions.

iii.Entry to the premises is gained using a key fob system. Entry is monitored by staff when on site, but between 8pm and 8am, and at weekends when no staff members are on site, residents are able to let people in without any monitoring or safeguarding measures in please.

iv.Evidence was given that those at Dorset Lodge are vulnerable due to their addictions. Mr Drakes' family gave evidence that he had disclosed to them that residents were using drugs within the premises, and they described the times when staff were not present as ""party time"" with non-residents entering the premises. Even when staff are on duty there is no monitoring of who is in the premises, such as by a signing in and out book. Staff undertake welfare checks upon residents 3 times a day at 10.30am, 3.30pm and 7.30pm, however evidence was given that it is not clear who is present at any one time.

v.When the police attended Room 14 at Dorset Lodge on the Thursday 17th November, items of drug paraphernalia were found in the room including needles, a sharps box and a homemade pipe. The room had been insecure from 12th November when Mr Drakes was taken to hospital and there was evidence people had been in the room after that time as items had been removed from the room and residents called the Police to report concerns.

vi.Evidence was given by the family that when they attended the premises on the 14th November they tried to call the number on the front door, which was the out of hours number, and it was a


dead line. Unless a resident allows someone entry, this would be the only route of access to Dorset Lodge by emergency services, such as the paramedics, out of staffed hours to provide care in an emergency, which could delay entry and access to treatment.

vii.Mr Drakes was last seen alive on CCTV at Dorset Lodge at 0.44 hours on the 12th November. Paramedics were called at 16.07 hours that day by other residents. As this was a Saturday, and the support worker who did work some Saturdays was not working that day, there were no welfare checks undertaken upon him by staff. It is not possible to say what would have happened if he had been checked by staff or taken to hospital sooner.

viii. Mr Drakes was deemed to be vulnerable by the manager at Dorset Lodge and there were professional meetings held to discuss, amongst other things, his placement and need for 24 hour support. The last of these professional meetings was held on the 10th August 2022. One was scheduled for the 9thSeptember 2022 but no one was available and the meeting was not rescheduled prior to the 12th November. There was no follow up meeting about his needs after the meeting on the 9thSeptember did not go ahead.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following
i.That there could be the death of a resident at Dorset Lodge under the current processes in place regarding the monitoring, supervision and safeguarding of residents at Dorset Lodge and I would request that consideration is given to reviewing the current levels of staffing and supervision at the placement, and the processes and procedures in place around support to the residents.","On the 8th December 2022, an investigation was commenced into the death of Tarik Roger Drakes, born on the 25th November 1978.

ii.)For the previous 5 years she had been using a Decathlon Easybreath full face snorkel mask when on holiday. 
iii.) On the 13th January 2020 she was snorkelling using the full face mask when she expressed concerns and was accompanied back to the beach. She collapsed and died. 
iv.) Expert evidence at the inquest identified immersion pulmonary oedema as the cause of the death. This is caused by the build-up of fluid in the lungs as a result of an increase in pulmonary capillary pressure caused by water pressure when the chest is submerged. This is exacerbated by hypertension and hormone replacement therapy. Negative pressure in the lungs causes fluid from the blood vessels to be drawn into the lungs. 
v.)The use of a full face snorkel mask contributed to the death in two ways: 
a.) because negative pressure in the lungs is increased as a result of the increased effort of breathing caused by inhalation through the snorkel tube and mask, and 
b.) because respiratory effort is increased by the inhalation of elevated carbon dioxide levels caused by inhaling air drawn through a dead space in the mask.
Both exacerbate the negative pressure in the lungs and increase the effects of immersion pulmonary oedema.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Awareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession:
i.)Concerns were raised by the medical witnesses that there is very little awareness of Immersion Pulmonary Oedema in the medical profession and that it is not addressed in medical training, as a consequence, it can be missed by those treating the condition and is often mistaken for drowning.

The Full Face Mask

ii.) At the time that the Easybreath full face snorkel mask was developed by Decathlon there were no United Kingdom or European Standards which were applicable to a full face snorkelling mask.
iii.) In the course of its development, Decathlon commissioned a number of tests to be undertaken on it, but it was accepted in evidence that the tests undertaken did not replicate the conditions of the use of the mask by the general public.
iv.) Decathlon have sold over 16 million of the masks. Other such masks are also on the market.
v.)The Decathlon usage instructions for the full face mask, contained in small print, have been amended over time. From the 17th August 2015 the instructions included a warning that you must make sure that you are in good physical condition before snorkelling and that the mask is not suitable for swimming.
vi.) Further tests were undertaken and an Ergomedical report considered the issue of whether use of the mask and inhalation through the mask's dead space gave rise to excess carbon dioxide inhalation. The report concluded ""we strongly recommend to advise against wearing Easybreath masks to people who suffer from underlying cardio-respiratory conditions.""
vii.) As a result, Decathlon amended their instructions for use to include that the mask should not be used if the user has unstable cardio-respiratory pathologies, that the mask is to be used under conditions of submaximal exercise (mild to moderate) and that it is not suitable for active swimming.
viii.) Development of a United Kingdom standard in relation to this type of mask is now being put in train but has not yet begun and is likely to take some time.
ix.)Decathlon have recently updated their website in the United Kingdom to include the following, ""It is not recommended to use this product if you have any ongoing respiratory or cardiovascular issues including but not limited to chest infection, asthma, high/raised blood pressure (hypertension), heart disease or angina etc. If you have any doubts or questions relating to this please check with your medical practitioner."" The same additional wording is being translated and added to all websites of the company.
x.)The packaging of the mask has been revised to show a pictogram to warn against use of the mask by those with heart or other cardiovascular conditions.
xi.) The concern is that many million of the full face masks have been sold and the safety concerns about their use by those with ongoing cardiovascular and respiratory issues has not been widely publicised or brought to the attention of those who already own the masks. Those purchased before 2017 had no warning is relation to these matters and the warning included in the instructions from 2017 inwards was not prominent nor sufficient to alert prospective purchasers to the hazards of use which have now been identified.","Following an investigation opened on the 2nd March 2020 and an inquest opened on the 5th March 2020 the inquest was concluded on the 20th December 2022.  

The cause of death was: 
1a.) Immersion Pulmonary Oedema 
II.) Hypertension and Menopause treated by Hormone Replacement Therapy The narrative conclusion was: Angela Jean Kearn was suffering from hypertension and taking hormone replacement therapy. On the 13th January 2020 she was snorkelling using a full face mask. She developed immersion pulmonary oedema and died at the Nile Hospial, Hurghada Egypt. Hypertension, hormone replacement therapy and the use of the full face mask each more than minimally contributed to the death",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 9th May 2023.

She rang the Crisis Team and NHS 111 within 30 minutes of taking the overdose. There were two opportunities missed to send her an ambulance sooner which would on the balance of probabilities have meant her reaching hospital at least two hours earlier than she eventually did.,"During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) Aoife was prescribed propranolol by a locum GP at Burton Croft Surgery on 18thMarch to control the physical symptoms of anxiety by a locum GP at Burton Croft surgery. The prescription comprised 84 tablets (a maximum of three tablets to be taken daily as an as required medication). This was the only occasion on which she was prescribed propranolol.

(2) On the morning on 4th September 2021, when she took her overdose [REDACTED].

(3)On 12th August 2021, in a consultation with another GP at Burton Croft Surgery, Aoife reported that the Propranolol was not helping her and, following discussions and advice, she said she wished to switch to the antidepressant Sertraline, which was prescribed.

(4)In evidence, the GP present at that second consultation agreed that Aoife should have been advised safely to dispose of any propranolol tablets remaining from the earlier prescription by, for example, returning them to a pharmacist. Aoife was not so advised.

(5)Aoife, who by reason of her being prescribed an antidepressant was known to be in a potentially fragile mental state, was left in possession of a significant quantity of a medication known for its potential cardiotoxicity when taken in overdose and which she had stated she no longer wanted or needed.
The primary cause of her death was an overdose of that potentially cardiotoxic medication, which she should not have had in her possession by 4th September 2021.","On 13th September 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Aoife Rose McAdam, aged 19. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on 24th March 2023. The conclusion of the Inquest was that Aoife's death was a misadventure. 

The medical cause of death was 
1a) Cardiac Arrest; 
1b) Intentional Propranolol Overdose; 
2) Anxiety & Mood Disorder. 

The inquest found that the overdose had been taken as an impulsive act, in respect of which Aoife sought help, the provision of which was delayed.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe Burton Croft Surgery (""your organisation"" for the purposes of this report) has the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 24th May 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)
1.There was a lack of awareness of the content of the relevant British Standards, European Standards and International Standards as they relate to the stacking of single deck pallets.
2.The lack of information that is presently passed down the supply chain as to the supply and use of the 'single deck' pallets.

Awareness of British standards
BS EN ISO 445:2013 - Pallets for material handling. Vocabulary provides at 3.2 a description of a single deck flat pallet as one where the lower bearing surface s less than the percentage specified in ISO 6780.
BS ISO 6780:2003 Flat pallets for intercontinental materials handling. Principal dimensions and tolerances - states at 4.6 that the minimum bearing surface requirement for all pallets shall be 35% of the nominal bottom deck plan dimension (pallet footprint).
BS EN 13382:2002 Incorporating Corrigendum No1 Flat Pallets for material handling. Principal Dimensions specifically refers to stacking of single-deck pallets. At 4.6.2 it states: Single deck pallets shall not be stacked.

The Court received evidence that the standards are not freely available and instead a fee is payable to the British Standards Institute in order to access the safety information that the HSE includes in the reference section of Guidance Note PM15 (Fourth Edition). The standards are not legally binding but they are relied upon by the HSE as evidence of best practice.

The HSE should consider increasing awareness of the content of the relevant standards. The HSE should consider updating PM15 to include specific reference to the parts of the relevant standards which contain the safety related information. In particular, the parts that define a single-deck pallet and the suggested prohibition on stacking.

Training
The Road Transport Industry Training Board should consider including the prohibition on stacking single deck pallets as part of the curriculum.

Single deck pallets
Pallets are not currently labelled to indicate whether they should be stacked as a single- deck pallet.

TIMCOM/The Association of Pallet Networks should consider introducing a standardised system to enable easy identification of single deck pallets.","On 23 September 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of John Anthony IBBOTSON aged 57.

Mr John Anthony Ibbotson was 57 years of age who, at the time of his death worked as a warehouse operative at Systagenix Wound Management Ltd, Airebank Mills, Gargrave, Skipton BD23 3RX. He arrived at work at around 06:30 am on Monday 21st September 2020. Sometime thereafter his colleagues went looking for him as he had not been seen for a while. He was found in the raw materials storage, bulk storage area (RMGJ05), this was an area in which he was authorised to work. He was a trained warehouse operative with up-to-date forklift truck training. He was known to be safety conscious and not a risk taker. Mr Ibbotson was found in a sitting position, leaning forward with a pallet on top of his back. The incident was reported to the police at 08:38. The paramedics pronounced lift extinct at 08:53. On balance of probability, it is more likely than not that the pallets were double stacked and not in the pyramid/brick formation, but likely that one pallet was stacked directly on top of the other.

Firstly I must at this time indicate that this is not, nor should be considered as, criticism of the invaluable service that volunteers within the blood bike community provide to the National Health Service.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The samples being transported by Mr Curwen were routine in nature, transported under a contract of courier services, as agreed between the North West Blood Bikes and University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, Southport and Ormskirk Hospitals, Lancashire Teaching Hospital, East Lancashire Hospital Trust and Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust.

During the transfer lights and sirens fitted to the motorcycle provided by the North West Blood Bikes were activated.

The current legislation, as I understand provides exemptions to speed limits and permits the use of the emergency lighting. In terms of those exemptions and permissions it is my understanding that those are subject to:

Speed limits - Emergency vehicles are exempted from speed limits by s.87 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. Sub-sections (1A) and (18) were added to s.87 by s.50(5) of the Deregulation Act 2015. The addition included the words emphasised in bold below.

""87. Exemption of fire brigade, ambulance and police vehicles from speed limits.
(1) No statutory provision imposing a speed limit on motor vehicles shall apply to any vehicle on an occasion when it is being used for fire and rescue authority, ambulance or police purposes, if the observance of that provision would be likely to hinder the use of the vehicle for the purpose for which it is being used on that occasion.

(1A) Subsection (1) above applies in relation to a vehicle that, although not being used for ambulance purposes, is being used for the purpose of providing a response to an emergency at the request of an NHS ambulance service.
{18) In subsection (1A), ""an NHS ambulance service"" means-
(a) an NHS trust or NHS foundation trust established under the National Health Service Act 2006 which has a function of providing ambulance services; ""

Blue lights - The use of blue lights is governed by reg.16 of the Road Vehicles Lighting Regulations 1989/1796, as interpreted by reg.3. Blue warning lights may only be used by
·emergency vehicles"". Again, words were added into this legislation by the Deregulation Act 2015, by Sch.9 para.11(3), including the words emphasised below in bold:

""16. Restrictions on fitting blue warning beacons, special warning lamps and similar devices

(a) a blue warning beacon or special warning lamp, or
(b) a device which resembles a blue warning beacon or a special warning lamp, whether the same is in working order or not.

3. Interpretation ""Emergency vehicle
A vehicle of any of the following descriptions
(aza) a vehicle used for ambulance purposes or for the purpose of providing a response to an emergency at the request of an NHS ambulance service;
(b) an ambulance, being a vehicle (other than an invalid carriage) which is constructed or adapted for the purposes of conveying sick, injured or disabled persons and which is used for such purposes•:

My concerns are fourfold:

1) That the exemptions all relate to actions requiring an emergency response at the request of an NHS ambulance service: 
There appears to be no traceable or auditable co ordination or control of the allocation or dispatch of vehicles by a NHS ambulance trust control centre. Allocation or dispatch appears to be actioned at the request of the four NHS trusts contracted to with North West Blood Bikes under contracts for courier services;

That there is no definition of what constitutes an emergency and in the cases of courier services no apparent auditable or co-ordinated determination of what is classified as an emergency in these cases.
In this instance it was identified that Mr Curwen was transporting blood samples for 5 patients from one hospital to another who provided for weekend cover. There does not appear to be any determination by an NHS Ambulance Trust co-ordinator or control room supervisor, or even a recorded clinical decision as to whether the situation truly requires an ""emergency"" response. It is not suggested at present that the samples were required for life saving treatment, or that delays could significantly reduce the life expectancy of the patients.

3) That there is no auditable or co-ordinated review of the appropriateness of the urgency or emergency nature of the situation: - There does not appear to be any review of the urgency of the situation by control personnel, or continued assessment of the need to apply the exemptions or permissions referred to above.

4) That there is no statutory requirement for training: - There appears to be no statutory requirement for even a basic level of training before using high powered motorcycles and applying the exemptions or permissions, nor does there appear to be any requirement for ongoing or refresher training.

This, as referred to above, is not intended to criticise or demonise the exceptional work that the blood bike charities provide to our National Health Service, but rather to highlight concerns and apparent incongruities in the current legislation. Accordingly I seek clarification as to whether the legislation as it currently stands requires amendment, or a policy/protocol be created, such that Blood Bikes or similar voluntary services do fulfil the criteria to apply liveried markings and emergency lighting and sirens, and would accordingly when responding to ""emergency"" situations would benefit from the exemptions and/or permissions; or that they do not fulfil the criteria and accordingly should not be marked up and fitted with the emergency lights and sirens, and if already fitted, should not use them.",On the 15th May 20181 commenced an investigation into the death of Russell Curwen aged 49.

She was an outpatient under the care of psychiatrists at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton from 7 February 2018 until 20 August 2021. She was noted as not always engaging with medical professionals and disclosed that she had been self-medicating.  

On 20 August 2021, Ms. Findlay was admitted as an inpatient at the Priory Hospital, Roehampton, following a referral from her General Practitioner for ""various complaints"". Ms. Findlay had been taking the anti-depressant venlafaxine but this had resulted in unintended urinary retention and prior to her admission, her intake was being reduced by her treating psychiatrists. On 20 August 2021, following her admission, she was started on a different anti-depressant, vortioxetine and attended to by staff and medical professionals.  

On 27 August 2021, Ms. Findlay discharged herself from the Priory Hospital, Roehampton. This was despite the requests of her treating psychiatrist for her to remain so that her response to her change of medication could be monitored.  

At the time of discharge, no significant risks were identified and Ms. Findlay was deemed to have capacity and was deemed fit for discharge. A discharge plan was put in place.  

The discharge plan for Ms. Findlay included that she was to contact the hospital to make an outpatient appointment. She was also discharged with a week's supply of medication. A discharge summary was sent to her GP.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
Although a discharge plan was implemented in Ms. Findlay's case, it would appear that steps were not taken to contact her emergency contact and/or next of kin, such as to facilitate Ms. Findlay being supported in the community upon discharge. Ms. Findlay, having discharged herself, left the hospital with next of kin/ emergency contacts not being aware of her discharge - despite, her emergency contact being the person who had transported her to the Priory Hospital. No follow up appointment was made prior to Ms. Findlay's discharge and no attempts were made to contact her following her discharge until 6 September 2021.

The matters of concern are as follows:
A. That no contact was made with next of kin/ emergency contacts prior to, or at the time of her release.
B. No follow up appointment was booked prior to Ms. Findlay's discharge.
No attempt was made to contact Ms. Findlay until 6 September 2021 (some 10 days following her discharge).","On 27 September 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Annabel Jean Findlay who died aged 56 years' old. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 1 March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was a short-form conclusion of suicide.

He suffered with epileptic seizures for which he was prescribed medication, and he had difficulty swallowing. At the time of his death, he was a resident at Rosewood House in Launceston which provided supported living for individuals with physical and/or mental disadvantages. 

On 21/4/21, he was given prescribed medication with a chocolate milkshake at about 20:00. He was checked upon subsequently before being found unresponsive at about 23:30. CPR was initiated during the course of which an unsealed, partly-consumed chocolate bar was seen under or near his bed.  Lugh had a care plan that mandated he should not eat unsupervised and should eat sitting up. It is not known how the chocolate bar came to be found where it was. It is further not known if Lugh had been eating it immediately prior to his death.  

Lugh could not be resuscitated. A post-mortem examination did not reveal evidence of airway obstruction. The evidence did not further or fully explain the means whereby the cause of death arose.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
i) I heard evidence at inquest that all residents were constantly monitored yet I found as fact that there were times when this did not happen for Lugh. I was informed that a new system has been put in place requiring staff to sign a form indicating the periods in time when they were responsible for monitoring residents. I asked for evidence to demonstrate this (a completed form) and for confirmation that, where there were any gaps in monitoring, these were explained on the form.

ii) Concern was raised that Care Plans for new residents were not reviewed sufficiently promptly. I asked to see a policy document setting out the expectation for healthcare professionals for how long it should take for a new resident's Care Plan to be reviewed after admission.

iii) Concern was also raised about what steps will be taken, and when, where a new resident with an unusual presentation is admitted. In this case, Lugh had a diagnosis of Angelman's syndrome with which staff were unfamiliar. Again, I asked to see a policy document setting out what training or other steps will now be taken in such circumstances and by when.","On 13/3/23, I concluded an inquest into the death of Lugh Baker.

""On 18.7.21 Charlotte Comer, who lived with a number of significant mental health disorders, including Body Dysmorphic Disorder, and had a known history of attempts at suicide and self-harm, left Worcestershire Royal Hospital before doctors there could treat a substantial, recently self-inflicted wound to her upper arm. She returned initially to her parents' home, before then making her way to her own address in Worcester, where she proceeded to take a substantial overdose of Propranolol and Amlodipine medication. She was taken by ambulance back to Worcestershire Royal Hospital where, despite treatment, she succumbed to the effects of the overdose and died on the morning of 20.7.21.""","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) During the 2½ years in which Charlotte's mental health care was provided by the Trust, she had total of 8 different care coordinators. Furthermore, in those 2½ years there was a 5 month period when Charlotte had no appointed care coordinator at all. The care coordinator role is particularly important for a patient with such a complex case history as Charlotte.

I heard evidence that at the time of these events, the Trust had been experiencing an unprecedented level of instability, with many staff who might have been expected to fulfil care coordinator roles going off sick or even leaving the service. The witness who had conducted the Trust's own internal investigation into these events gave evidence that one of the major reasons for this instability was that staff were unable to cope with ever-increasing workloads. The Trust's Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams appeared to corroborate this in his evidence, confirming that whilst national guidelines recommend a maximum of 30 patients per care coordinator, at the time of these events the Trust's care coordinators had around 100 patients each. Whilst he was able to provide some reassurance that a recent recruitment drive has reduced individual care coordinator caseloads to around 25 patients, he was unable to explain how individual caseloads had been able to reach the levels they did at the time of these events, and was unable to give accurate figures as to current levels of staff sickness/absence.

I am concerned that the Trust is unable to understand fully how the care coordinator system failed at the time of these events, and that it is therefore not in a position to guard against a repeat of these circumstances in the future.

(2) The erroneous decision to pause Charlotte's referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder was taken by a senior clinician acting on her own, despite a Multi-Disciplinary Team meeting having decided that the referral was appropriate. When asked about how the senior clinician could have overridden the MDT decision, the Trust's Community Services manager for the Worcestershire Neighbourhood Teams told the inquest that he could not say whether the senior clinician was not aware of the correct decision-making procedure, or whether she was, but chose instead to ignore it. When asked whether the same issue could arise in future, he told the inquest that he himself would be in a position to prevent the senior clinician making the wrong decision, but could not guarantee that he would be made aware of the issue so as to be able to do so.

I am concerned that the Trust has not properly established how the senior clinician was able to override the MDT decision, and does not have a sufficiently robust system in place to ensure that MDT decisions cannot be overridden in this way in future.","[the details below are fictional]  
On 27 July 2021 I commenced an investigation and opened an inquest into the death of Charlotte Comer. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 17 February 2023.  
The conclusion of the inquest was as follows:  

""Charlotte Comer died as the result of suicide. The following failings on the part of the Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust ( 'the Trust' ) probably caused or contributed to her death: (a) The erroneous decision at the beginning of 2021 to seek to pause Charlotte's referral to the Priory Hospital for specialist treatment for Body Dysmorphic Disorder; (b) The high turnover of care coordinators for Charlotte whilst she was under the Trust's care, together with a five month period when she was without a care coordinator at all, which led to a loss of awareness on the Trust's part about the seriousness and complexity of Charlotte's needs; and (c) The failure by the Trust to provide sufficient focus on the important issue of Charlotte's Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Charlotte's death was contributed to by neglect.""","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you, as Chief Executive of the Herefordshire & Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust,

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)  
The SystemOne computer programme used by the GP Practice can, when a clinician is reviewing the results (blood) from the laboratory with the screen in minimised mode (which is not unusual because of a need to work with a split screen), not show all the results. To do so would need the clinician to scroll down and a scroll feature is not available. This gives rise to the risk of an abnormal result being missed and unactioned.

Abnormal (out of range) should be more visable - appear at the top of a list and colour coded to minimise the risk of a result not being seen / missed. The computer programme prevents this.","On 05 January 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jade Paula REVELL aged 30. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 March 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:  

Jade Revell was taken to Chesterfield Royal Hospital on 25 December 2021 having suffered a sudden cardiac event at home. Despite extensive resuscitation she passed away in hospital the same day.  

Jade suffered with an eating disorder and was under the care of the mental health team. Prior to making a change to her medication her bloods were tested. On 27 October 2021 the bloods were electronically sent to Jade's GP practice. These showed a low potassium level which required further action.  

There was a failure to notify Jade of this result. This caused a missed opportunity to medically treat the hypokalaemia and monitor the potassium levels which increased the risk of ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 17, 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
Evidence I heard at these inquests revealed that numerous recommendations arising from previous inquiries and reviews regarding the training of police officers and police staff involved in firearms licensing decisions had not been put into effect. This is not a new concern but one that has previously been raised by at least two other coroners in earlier 'Prevention of Future Deaths' reports in other coronial jurisdictions. If any lessons had been learned in the aftermath of earlier tragedies, they have been forgotten and that learning had been lost.

I was told that all Chief Officers of police ought to be satisfied that they only delegate their authority to issue and revoke firearms and shotgun licences to appropriately trained and skilled personnel. However, over the past 27 years, there has been an abject failure to ensure that nationally accredited training of firearms licensing staff has been developed and its currency maintained. Specifically -

1. In 1996, following the murders at the primary school in Dunblane Lord Cullen's report (see here) recommended as follows:

'Enquiry officers should be given as much training and guidance for their work as is practicable.'

The Government responded (see here) stating that

""The Government accepts this recommendation. Existing Home Office advice to police forces is that 'enquiry, administration and decision making processes' in each police force should all be controlled by a centralised firearms administration and that all inquiries should be made by nominated, trained staff. The Guidance to the Police will be amended to emphasise the point.""

In fact the guidance subsequently issued by the Home Office, in March 2002, entitled 'Firearms Law, Guidance to the Police', (here) made no recommendation regarding the training of staff. The 2002 guidance merely stated (at §1.5)

'Firearms legislation and the subject of firearms generally is complex and highly specialised. It is not practicable to provide comprehensive training for every police officer on the administration of the Firearms Acts. It is therefore essential that this guide is available to all police officers and civilians directly involved in the licensing process. Where difficulties arise, advice may be sought from the firearms department at the appropriate police force.'

Indeed by March 2002 there was no accredited training for the role of firearms enquiry officers (FEOs) or firearms licensing managers (FLMs). The Home Office guidance to police did not contain any proposal or requirement that FEOs or FLMs should undergo training specific to their role. There was no requirement that FEOs or FLMs should undergo any training in assessing the suitability of applicants to be granted a licence.

2.Later in 2002 The Firearms Licensing Thematic Review entitled 'Safe Hands = Secure Arms' (here), conducted by Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary (HMIC) recommended as follows:

'Recommendation 2.
Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary recommends that force policy and procedure in respect of firearms licensing should mirror Lord Cullen's Recommendations and ACPO Policy, Home Office Guidance and ACPO, 'Procedural Good Practice Guide'.

Recommendation 3.
Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary recommends that forces ensure that staff conducting firearms enquiries are trained, conversant with current ACPO
/Home Office guidance and competent to fulfil their role.'

However, despite those recommendations the absence of formal training courses for FELU staff in firearms licensing remained unaddressed.

3.In March 2013 the Senior Coroner for Durham issued a report under rule 43 Coroners Rules 1984 following the inquests into the deaths of Sam McGoldrick, Alison Turnbull, Tanya Turnbull and Michael Atherton:

The r.43 report, sent to the Chief Constable of Durham Police and the Home Secretary raised the following concern (among others):

'The inquest has revealed disturbing issues on the question of training. Notwithstanding the significant importance of the shotgun firearms licencing process there was no formal training courses available in 2006/2008 and even limited formal training available now. Training was by virtue of learning on the job and by making enquiries oneself and familiarising oneself with the Home Office and ACPO guidance. Durham Constabulary did not have its own local policy relating to firearms/shotgun licencing. Durham Constabulary was not alone in not having such a policy. Not all individuals involved in the licencing process were aware of the existence of the Home Office and ACPO guidance documents, both published in 2002, let alone the detailed contents thereof…. This case has illustrated that the administration of firearms shotgun licencing system was… unclear on occasion and confusing. And with the absence of training and clear guidance either locally or nationally, it created an environment in which it was easier for less than optimal standards to be achieved.'

The Home Secretary (The Rt Hon Theresa May MP) responded on 17 June 2013 stating that:
'Nationally a recognised training course is available for firearms enquiry officers and a system of mentoring uses the expertise of more experienced enquiry officers or managers.'

If it was indeed the case that a national training course for course for firearms enquiry officers was available as the Home Secretary suggested in June 2013 this was no longer the case by 2014. I have been informed that in 2014 there was still no nationally accredited training available for the role of FEOs or FLMs. The College of Policing Authorised Professional Practice (APP) in 2014 (see here at section 2.6) merely stated that chief police officers should be 'seeking to develop appropriate accredited training for firearms licensing staff.'

Furthermore the Home Office guidance published in 2014 still did not contain any proposal or requirement that FEOs or FLMs should undergo any (even non-accredited) training specific to their role. In particular, there was no requirement that FEOs or FLMs should undergo any training in assessing the suitability of applicants to be granted a licence.

4. In September 2015, HMIC conducted another 'inspection of the efficiency and effectiveness of firearms licensing in police forces in England and Wales' entitled 'Targeting the Risk' (see here).

This report yet again raised concerns at the continuing absence of nationally accredited training for firearms licensing decision makers. The HMIC report stated that:

'While some training has been made available, we are concerned at the continuing absence of nationally accredited training. Its absence has meant that some staff involved in the licensing arrangements, in particular those charged with making firearms licensing decisions, have yet to receive sufficient training, commensurate with their role and responsibility.'

HMIC noted in 2015 that proposals for accredited training were 'under consideration' by the national policing lead for firearms licensing and the College of Policing. However, the evidence I heard at the inquest was that this 'consideration' did not result in any accredited training being developed. Even today, some eight years later, accredited training for those charged with making firearms licensing decisions does not exist.

In 2015 HMIC recommended to the national policing lead for firearms licensing, in conjunction with the College of Policing that:

'Within 12 months, the national policing lead for firearms licensing, in conjunction with the College of Policing, should identify the skills required by those staff involved in the firearms licensing process. Thereafter they should introduce professional development arrangements to ensure a consistent national approach to firearms licensing. Consideration should also be given to the accreditation of these arrangements.'

That 2015 HMIC report also stated that
'On too many occasions, the police are not following the Home Office guidance or the Authorised Professional Practice. And, the guidance and practice in many respects are inadequate, allowing room for interpretation and the creation of inconsistency in the way firearms licensing is undertaken within and between police forces….

We cannot make our position any clearer: it is now for others to accept the need for change. If they do, perhaps the life of the next victim of firearms misuse might be saved. What is highly likely is that, if change is not effected, there will be another tragedy.

The Home Office guidance on firearms licencing was subsequently updated in 2016. However, that guidance made no reference to the need for firearms licencing staff to undergo accredited training. The 2016 Home Office guidance did not contain any proposal or requirement that FEOs or FLMs should undergo any (even non-accredited) training specific to their role. There was no requirement that FEOs or FLMs should undergo any training in assessing the suitability of applicants to be granted a licence.
Evidence presented at the inquests was that the College of Policing's Coordination and Delivery Group had declined requests made to it to develop a national training package in Feb 2016 and January 2019.

5. In 2019 Mr Richard Travers Senior Coroner for Surrey issued a report to prevent future deaths following the killings of Christine and Lucy Lee (see here).

That report, which was sent to Chief Constable of Surrey Police, the NPCC lead for firearms and the Home Office, raised the following concern:

'It was apparent from the evidence that, at the time of the deaths, there was no national training course for staff working in police firearms licensing departments as Firearms Enquiry Officers (""FEOs""). I was told that work is now being undertaken by the College of Policing to produce an accreditation process for FEOs, but that this work is not yet complete.

Currently, what is known as ""the South Yorkshire Training Course"" is available. This is a five day, residential course which appears to be comprehensive. I was told that all Surrey Police's current FEOs have completed the South Yorkshire Training Course, but that it is not mandatory for them to do so.

I am concerned that, pending the introduction of a full accreditation scheme, the absence of a mandatory requirement for all new FEOs (whether in Surrey or elsewhere) to undertake comprehensive training for the role, in the form of the South Yorkshire Training Course or equivalent, will result in the risk of insufficient training, incorrect decision making concerning certification and, consequently, future deaths.'

By 2021, when Jake Davison's gun was returned to him, there was still no accredited training for the role of FEOs or FLMs, nor was there any mandatory requirement for FEOs or FLMs to undergo even non-accredited training specific to their role. In particular, there was no requirement that FEOs or FLMs to undergo any training in assessing the suitability of applicants to be granted a licence.

It is against this background of 27 years of wholesale failure to devise and maintain adequate training provision for firearms licensing staff nationally that the jury in the Keyham inquests returned their findings above, including that:

'There was a serious failure at a national level by the government, Home Office and National College of Policing to implement the recommendation from Lord Cullen's Report in 1996 arising out of the fatal shootings in Dunblane, to provide training for FEOs and the subsequent recommendation in Her Majesty's Inspectorate of the Constabulary's Targeting the Risk Report in 2015 for an accredited training regime for FEOs. The most recent statutory guidance from the Home Office (2021) has failed to include any mention of FEO specific training.

The training and informal mentoring available at Devon & Cornwall police was insufficient to enable the FEOs to safely discharge their duties, meaning incorrect processes were perpetuated and not formally recorded as an agreed training method to deliver learning outcomes.'

The evidence I heard suggested the absence of training was not merely a local problem for Devon & Cornwall Police. I have been assured that work towards an accredited training package is now ongoing and I was also informed that that some police forces, do currently have in-house training programmes that firearms licensing staff from other forces may attend. However I have been informed that the availability of such local in-house training remains sporadic.

I am concerned that there is an urgent need to develop a national accredited training for FELU staff that covers how to apply the relevant Home Office Guidance on firearms licencing including, in particular, training in assessing the suitability of applicants to be granted a licence. The development of such accredited training is vitally important to achieve consistency and drive up standards.

I am concerned that there is currently no requirement or guidance that FELU staff should undergo mandatory training. I am also concerned that there is currently no requirement that Chief Officers of Police may only delegate decision making authority regarding issuing firearms licences to a person who has undergone adequate training.

Whilst I acknowledged that the current NPCC lead for firearms licencing is now working with the College of Policing and others to develop the required training, I am concerned to ensure that the momentum to effect change after the horrific tragedy in Keyham should not be lost, as it has been in respect of lessons and recommendations over the past 27 years.

I am therefore reporting the matters above to:

The NPCC lead for firearms licencing and all other Chief Constables in England and Wales
So that each Chief Constable is made aware of my concern that, that despite the many recommendations made over the past 27 years, there continues to be a lack of nationally accredited training for their FELU staff.

I also report my concern that in the absence of such the training there is a risk that the Statutory Guidance is not being appropriately applied by FELU staff today, and so each Chief Constable may need to take steps to satisfy themselves that (i) adequate local training, of a satisfactory standard has been universally delivered to all their FELU staff and supervisors in applying the Home Office Guidance on Firearms Licencing Law (published in November 2022) and the revised Statutory Guidance for Chief officers of Police (published in February 2023) and (ii) they have only delegated decision making to persons who have undergone adequate training in firearms licencing and in applying that recent Guidance.

The College of Policing (CoP)
So that the College of Policing is made aware of my concern that
(1) despite the repeated recommendations being made over the past 27 years, and the earlier requests made specifically to the College of Policing asking for such training to be developed, no accredited training as yet exists.
(2) neither the current CoP APP guidance on firearms nor the proposed update (which I am aware is still under consultation) includes any requirement that FELU staff are trained in firearms licencing generally or trained in conducting suitability assessments in particular.

The Home Secretary and The Minister of State for Crime, Policing and Fire
So that they may be made aware of my concern that despite the repeated recommendations being made over the past 27 years, beginning with the Cullen report in 1996:

(i)successive governments appear to have failed to ensure that any guidance is produced that makes having training in firearms licencing generally (and in conducting suitability assessments in particular) mandatory for all FELU staff;
(ii)there appears to be no requirement that Chief Officers of Police should only delegate authority to issue and revoke licences to officers and staff who have completed adequate (and preferably nationally accredited) training.

I am concerned that the lack of accredited training combined with the absence of a mandatory requirement for all those making firearms licensing decisions to undertake adequate training for their role increases the risk of incorrect decision making and, consequently, increases the risk of future deaths.","On 19 August 2021 I commenced an investigation into the deaths of Maxine Davison (age 51), Lee Martyn (age 43), Sophie Martyn (age 3), Stephen Washington (age 59) and Kate Shepherd (age 66). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest held before a jury on 20 February 2023. The conclusion of the jury in respect of these five conjoined inquests was as follows:  

Maxine Betty Davison 
On the 12th August 2021 between 18:05-18:08, Maxine Betty Davison died as a result of shotgun wounds to the head and torso. This occurred at her address, 17 Biddick Drive following an argument with the perpetrator.  

Lee Raymond John Martyn 
On the 12th August 2021 between 18:08-18:10, Lee Raymond John Martyn died as a result of shotgun wounds to the head and torso. This occurred whilst walking with his daughter Sophie Iris Martyn in the street, Biddick Drive, Keyham, Plymouth.  

Sophie Iris Martyn 
On the 12th August 2021 between 18:08-18:10, Sophie Iris Martyn died as a result of a shotgun wound to her head. This occurred whilst walking with her father Lee Raymond John Martyn in the street, Biddick Drive, Keyham, Plymouth.

Stephen John Godfrey Washington
On the 12th August 2021 between 18:10-18:12, Stephen John Godfrey Washington died as a result of a shotgun wound to his chest. This occurred whilst walking on Snakey path (Linear Park), a footpath behind Biddick Drive, Keyham, Plymouth whilst walking his dogs.

Kathryn Jane Shepherd (known as Kate).
On the 12th August 2021, Kathryn Jane Shepherd received a shotgun wound to her abdomen at 18:13 outside Blush Salon, Henderson Place, Plymouth and subsequently died later that day in Derriford Hospital, Plymouth.

In respect of each deceased the jury also found as follows
Under Section 3 of the Record of Inquest
'The perpetrator came to be and remain in lawful possession of a shotgun at the material time due to the following circumstances:

The initial shotgun licence application
In 2017, given the absence of medical information, the known history of assaults and the intelligence held by Devon & Cornwall Police suggesting involvement in other violent episodes, it was a serious failure to protect the public and the peace to grant a licence to the perpetrator.

There was a serious failure within the Firearms and Explosives Licensing Unit (FELU) to heed and apply the 2016 Home Office guidance, that high risk decisions on grant of a licence should be made by the Firearms Licensing Manager (FLM).

Despite the 2016 Home Office guidance in force at that time, inadequate steps were taken to obtain specific medical evidence regarding the extent to which the perpetrator's declared autism and Asperger's might impact upon his suitability to hold a shotgun licence.

This was further compounded by the confusion caused by the move from the use of a post to pre-grant letter, without the update to the Home Office guidance which previously stated would be provided.

It was not a safe system to assume that in the absence of a substantive response to the standard pre-grant letter from the GP, there were no relevant medical conditions that could affect the perpetrator's suitability to hold a shotgun licence.

The mechanism agreed by the FLM and Local Medical Committee to obtain specific factual information about a self-declared medical condition was not communicated to or followed by the Firearms Enquiry Officer (FEO) or the Firearms Licencing Supervisor (FLS).

The referee's tasks and responsibilities were not made clear and insufficient inquiries were made of the referee given the known history of assaults at school.

Reflecting the culture within the FELU at the time, an insufficient degree of professional curiosity was demonstrated by the FEO and FLS.

The review of the licence
The decision to return the shotgun and licence to the perpetrator in July 2021 was fundamentally flawed and as a result failed to protect the public and the peace.

The officer investigating the skate park assaults in September 2020 should have noted that the perpetrator was a firearms certificate holder and taken immediate steps to alert the FELU to the incident.

It was unreasonable to categorise the level of the assault upon the boy in the skate park as battery. There were clear aggravating factors to suggest this should have been charged at a higher level and there was inadequate investigation of whether the assault on the boy in the skate park had led to his unconsciousness.

The use of the Pathfinder scheme in this instance was wholly inadequate in reducing the perpetrator's future offending.

On reviewing the perpetrator's suitability to retain the shotgun certificate, the FEO ought to have shown a greater degree of professional curiosity in obtaining and evaluating further information. The case was not passed to the FLM for review which was against Home Office guidance.

General
There was a serious failure at a national level by the government, Home Office and National College of Policing to implement the recommendation from Lord Cullen's Report in 1996 arising out of the fatal shootings in Dunblane, to provide training for FEOs and the subsequent recommendation in Her Majesty's Inspectorate of the Constabulary's Targeting the Risk Report in 2015 for an accredited training regime for FEOs. The most recent statutory guidance from the Home Office (2021) has failed to include any mention of FEO specific training.

The training and informal mentoring was insufficient to enable the FEOs to safely discharge their duties. Informal mentoring had inherent limitations, meaning incorrect processes were perpetuated and not formally recorded as an agreed training method to deliver learning outcomes.

There was a catastrophic failure in the management of the FELU, with a lack of managerial supervision, inadequate and ineffective leadership. This was compounded by a lack of senior management and executive leadership who failed to notice or address the issues.

There was a lack of scrutiny and professional curiosity at all levels. The ineffective auditing and governance of the FELU in place led to an inadequate system of dip sampling, qualitative assessment of staff's decision-making, and learning from the results of the same.

There was a seriously unsafe culture within the FELU of defaulting to granting licences and to returning licences after review.
There was a dangerous lack of understanding on the part of the Devon and Cornwall Police FELU staff regarding the use and application of the FELU risk matrix.

Incompatible IT systems both within Devon and Cornwall Police and outside agencies contributed to a failure to communicate effectively.

Budgetary limitations and staff shortages within Devon and Cornwall Police increased the probability of risk being incorrectly assessed which led to unsafe licences being issued.
These limitations were not confined to Devon and Cornwall Police but also existed at a national level, for example the National College of Policing not assigning resources to run
an accredited national FEO training course.'


The jury's conclusion in respect of each death under Section 4 of the Record of Inquest was as follows:
'The deceased was unlawfully killed.

The death was caused by the fact that the perpetrator had a lawfully held shotgun. The following contributed to this position.

There were serious failures by Devon and Cornwall Police FELU in granting and, later, failing to revoke the perpetrator's shotgun certificate.

In licencing the perpetrator to have a shotgun there was a serious failure by Devon and Cornwall Police to protect the deceased.

There was a failure of Devon and Cornwall Police to have in place safe and robust systems. Foremost, the training of FELU staff, governance of the FELU, quality assurance of FELU staff's decision-making and ensuring decisions were made at the correct level.

There was a failure by Devon and Cornwall Police FELU staff to obtain sufficient medical information in respect of the perpetrator's application for a shotgun certificate and also on review.

There was a failure by Devon and Cornwall Police FELU staff to properly seek out and consider all the relevant evidence and information available before deciding whether to grant the perpetrator a shotgun certificate.

Following the perpetrator having assaulted two children in 2020, there was a failure by Devon and Cornwall Police to protect the public and the peace. Firstly, within the Local Investigation team regarding the downgraded charge and secondly, within the FELU to sufficiently investigate whether it was safe to return to the perpetrator his shotgun and certificate after initially seizing them.

Incorrect application of the risk matrix meant there was a serious failure by Devon and Cornwall Police to implement an adequate system to ensure that the decision whether or not to (i) grant or (ii) return a shotgun certificate following review, was made or approved by a manager of sufficient seniority.

A lack of national accredited Firearms licensing training has and continues to fail to equip police staff to protect the public safety.

There was a catastrophic failure in the management of the FELU, with a lack of managerial supervision, inadequate and ineffective leadership. This was compounded by a lack of senior management and executive leadership who failed to notice or address the issues.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 3 May 2023.

At 4.06 am Mr Adams contacted the ambulance service to explain that he had fallen, injured his scalp and that he could not stop the bleeding. Mr Adams' call was triaged using the Medical Priority Despatch System, which resulted in a disposition of 17-b-01: fall possible dangerous area. This translated to a category 3 ambulance response. The national target set by the Department of Health is to attend category 3 incidents within 120 minutes on at least 90% of occasions (so by 6.13 am), with an average response time of 60 minutes (by 5.13am). At the time of this call, Mr Adams appeared well with no additional symptoms. Mr Adams had also activated his careline, which is an element of the support provided by the housing association. At 7.53 an operator from the careline contacted Mr Adams to check on his welfare. Mr Adams reported that he was now feeling sick, that he was wobbly when stood up and that his bleeding was continuing. The careline operator contacted the ambulance service and advised of the new symptoms. A further triage was conducted, with the same disposition of fall, possibly dangerous area being reached, as the algorithm being used failed to account for the persistent nature of the bleeding being experienced and that Mr Adams was prescribed clopidogrel. At 10.25 Mr Adams again spoke to a careline operator. He was by now slurring his words and his speech was noticeably slow. It is likely he was experiencing symptoms associated with hypovolaemic shock. If Mr Adams had received treatment by 10.25, he would have survived the injury he had sustained. The first ambulance resource arrived at Mr Adams' property at 11.56, by which time a neighbour had found Mr Adams when Mr Adams had called for his help. Mr Adams was conveyed to Dorset County Hospital, where despite treatment he died on 19thOctober 2021.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:
i. A patient, prescribed either antiplatelet or anticoagulant medication, falling and sustaining a scalp laceration that is not ""spurting or pouring blood"" (the MPDS definition of ""uncontrolled bleeding""), will never reach an MPDS disposition that results in a prioritisation higher than category 3, regardless of how long the bleeding has been persisting, unless the patient becomes unconscious or stops breathing. I heard evidence that the scalp is an area of high venous blood flow, such that a laceration to the scalp is capable of bleeding significantly. However, because of the nature of the blood supply in this area, the wound will not ""spurt or pour"" blood, so with the current iteration of MPDS a wound in this area of the body can never be considered as ""serious haemorrhage"". Despite this, when assessing the seriousness of a bleed that does not meet the criteria for a ""serious haemorrhage"", the MPDS algorithm does not allow for consideration of any delay in treatment or for the consideration of medications that may either exacerbate the extent of a bleed or prevent the blood from clotting to stop the bleed. For a patient such as Mr Adams, prescribed antiplatelet medication, there is a considerable risk that the bleeding will persist until the wound is closed, such that a delay in receiving treatment, where the wound continues to bleed, leaves the patient at risk of developing hypovolaemic shock.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:
i. Where a patient on anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy sustains a fall and scalp laceration, the questions forming the MPDS protocol designed to assess the seriousness of the bleed and the prioritisation of an ambulance resource do not allow for consideration of the period of the time the bleeding has persisted from an area of high vascular blood flow or the medication prescribed. Therefore, in circumstances where the bleeding has persisted for a considerable time and where there is no evidence of the bleeding stopping, it seems the MPDS disposition reached would always be 17-b-01, with a consequent category 3 priority, which does not account for the increasing seriousness of the patient's predicament and the potential consequences of the continued blood loss.","On the 5th November 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Kenneth Michael Adams, born on the 2l5t August 1951. The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 9th March 2023. 

The Medical Cause of Death was: 
la Hypoxic brain damage 
lb Cardiac arrest 
le Profuse bleeding from a laceration of the scalp  
2 Treatment with clopidogrel for stenosing atherosclerosis of carotid arteries   

The conclusion of the Inquest recorded that Kenneth Michael Adams died as a consequence of an accident to which a failure to provide emergency medical assistance in a timely manner more than minimally contributed. A failure of the Medical Priority Despatch System to acknowledge and assess persistent bleeding from a scalp injury against a background of anti-platelet medication also possibly contributed to his death.",In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you and/or your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, 17th May 2023.

Although I heard evidence about her attendance at the day assessment unit ('DAU') the day before the birth, and about her neonatal management, the focus of the inquest was on her labour management from the time of her admission to the labour ward at 03:45 on 9th May. Her care by a band 6 agency midwife from that time until shift change at around 7am was the focus of the investigation. 

I found in evidence that this midwife: 
1. Failed to recognise a pathological trace. Both the trust's internal investigation and the report of an independent expert concluded that it should have been classified as pathological from 06:40 hours. This was largely because of reduced variability.  

2. Conducted so called 'fresh eyes' reviews herself for this patient, rather than asking a colleague to do so. The reasons she gave for this significant, repeated and undocumented deviation from policy were inconsistent with the rest of the evidence, and I found them unlikely to be true.  

3. Recorded the maternal rather than fetal heart rate for part of the trace. My understanding is that this can happen (briefly) even in experienced hands, but this was not recognised at the time by the midwife. 

4. Did nothing to escalate or investigate the mother's high pulse rate. 

5. Did not take regular temperature readings, despite spontaneous rupture of membranes happening some hours before, when Mrs Rizwan was admitted to the DAU and was given paracetamol for a raised temperature.

Raniya was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital on 15th May 2020, when her condition deteriorated. Despite extensive consideration and re-consideration of all relevant treatment options, Raniya died at Great Ormond Street Hospital on 28th May 2020.

I concluded that earlier delivery was unlikely to have changed the outcome. Despite extensive investigation (including genetic investigations) at a very senior level, it has not been possible to identify the cause of Raniya's pulmonary hypertension.","I sent a regulation 28 report to this trust on 20th June 2022, in relation to the death of a 6-day old baby born at Royal Berkshire Hospital on 26th June 2020. The circumstances of that case are different from these, but midwifery training and placenta retention are issues common to both cases.

Placenta retention
In their response to my previous Regulation 28 report, the trust said :

Previously, placentas in uncomplicated cases were being disposed of on a daily basis but I can confirm that the trust have implemented processes to ensure that all placentas are stored for 48 hours from the time of birth. We are advised by the pathology team that retaining placentas beyond this time would not provide reliable histology findings.

In practical terms, placenta fridges have now been placed in the delivery suite and birth centre, and homebirth placentas will be placed in the birth centre fridge (the homebirth operating procedures have been updated to reflect this). Tutela monitors are operating in the fridges, which provide connected automated monitoring and alerts the clinical areas if there are any concerns with the temperature of the fridge.

The Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for placenta retention will be ratified at the Maternity Clinical Governance Meeting in October 2022 and will go live on 10th October 2022; it provides guidance on which placentas need to be sent to histology for pathological examination, as well as storing and retaining all placentas for 48 hours before disposal in uncomplicated cases. In order to disseminate this information, all of the trust's band 7 midwives and unit coordinators will be trained on the new SOP to ensure compliance throughout maternity, and in particular the midwives and community support workers. We are also working with waste management to ensure that their team are fully aware of the new processes, as they now need to request that a member of the midwifery team attends with them to ensure the correct procedures are followed.

As an additional assurance, the safety huddle templates on our electronic patient system will be updated to prompt the team to ask whether any babies have deteriorated or been admitted from other areas in the last 24 hours to the pediatric wards, who are less than 48 hours of age and require ventilation, cooling or neonatal death. This measure will be introduced to ensure that placentas are not erroneously disposed of due to lack of communication between the maternity unit and pediatric ward.

It was surprising in the extreme to be made aware in open court on the final day of this inquest that these undertakings have not in fact been completed - the system referred to above is not in place, there is no SOP, nor has there been any staff training. It was particularly disappointing to hear this in front of a family who had themselves lost a baby and who were being reassured of how committed the trust is to improvement.

Midwifery training and management
I was also advised that there has been no approach made to NHS Professionals about concerns with the midwife in question. Similarly, no approach to the NMC has been made.

It is fair to recognise that this trust is focused on improving obstetric and midwifery care, and they have increased their training and staffing - to include appointing a director of midwifery. Changes have been made regarding induction of agency staff. It seems likely that individual people in these new posts have a clear desire to improve the service and are themselves somewhat frustrated that these changes have not yet been made.

I would ask therefore that the trust respond within the requisite 56 days (at the latest) in relation to the following issues:

1.The current position with regard to :
a. Storage of all placentas for 48 hours, and SoP around this
b. Review of policies and staff awareness regarding mandatory sending of placentas for pathological examination.

2.Training and awareness regarding these new policies - to include practical arrangements around ensuring a placenta is retrieved and sent to histology subsequently if needed.

3. The trust should refer concerns about this individual agency midwife as a matter of urgency both NHS Professionals, and to the Nursing and Midwifery Council. This is in addition to raising of the possibility of an individual 'passport' to prevent a midwife moving between agencies to work elsewhere after significant concerns have been raised.","I conducted an inquest into death of Raniya Rizwan Khan at Reading Town Hall, which concluded on 9th February 2023. I recorded a conclusion of natural causes.

Before he was employed as a proof assistant testing new guns, Mr Roberts' prospective employer asked for a DBS (Disclosure and Barring Service) certificate. This was provided and recorded no convictions, cautions, reprimands or warnings.

However, Mr Roberts had in the past been convicted of a violent offence for which he had received a custodial sentence. This was the reason for his dismissal from his former occupation as a police officer in the MPS (Metropolitan Police Service).

If Mr Roberts' DBS certificate had correctly recorded his conviction, he would not have been employed at Proof House where he had access to firearms.

It is unclear to me whether the inaccuracy of the DBS certificate was caused by an error made by the DBS or by the MPS.","On 30 August 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Michael Roberts aged 50 years.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

During the course of the Inquest evidence was heard from the lead road traffic collision investigator in the case that there are significant concerns in relation to the adequacy and layout of this particular junction and the five other junctions on this stretch of road (A690). Evidence was given that since this fatality, there has been another fatal road traffic collision on the 22/12/22, at the junction directly opposite. Further that between 11/01/00 and 31/12/22 there have been 21 collisions at this junction (including this fatality and 3 other serious collisions) and that there have been 29 collisions at the other junctions on this stretch of road (including one further fatality and 6 other serious collisions).

The concerns in relation to this junction, and the other junctions relate to:-
1. The volume of traffic that the junctions must manage.
2. The complexity of traffic movement at the junctions.
3. The speed limit in the vicinity of the junctions.

Concerns were also raised in relation to the planned extensive expansion/development of the area in the vicinity of the junction, including increased housing development, a proposed retail park, football site, as well as developments occurring more widely in the area which will lead to increased traffic, and that any proposed improvements to the junction are not required until prior to the occupation of the 39th dwelling on the site. The concern is that the proposals to improve the safety of the junction are not sufficient nor timely, and that consideration does not appear to have been given to reducing the speed limit within the junction series. A further concern was raised that the proposed improvements to the junction considered this junction in isolation, and did not consider the series of junctions on this
stretch of road.","On 12/07/2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Kelly Nicola DUNNE. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20/02/2023.

Chloe had been diagnosed with placenta previa during her antenatal care.  

Chloe had antepartum haemorrhage at home on the early morning of 19 June 2021 and had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. At the maternity unit she experienced further haemorrhage and was taken for emergency caesarean section. Her baby was delivered but Chloe quickly went into the first of three cardiac arrests. On the evidence it is not apparent that there was a postpartum haemorrhage, but she did develop blood clotting disorder and disseminated bleeding, likely related to the placental haemorrhage and amniotic fluid embolism. Chloe sadly died in the operating theatre despite prolonged resuscitation attempts. 
 
Chloe had recognised risk factors in her pregnancy and the consultant obstetrician with lead responsibility for her care decided at an appointment at week thirty-four of Chloe's pregnancy on a plan to review Chloe at an appointment at week thirty-seven, with a view to offering hospital admission and planned caesarean section by week thirty-eight due to the placenta previa. That plan was not recorded in Chloe's notes with the result that the obstetric registrar who saw Chloe at week thirty-seven was unaware of the plan. Furthermore, the relevant hospital Trust had not adopted national guidance issued in September 2018 for consideration of delivery by caesarean section between weeks thirty-six and thirty-seven in Chloe's circumstances. Consequently, Chloe was booked for planned caesarean section at week thirty- eight as per Trust guidance. At inquest the Trust accepted these were missed opportunities to avoid Chloe's death and had they not been missed it is likely that Chloe would not have died because delivery would have occurred well before 19 June, or, if antepartum haemorrhage had occurred during admission, it would have been successfully managed. 

Although not clearly causal or contributory to Chloe's death, I identified the following serious issues from the evidence: 

The maternity unit did not have a system or proforma to note down and pass on to clinicians information provided by the ambulance service via the dedicated phone line to the unit. 

Blood for urgent use in maternity unit surgery was not kept on or near to the maternity unit. There was delay in calling for the on-call consultant anaesthetist to attend once the emergency caesarean section had been called. 

There was no robust system in place for a major obstetric haemorrhage to be called and acted upon with resulting delay in the provision and use of blood products. 

There was insufficient co-ordination and oversight of the emergency team and roles and tasks in the surgical theatre, in particular in oversight of obtaining and use of blood products. 

Certain key equipment was not available for the maternity unit theatre: 
A blood storage fridge
Warming equipment for women during surgery
Point of care testing anticoagulation equipment","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
My principal concern is that having heard evidence from the Trust as to 'lessons learnt' and its current processes for identifying when Trust clinical policies and guidance needs updating, and where essential equipment needs to be obtained and located, I remain unclear that the Trust now has sufficiently robust processes in place to prevent similarly avoidable deaths to that of Chloe. Indeed, I am unclear that the processes are substantively different to those that existed at the time of Chloe's death.

It was of very particular concern to hear that clinicians at the time were aware of revised national pregnancy guidance issued in September 2018 but this had not been incorporated into Trust policy and guidance. I was told that introducing revised guidance was necessarily complex and lengthy and yet the Trust did incorporate the revised guidance just several weeks following Chloe's death and it appears because of her death. It was also very concerning to hear that the Trust had established a regional pregnancy service using out of date guidance. Certain changes relating to the circumstances of Chloe's death have only very recently been addressed or are in process; for example, the procedure to call and respond to a major maternal haemorrhage was to be tested a week or two after the inquest.

I therefore consider that the Trust should review its processes for identifying when Trust clinical policies and guidance needs updating, and where essential equipment needs to be obtained and located, in the interests of preventing future deaths, and that those processes should ensure timely revisions and associated actions.","On 9 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rachael Chloe WALKER aged 36. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 3 March 2023. Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights was engaged due to the relevance to Chloe's death of hospital Trust policies and systems. 

The conclusion of the inquest was: 
Chloe died of the effects of placental haemorrhage and amniotic fluid embolism at week thirty- seven of her pregnancy due to diagnosed placenta praevia. It is probable that her death would have been avoided if a delivery plan made for her had been recorded in her notes and acted upon, and if the relevant Trust had incorporated national guidance issued in September 2018 which provided for consideration for earlier caesarean delivery.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by May 11, 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)  
At the Inquest hearing, The Forest of Marston Vale Trust ('the Trust') stated that since Kryon's death they had taken no further action to address the risks of children drowning at Stewartby Lakes. However, it was clear from the evidence provided that: 

(1) The specific location where the incident occurred was well known to local children; the Head Ranger also admitted that this location, known as 'Location 5' along with 'Location 7' was known as an area where people would/could enter the water (albeit that there were signs at both locations indicating that swimming was prohibited). Furthermore, during the recent heatwave, (albeit this was not known to the Trust) local children had been regularly going to Location 5 and using a rope swing they knew to be located there [REDACTED].

(2) On Friday 29 July 2022, children had been present at the location using the rope swing since at least 2pm and yet their presence and/or the presence of the rope was not discovered[REDACTED] - whilst Rangers do check all areas of the park, including Stewartby Lake this is only incidental to their other duties on any given day and checks are not increased around the lake during hot weather (Head Ranger's evidence);

(3) At the location where the incident occurred, there are varying depths of water but (other than the general 'No Swimming' Safety Boards) there was no indication of these relative depths provided to visitors. Investigating police observed that there is a ledge of the lake that was waist height on the children (this was seen the video footage taken by the the children on the day of the incident) and that this shallow ledge drops away suddenly into deep water which is believed to be 13 metres deep. It was believed that Kyron had fallen beyond the edge of the shallow area.

(4) At the time of the incident, safety/life-saving equipment at the location of the incident was limited to a Safety Board consisting of a throwline in a locked box which required a code from Emergency Services (necessitating a 999 call) to release it. The Head Ranger explained that the previous life safety rings (costing approx. £40.00 each) had not been replaced once the locked throw lines had been installed. The locked throw line was not accessible to the children; although, they had seen the Safety Board as they had approached Location 5 and noted that there was some kind of float inside it, when they had gone to access it when Kyron went into the water they couldn't get the code as their phone battery had died. They reported that the box (Safety Board) ""felt very far away from where we were down at the water""[REDACTED]. Although since the Inquest, the Trust have indicated that in addition to the locked throw lines on the Safety Boards, traditional safety lines are also to be installed again at Locations 5 and 7; I am concerned that these are to be placed next to the Safety Boards rather than closer to the lakeside. Whilst prompt access to further life-saving equipment may not have altered the outcome in this incident, it might in future incidents.","On 05 August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kyron Marcus HIBBERT aged 13.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

There was little evidence before the court that the new carer had received any or any adequate training or shadowing experience. The new carer could not be deemed to be competent at mobilising a service user with a zimmer frame as there was no evidence that she had done so.

Lean on Me care agency was said to not currently be trading, but the company and web site remain live and therefore could recommence work in the care sector. The court requires confirmation of training schedules and policies, together with shadowing policies for new carers with no previous experience or training and confirmation that steps have been taken to avoid the situation that arose in this case, when a service user who should have been under direct supervision at all times when mobilising was unattended, and sustained a fatal head injury when she fell.","On 22 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Gunapathyammah Ranganathan .

On 11th July she was attended by a new, inexperienced carer who had insufficient training and shadowing to enable her to support Mrs Ranganathan safely during the morning care visit. While walking with her zimmer frame to the bathroom she was unattended and lost her balance, fell backwards and hit her head. She sustained a severe head injury that was unsurvivable and she died in St Mary's Hospital on 14 July 2021.

He had annual reviews of his placement at the school and was doing well and at the start of the winter 2020 term had managed to obtain a part time job and was considering career options of either the army or food industry. He had an extremely supportive family and parents who made significant efforts to ensure that he had access to the support he needed.

2.Both his parents and his school noted a decline in his mental health in December 2021 and he met with the school alongside his parents and his timetable was amended and steps to obtain additional support considered. On 14th January 2022 he told a member of staff at school that he had contacted the National Suicide Prevention helpline but later appeared to deny this. He apparently did not express any intent to harm himself but did express feelings of being low.

3. His parents, having tried to see what help was available locally, took steps to try to arrange private counselling and arranged for this to start after the February half term. The service the family approached did not consider Stefan was suitable for short term counselling and advice was given to approach his General Practitioner(GP). On 15th March 2022 Stefan's Mum spoke to his GP and asked for a letter to apply for funding from specific autism related counselling which his GP did but this was rejected and the letter received on 17th March 2022. At the
consultation which occurred on the telephone between Stefan's mother and his GP there was no mention of suicidal ideation or self-harm. On Sunday 20th March Stefan was found hanging at home in his bedroom by his family and he was taken to hospital and subsequently transferred to Kings College hospital where sadly he died on 26th March 2022.

4. In the course of hearing the evidence it was clear that local mental health services were considered to be accessible via a Single Point of Access and that anyone could refer in this way and the healthcare provider would then screen any referral which was made and possibly provide treatment. However such a referral was not made for Stefan because it was not clear that this was available to Stefan's family who would have taken whatever steps they could have done to ensure appropriate support. His General Practitioner was aware of the Single Point of Access and that there were groups available but waits for specific services for those with autism in her experience were at least 3 months and instead she referred him to a different service at South London and the Maudsley which she considered may better suit his needs. The referral was rejected but the correspondence on this only came to light after Stefan's sad death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.During the course of the inquest reference was made to the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance ""Autistic Spectrum disorder in under 19s: support and management."" Published on 28 August 2013 and in particular paragraph 1.1.4 which states that ""Local autism teams should ensure that every child or young person diagnosed with autism has a case manager or key worker to manage and coordinate treatment, care, support and transition to adult care in line with the NICE guideline on autism in children and young people (covering identification and diagnosis)."" Stefan did not have a case manager or key worker.

2. I am unable to say if the lack of a case manager or key worker caused or contributed more than minimally to Stefan's death but had one been available they may have been able to assist Stefan and his family to navigate the services available which in turn may have led to intervention which may have made a difference. I am prohibited from returning a conclusion which comments on issues where there is no clear causal link with the death however the Coroner's and
Justice Act 2009 creates a duty on Coroners to report an issue which gives rise to a concern which may lead to future deaths.

3. I asked for further evidence on the provision of case managers/key workers in accordance with the NICE guidance after the inquest from North East London Foundation Trust and from Kent and Medway Integrated Care Board. It is clear from the evidence provided that such a service is only provided to those under 19 year olds who have both a learning disability and/or a diagnosis of autism and are at risk of admission to a mental health hospital or where there is a significant sudden deterioration in the community and the multi disciplinary team has not been responsive. The lowest level of service outlined in reply to the court indicated that referrals could be made to a key worker to sign post families not that they would have a key worker allocated to them. This sets the bar at a level which means a large number of young people with a learning disability and/or autism would not have a key worker nor would they be expected to have one.

4.In the evidence provided it was outlined that ""Keyworkers will make sure that these children, young people and families get the right support at the right time.

(b) As a trans person, she was particularly vulnerable to stress.
(c) After she moved to London, Sophie came to experience episodes of psychosis and dissociation which became increasingly frequent and intensive, during which she lacked capacity freely to make decisions, and was liable not only to self-harm (as happened frequently) but also, in particular, to take an overdose of the drugs prescribed for her (as she did on 23 March 2021).
(d) She ""stockpiled"" her prescription drugs, but Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust (""the Trust"") gave her no warning not to do so, and did not take steps to alert her GP that she was doing so, which contributed to Sophie having access to enough drugs to amount to an overdose.
(e) The trauma and stress experienced by Sophie could cause or contribute to a dissociative episode, and were a strong risk factor for someone with a personality disorder (as Sophie was).
(t) The stress, and hence the risk of further psychotic and dissociative episodes - with the risk to her life that those entailed - was present and continuing, and was exacerbated by the following:

(1)Her concern that the Trust had not provided her with, or with certainty that she had, a long-term care plan.
(2)Her anxiety that the Trust had not provided her with a key-worker, and that she had very limited prospects of quickly and easily getting short-term, crisis help, if she were to need it.
(3)The Structured Clinical Management (SCM"") practitioner at the Trust made remarks to Sophie, as a trans woman, which were highly inappropriate. Sophie may have forgiven her for doing so, but the negative effect of those remarks remained.
(4) Although the Trust recognised ""The risks of withdrawing the antipsychotic completely would be that Sophie would experience a deterioration in her symptoms:….an increase in paranoia,"" it advised Sophie to stop her antipsychotic medication, which she had done by 12 May 2021.
(5)The Trust did not conduct its own diagnosis of Sophie's condition, or conditions. There was thus no check on whether Sophie did (in fact), have dissociative identity disorder, or dissociative amnesia (as was not suspected until after her death), and the treatment which the Trust did provide was determined accordingly.
(6)The Trust did not carry out any, or any adequate, assessment of the ever present risk of overdose death posed to Sophie by the consequences of the psychotic and dissociative episodes, and by the other stress factors in her life, and thus did not actively consider, and hence did not take, steps to address that risk.
(7)The SCM provided by the Trust was, objectively, appropriate, in relation to certain aspects of the EUPD, but it was not adequate to, and did not, address that present and continuing short-term risk, which was also a
recognised aspect of it. Sophie herself did not find it helpful.
(8)The mental health practitioner who conducted the SCM sessions did not fulfil the function of the key-worker to which Sophie had become accustomed in Belfast, and whose support she had found helpful.
The announcement (made twice) by the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust (""the GIC"") (that time which Sophie had spent waiting for treatment by the Brackenburg GIC in Belfast would not count towards her waiting-time. for the GIC) was ""devastating"" and left her ""raging"". Those effeqts were not negatived by the call which the GIC had promised to make to Sophie, and which she was expecting to receive.","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur, unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN, for trans persons on a Personality Disorder Pathway, arise out of the lack of provision of the following:
(A) by local NHS Trusts:
(1) The assignment of a single, named point of contact, available (aside from holiday and sickness absence) when needed by the patient
(2) The training of staff assigned to provide care and treatment to such persons, both at the time of their appointment, and annually thereafter, with a focus on:
(a) the needs of trans persons
(b) gender-affirming care
(c) dissociation and psychosis
(3) Scrutiny of the delivery and implementation of such training, by way of quality assurance.
(4) The absence from the assessment protocol of a provision to ensure that full account
is taken of:
(a) any previous diagnosis and treatment
(b) all other information (including information from those who have previously provided care and treatment to the patient) available to members of the team
(c) the risks to (and effects on) patients with (or likely to develop) conditions of dissociation and/or psychosis including, in particular, the risks of self-harm and loss of life
(d) the views of those who are close to the patient, including the patient's carers, family and advocates (both formal and informal), who should be contacted, for that purpose
(B) By clinics providing gender-identity treatment (and in relation to both current and prospective patients):
(1) a help-line, available when needed by patients
(2) the direction of patients to specialist carers
(3) provision of mental health care for those patients on waiting-lists
(4) liaison (at both local and national levels) among all clinicians concerned (or expected to be concerned) in the care and treatment of such patients
(5) the setting and implementation (where practicable) of criteria for deciding whether (and, if so, which) patients (other than those terminally ill) should be given priority for receiving treatment","On 24 May 2021, the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of SOPHIE GWEN WILLIAMS, aged 28. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest (heard before me) on 19 January 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was:  

Medical cause of death: 
1a Fatal toxic consumption of citalopram, propranolol, and quetiapine 
 
How, when and where and, for investigations where section 5(2) of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 applies, in what circumstances the deceased came by her death In the early hours of 20 May 2021, Sophie Gwen Williams died at her home, after taking a fatal overdose of prescription medications. She did so in the circumstances set out under 4 below.  

Conclusion of the Coroner as to the death Sophie Gwen Williams took the fatal overdose in consequence of being in a psychotic or dissociative state, in which she was not capable of forming (and did not form) any intention to take her own life.

He was arrested by police on suspicion of assaulting her and occasioning actual bodily harm. In interview on 5 August, he denied the charge. He was released from custody later that day on police bail subject to two conditions (i) not to contact Elaine or their two children and (ii) not to attend the property.  

On 6 August, it had been arranged for Mr Harman's son to collect personal items from Elaine at the home address. Mr Harman rang his son to delay the appointment. In breach of the bail conditions, he then attended the home address, forced entry and stabbed Elaine to death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -  
I attach for your ease of reference a copy of the College of Policing Approved Professional Practice entitled Post arrest management of suspect and case file and draw your attention to the following extract taken from page 17.

Checklist: Pre-release considerations
Before a suspect is released from a police station officers should: inform the victim of the suspect's impending release, regardless of whether the suspect has been
bailed or not, and record this notification check if the suspect is in possession of keys to the victim's house or car and remove them if so if the suspect offers a bail address with a previous or current partner, check not only that the person is happy for the suspect to be bailed there, but also that there is no history of domestic abuse - a curfew should never be imposed at an address where there is or has been domestic abuse update the risk assessment and safety plan

The guidance appears to anticipate a situation where a suspect and victim live at separate addresses but may have shared keys. The situation here was that Mr & Mrs Harman lived together at their home address in which they had shared ownership.

After police had interviewed Mr Harman for an offence of assaulting Elaine and causing her actual bodily harm - a charge Mr Harman denied - consideration was given to whether police could retain his house key given that a bail condition was imposed requiring him not to attend the address. It was felt that police did not have this power in law under s19 PACE or otherwise. Mr Harman's key was returned to him. It was found snapped off in the lock of the house door (along with a destroyed bolt) after Mr Harman forced entry.","On 24 February, I concluded an inquest into the death of Sharon Elaine Harman, 49, who was stabbed to death by her husband at their home address in Polperro, Cornwall on 6 August 2021. Mr Harman then cut his own throat. Tragically, both these events took place in front of the couple's teenage daughters.  

Elaine's medical cause of death was recorded as: 1a) Stab wounds to the neck and chest  

I recorded a Conclusion of Unlawful Killing.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you [AND/OR your organisation] have the power to take such action.

There appears an obvious disconnect in the guidance issued by the College of Policing and the laws provided to police under s19 PACE or otherwise. This appears of particular concern in cases of domestic violence where, previously, the parties have lived together.

The police officers who gave evidence at inquest were of one voice that an additional power to retain a house key - for the duration of imposed bail conditions only - would be an additional and helpful power to have.

It was recognised there may be difficulties in applying any such power from a practical perspective. Of note, there was no easy way, other than an Officer returning to a property, to check whether a key being retained was actually a house key. Further, it was foreseeable that there may be issues about what could be done where there were multiple copies of a house key perhaps held by a variety of different persons.

Nevertheless, it was felt appropriate to make this report to you so that you could reflect on the position generally.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 April 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Molly was treated for depression and had a history of chronic self-harm that had required a prolonged hospital admission at St Aubyn's under the Mental Health Act and did not accept her diagnosis with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. Molly was discharged on 17 August 2020 following phased community leave with a plan in place for her mental health. Confusion between different statutory provisions led to her case being closed to social care and, significant delays in this case being reopened. Molly was allocated a social worker five weeks after her discharge for an assessment that was ongoing. Molly attended her Care Programme Approach meeting on 9th October 2020 and left distressed.

Suicide - Social care failed to carry out appropriate requested assessments during Molly's prolonged hospital admission and there was not a coherent co- ordinated approach to meeting Molly's social aftercare needs. Molly's right to aftercare services was recorded but the functions were not discharged as they should have been during her admission, and this contributed to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) Molly had a delayed diagnosis of Autism. Molly was diagnosed during her detention at the St. Aubyn Centre when she experienced a mental health crisis and detained under the Mental Health Act.

(2) There was insufficient assessment for discharge planning purposes of the impact of Molly's recent diagnosis of Autism by Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust

(3) There was insufficient consideration given to the impact of Molly's delayed diagnosis of Autism on her chronic high risk of suicide in her discharge and discharge planning in a background of Molly not accepting her diagnosis.

(4) Lack of escalation to Essex County Council when there was a failure to respond to requests for assessment and attendance at discharge planning meetings and the key worker/care co-ordinator carrying too heavy a workload as a consequence.

(5) Essex County Council did not:
a. act on appropriate referrals to social care by Essex Partnership NHS Trust
b. conduct required assessments of Molly during her detention
did not appoint a social worker until after Molly was discharged
There was a lack of understanding of the impact of Molly's detention on her right to assessment as a child in need and how this changed during her detention under the Mental Health Act.

(6) A lack of understanding of section 117 Mental Health Act rights and potential for consideration for entitlements to meet Molly's needs related to her mental health disorder, by Essex County Council:
a. compelling Molly to choose between family members as part of her discharge planning and then as a consequence changing Molly's status during her detention from homeless.
b. Lack of assessment for any s117 needs to facilitate discharge
Lack of appreciation of the impact of Molly's autism diagnosis in a background of chronic suicide risk on decision-making and Molly's potential to understand the decisions being made.","On 27 October 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of Molly Ann SERGEANT, aged 17 years.

When found, Anthony was inside the property, suspended by a rope around his neck.  

Anthony lived in London, and his mental health had been deteriorating over a period of time. 
 
On 29th March 2022, at approximately 13:30 Anthony left London and headed towards his second home in Suffolk.  
Anthony was known to be in possession of rope and a 'collapsible' bicycle when he left.  

The information regarding the rope and the bicycle was not passed to Suffolk police at the time the case was reported to them.  

At 17:50 a Suffolk officer attended Anthony's second home but did not enter although keys were available from a neighbour. Anthony's vehicle was not present, and the officer formed the opinion that he had insufficient information to enter the premises under Section 17, Police and Criminal Evidence Act at that time.

Shortly after this time, Anthony's vehicle was found in a car park more than two miles from his second home, and police search activity was focussed there.

At approximately 20:00, once Suffolk officers became aware that Anthony had a rope, and the search of the car park area had failed to locate him, they returned to the second home and entered, finding Anthony deceased. The collapsible bicycle was found in the hallway.

Poor communication between the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary meant that the officers on the ground were missing information which would have informed their decision making regarding the search for Anthony and informed their use of police powers.

This resulted in a missed opportunity to find Anthony earlier than he was found.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Evidence was heard from police officers from both the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary.

The officers provided evidence of the details they respectively held regarding the missing person investigation surrounding Anthony's disappearance from London and subsequent death.

It was clear that crucial information (that Anthony had a rope in his possession, and a collapsible bicycle providing a secondary form of transport) was not passed between the Metropolitan Police and Suffolk Constabulary.

It was heard that there was no set format, or prescribed information requirements to be shared by officers reporting missing persons between one force and another. Investigating officers in the Metropolitan police spoke to the Suffolk Constabulary control room, whose staff logged what they were told onto the CAD record. This information was then relayed to the officers on the ground.

Witnesses in this case stated that there is no standardised information sharing requirement or protocol for cross border missing persons investigations (including missing persons with suicidal ideation).

I am concerned that, as there is no standardised information sharing requirements or protocols in such cases, in the future a force receiving details of a suicidal missing person may also not be informed that an individual has taken a means of suicide with them. In addition, other important information that may assist in the search for that person may also not be passed.","On 7th April 2022 I commenced an investigation into the tragic death of Anthony John Raymond INGRAM.

2. The alert system is only triggered after a patient attends a smear test. For a non-responder, they go back into the three or five year waiting list for a National Screening invitation for a smear test.

3. An automatic flag or alert when a patient fails to attend for a smear test as part of the National Screening Service, would mean that a GP surgery would not have to manually add a warning as an entry onto an individual's GP records.

(a)Staff at Latimer Court who were looking after Mrs. Gormley may not have been aware that she presented an increased risk of suffering a fall; and
(b)Measures to mitigate that increased risk were not considered. Such measures could have included:

(i)Asking a GP to refer Mrs. Gormley to the falls clinic;
(ii)Placing a sensor mat by her bed or chair, to alert staff to when she was mobilising;
(iii)Referring her to Occupational Therapy for mobility aids such as a walking stick or frame;
(iv)Briefing staff at Latimer Court to intervene whenever Mrs. Gormley was seen mobilising by herself, and to offer her assistance.

A CT scan of the deceased was undertaken at Ysbyty Gwynedd late on the evening of 30th March 2021. The deceased was then transferred to the Royal Stoke University Hospital, Stoke-on-Trent by air ambulance before the radiologist's report on the CT scan was available.

It was not clear that safe receipt of the report in Stoke-on-Trent was ever confirmed. Doctors in Stoke-on-Trent then failed to follow up on signs of a possible bowel injury which were indicated in the radiologist's report on the CT scan.

In his later years he developed cognitive impairment, which in turn led to him being at very high risk of falls. This risk, in relation to which he needed constant supervision, was known to those caring for him and to those responsible for looking after him when he was admitted to the Emergency Department of the West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was admitted to the hospital Emergency Department not because he himself was experiencing a medical emergency, but as a last resort after exhaustive efforts to explore all options before Will was admitted to hospital: it proved not to be possible to find suitable alternative care for him in residential care placements while his wife, and main carer, underwent unplanned emergency major surgery.

The inquest heard evidence that, prior to his admission to hospital, at least eight social care providers were contacted plus further residential homes, but none of them could provide emergency care for Will. The inquest heard undisputed evidence that this was an instance of a national care shortage.

The inquest heard evidence that in an Emergency Department where many patients are suffering medical emergencies constant one-to-one supervision will not always be possible. I found as a fact that it was not possible on this occasion and that Will's fall in the Emergency Department took place when the nursing assistant who was trying to maintain constant one-to-one supervision of Will insofar as possible had their attention momentarily diverted to another patient experiencing a medical emergency. I judged that it would not be just to describe this as a failure on the part of the nursing assistant or the Emergency Department staff.

The reason why it was not an individual failure included that the inquest heard evidence that the hospital, and in particular the Emergency Department, was experiencing significant pressures associated with high demand and an internal critical incident had been declared. There was a high demand for beds within the hospital without the availability of beds to meet the demand. This included the facts that there were, at the time of Will's arrival in the Emergency Department, 50 patients in the Emergency Department, of whom 32 were waiting for bed placement. Moreover, staffing was at a 'black status' (the worst level) across the hospital, with a deficiency of staff of around 60 nurses and nursing assistants.

I found as a fact that those severe pressures - the high demand levels and the deficiency of staff and scarcity of resource - contributed to the death. Firstly, if it had been possible to care for and supervise Will on a constant basis as he needed, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.

Secondly, on the balance of probabilities, the scarcity of resource relative to demand contributed to Will not being transferred to a ward - or other more appropriate environment - sooner.

Apart from the inherent particular difficulties in providing constant supervision in an Emergency Department referred to above, the inquest also received undisputed evidence that the environment of a busy, noisy Emergency Department, with lights on at all hours of the day and night would be overly stimulating and not the most suitable environment for someone with cognitive impairment who was experiencing confusion and agitation. I found that such an environment probably contributed to Will's inclination to wander and so to his fall.

If it had been possible to transfer Will to a more suitable environment sooner, then on the balance of probabilities the fall that led directly to his passing would have been prevented and his life would have been prolonged.

I found as a fact that, on the balance of probabilities, the lack of availability of more appropriate care contributed to the death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

1) A national care shortage contributed to a situation where a gentleman who was not experiencing a medical emergency, but who required constant supervision for his own safety in view of his cognitive impairment and very high falls risk, could not be cared for anywhere other than in a hospital Emergency Department. If there is not sufficient provision of care, including residential care placements, such that those in similar need do not receive suitable care, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths will occur or continue to exist in the future, when they are placed in an environment that is not realistically able to provide the constant supervision needed, as occurred in this case.

The severe pressures on the hospital, including the Emergency Department, were such that they were experiencing scarcity of resource relative to demand and a severe deficiency of staff. In these circumstances, it was both not possible to provide the care and supervision that Will needed in the Emergency Department, and the scarcity of resource contributed to Will not being transferred sooner to a ward or other more appropriate environment, where Will could receive the constant supervision that would probably have prevented the fall that led to his death. The evidence was that the scarcity of resource experienced was a challenge on the national level, rather than just a particular local issue. If hospitals, including Emergency Departments, do not receive sufficient resource, then circumstances creating a risk of future deaths, due to an inability to provide the required care and / or prompt transfer to an available ward bed or appropriate alternative place, will occur or continue to exist in the future.","On 18th March 2022 an investigation was commenced into the death of Joseph Willy Maunick.  The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18th April 2023. The narrative conclusion of the inquest was that:  

Joseph Willy Maunick (Will) died on 15th March 2022 as a result of a severe head injury that he suffered in a fall in the Emergency Department of West Suffolk Hospital on 4th March 2022. He was in the Emergency Department as a social admission, while his wife was going through unplanned emergency major surgery.  Will was not safe to be left alone at home and required care around the clock. Exhaustive efforts to find appropriate care while his wife was in hospital were unsuccessful, so he had been admitted to a hospital Emergency Department as a last resort. This was not the most suitable environment for a gentleman with dementia who was a falls risk and required constant supervision. The situation was exacerbated by pre-existing severe pressures on the Emergency Department on that day due to high demand for beds, without the availability of beds to meet the demand, and a severe deficiency of staff. The scarcity of resource, relative to demand, at the hospital also contributed to Will not being transferred to a ward sooner. While there was no specific failure by an individual that contributed to the death, Will's death was contributed to by the lack of availability of more appropriate care.  

The medical cause of death was confirmed as:  
1(a) Subdural Haematoma
1(b) Fall

In 2020 (the last figures publicly available) there were 174 fatal accidents cause by drivers over the age of 70 years old.

Following several documented suicide attempts the latest on 7 July 2019 Sharon Elizabeth Langley took the actions to immerse herself in the water in the bath and did so with the intention to end her life. Therefore, we return a conclusion of Suicide with the following additional narrative. Sharon was taken for a supervised bath and access was granted by staff to the bathroom at 09:33:57. The evidence shows staff who should have been assisting Sharon were in other places on the ward at the time of her bath, suggesting she was left alone and unsupervised. Although not formally documented evidence was heard Sharon should be assisted whilst having a bath. 

Sharon was found face down and unclothes in a bath with water at around 10am by the healthcare assistants who pulled her out of the bath and laid her on the floor next to the bath. Initial staff response was inadequate and insufficient causing a delay in triggering the pinpoint alarm and ambulance being called. However, when nurses arrived emergency treatment was adequate with evidence showing the AED was used correctly.

Paramedics arrived on the scene within 3 minutes to take over emergency aid. The paramedics lacked information about the incident from staff and Sharon was taken to the Accident and Emergency department at 10:39 where she was declared dead.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust staff immediate emergency response was not followed:
a. pinpoint alarms were not activated immediately on finding Sharon Langley unresponsive

b. there was a delay calling the ambulance and basic key information about the type of the emergency was not relayed:

i. by qualified nurses who made the 999 calls, or
ii. to paramedics on attendance

c. there was a delay informing the site co-ordinator of the emergency even though she was based on the ward and there was a lack of co- ordination of the emergency resulting in the ambulance being called a second time by the site co-ordinator

d. staff trained in basic life support did not assist the two nurses who were attempting to resuscitate Sharon Langley

There was a difference in the safety measures fitted to the bathroom door on the adjoining Stort Ward that had a self-closure mechanism at the time of Sharon's death. This mechanism has now been fitted to Chelmer Ward. There is a concern that safety information is not shared across the Trust and known risks are not mitigated appropriately.
(3) The Trust was on notice of issues on Chelmer ward with doors to high- risk areas not closing that included the Staff Room and Patient Storeroom.

a. At the time of Sharon's death, the mitigation on the ward was for staff to push doors to see if they were locked, this was action even though evidence was heard that these doors had keylocks and staff had keys that could have been used.
b. The Patient Storeroom contains items removed from patients as they pose a significant self-harm risk and/or suicide.
c. Staff Room that contains items that pose a risk to patients

Self-closure mechanisms have not been fitted to these doors in a high- risk environment of a secure psychiatric ward even though the risk is known. Evidence was heard from patient safety that it is sufficient to have maintenance manually adjust doors if there are closure issues.

(4) Chelmer Ward staff did not always report door closure issues either on the ward to the Nurse in Charge or to maintenance. Following the death of Sharon Langley there has been no training on how to report door closure issues reported.

(5) Evidence was heard that the bath plug was required to be kept in the ward office when not in use as the bathroom was a high-risk area. There was no evidence that staff had to obtain this from the office on the day Sharon Langley died. There still appears to be confusion around the requirement.

(6) There is concern about the reliability of the Trust investigation and how the Trust learns lessons. The investigation report did not:

a. scrutinise the movements of staff even though the door logs were available or raise any issues for further investigation
b. raise any issues around the bath plug or where it should be kept
c. investigate concerns raised around the Trust staff emergency response or failure to provide basic information on the incident to paramedics

(7) The Trust investigation author changed the conclusion of his report during the inquest when he received statements provided by staff that were not requested and contained timing information that in evidence staff stated they did not know.

(8)Quality of record keeping was not deemed to be appropriate by senior staff during evidence:

On 6/5/22 Stephen was in the company of several friends in the Club whilst he was overseeing in a voluntary capacity the entertainment that had been previously booked to appear.  

During the afternoon he had been drinking alcohol, although he was not thought to be unduly intoxicated when he left the club for a taxi to take him home. It was as Stephen made his way down the stairs, with the assistance of a walking stick, that he took a fall on the lower steps, causing his head to make direct contact with the glazing in the double doors at the bottom of the stair case, such that his head became lodged between the broken glass.  

Although paramedics arrived very quickly, Stephen was found to have passed away.  

In considering the evidence, I noted the contents of an experts' report who had conducted a site visit at the club, in which he expressed the view that the glazing that Stephen made contact with was not safety glass and as such was a major contributor to his demise.  

He also confirmed that the double doors were too near the bottom step and do not comply with legislation governing the spatial requirements. During the inquest representatives of the Club informed me that they were to immediately take remedial steps to prevent a further recurrence and that they would write to me in due course to confirm that they have been implemented.","It became clear during the inquest that the double doors and glazing had been installed in the early 1990's and not in accordance with current H&S requirements.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

-To review and consider the adequacy of such glazing in doors positioned at the bottom of the stairs, throughout other Conservative Clubs in England and Wales to enable compliance with existing H&S and Fire regulations.
- To review and consider the adequacy of the proximity of the doors positioned near to the bottom of the stairs throughout other conservative Clubs in England and Wales in order to ensure compliance with existing H&S and Fire regulations.","On 22/3/22 I opened an inquest into the death of Stephen Geoffrey Preston who, at the date of his death was aged 68 years old.

They became involved in a parking dispute with their neighbour, [REDACTED]. It would appear that [REDACTED] took umbrage at Jennifer, in particular, parking her vehicle in a particular location and manner within the development. She was perfectly legally entitled to park how and where she did; simply didn't like it and took petty action of moving his bins to block spaces and/or parking his own vehicle in an inconsiderate manner to cause a nuisance. 

There were some instances of police involvement, but this was largely either deemed to be a civil matter or verbal harassment [REDACTED] by who embarked on a course of conduct designed to intimidate or frighten Mr, but more particularly Mrs Chapple. 

On the 21 st November 2021 at 09:45am [REDACTED] telephoned Avon and Somerset Constabulary and informed the call-taker that he had stabbed his neighbours, Mr and Mrs Chapple. They suffered significant wounds and were sadly pronounced deceased at the scene. 

The IOPC Report concluded that the Police acted appropriately to the incidents reported at the time and there was no indication from the previous conduct that physical violence and/or a double homicide offence was even a remotely foreseeable possibility. 

[REDACTED] was charged with the double murder and after a trial was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court on the 21 st June 2022 to a fixed minimum custodial term of 38 years.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern . In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The murder weapon was a ceremonial dagger that had been presented to[REDACTED], following his retirement from the British Army. [REDACTED] was in the British Army was 2002 2017 (Royal Engineers) and, on leaving, he was presented with the ceremonial dagger as a commemorative token of his service. 

The dagger was not a blunt replica, it was a fully functional weapon capable of causing significant harm, injury and sadly in the Chapple's case, death.

Please reconsider the appropriateness of providing anyone leaving the British Army, regardless of rank or status, with what is (to all intents and purposes) a deadly weapon. Such presentation/gifting has essentially put a deadly weapon in the community (where I understand it sadly remains, having never been recovered as it was removed from the scene prior to police attendance) and I am not persuaded that this is appropriate. 

During the trial, evidence was adduced by [REDACTED] defence team to allude to the poor mental health of [REDACTED] because of combat and tours of war-torn countries. This is not an uncommon feature of those serving in and/or leaving the Army and adds further weight to my concerns around the appropriateness of such items (whether ceremonial or not) being issued in the first place, but secondly being issued to those who may have a propensity for mental health issues.",,In my opinion urgent action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 25th April 2023 , the coroner, may extend the period.

He was 18 years of age. Several weeks later, another resident, referred to as ""the assailant"" also 18 years old was placed in the same accommodation as an emergency. 11 days after they were placed together, the assailant fatally stabbed Lance Scott Walker.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

1 Response requested from Secretary of State for Education and Secretary of State for Health and Social Care
Lance was only exposed to his killer because he was obliged to live in the designated accommodation. Although the 2 relevant Councils were duty bound to house both individuals up until the age of 21 under the Leaving Care Act, there is currently no regulation for the over 18's. Regulation is being introduced for 16- 17 year olds in April 2023.

Both Councils were in agreement that Regulation of this sector would be welcomed to support them in carrying out their statutory obligations . A set of minimum requirements to introduce clear guidance across the sector would benefit the residents, the providers and all stakeholders in this particularly challenging sector. Currently OFSTED does not have an obligation to be involved and this falls outside the CQC's regulation as the provision is not for ""care"" but support. The provision is made from an entirely un-regulated sector, resulting in some organisations offering accommodation with inadequate training, staffing or knowledge to meet the complex needs of some of our most vulnerable individuals. Consideration should be given to introducing regulation for at least 18-21 year old individuals. This issue remains a concern for all those who work within it.

2 Response requested from London Borough of Ealing, London Borough o,
Islington and the West London Alliance
There is currently no standard referral form for service users aged 16-25 to be referred into supported housing. This means that best practise is not universally followed and it is more difficult for the stakeholders to have to deal with a number of different forms. Vital information can potentially be missed and issues not highlighted when a variety of forms are used for the same referral procedure.
Consideration should be given to adopting a standard form across the West London Alliance, or even a national standard using ""best practise"" as the benchmark, for clarity and ease of reference.

3 Response from London Borough of Ealing
The Court was advised that the inquest had raised several points that will be further considered but that have not yet been addressed following this tragic death. In particular, system review of the ""due diligence"" in matching of
individuals in the accommodation needs to be carried out and further lessons can be learnt in relation to the Borough's obligations in this regard. Strengthening the contractual elements between the Borough and Providers would ensure additional oversight of these relationships. Additional work in double checking and auditing placement forms needs further review to learn from the issues encountered in this case, and to improve the consistency and standard of referrals, with consideration on the introduction of mandatory fields for specific information to be included. The Borough undertook to enhance ""New provider"" scrutiny and approval in the light of the inquest findings. Confirmation of these positive steps and actions should be provided to allay the jury and Court's concerns arising from this inquiry.","On 17 July 2017 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lance Scott Walker, age 18 . The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 21 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was  

Medical cause of death  
1a Shock and Haemorrhage 
1b Stab Wounds to the back  

Lance Scott Walker was killed by The Assailant in the afternoon of 15 August 2016 in Gledwood Drive, Hayes. The immediate cause of death was shock and haemorrhage, due to stab wounds to the back. Numerous circumstances both probably and possibly led to this death.  

The jury Conclusion was as follows - (the questionnaire they responded to is attached for ease of reference):-  

The jury is satisfied by unanimous decision that, on the balance of probability, Lance Scott Walker was unlawfully killed.  

1. In response to the questionnaire: regarding the West London NHS Trust, the jury finds by unanimous decision errors, omissions, and failures that probably caused Lance Scott Walker's death, considering: 
• Insufficient planning for the transfer of The Assailant's care from child and adolescent services to adult services;Inadequate management of The Assailant's care following the transfer of his care from CAMHS to the Early 
• Intervention in Psychosis team when he turned 18, including the administration of his depot medication and the absence of any contact with The Assailant, including by way of home visit. 
• The grave lack of any assessment in order to determine whether the assailant should be detained under the Mental Health Act of 1983.
• Unacceptable assessment, if any, of the risks The Assailant posed to others, including by way of violent offending, on and after 29 June 2016
• The insufficient communication on the part of the Trust with Urban Youth Flex and the London Borough of Ealing, including informing them of The Assailant's mental health, needs and risks and liaising with Urban Youth Flex and the London Borough of Ealing regarding the Assailant's mental health, needs, or Risks.

2. In response to the questionnaire: regarding the London Borough of Islington, the jury finds by unanimous decision errors, omissions, and failures probably caused or contributed to Lance Scott Walker's death, considering:
• The unsatisfactory decision to commission Urban Youth Flex to provide unregulated accommodation to 23 Gledwood Gardens to Lance Scott Walker specifically regarding matters of financial due diligence and the absence of a contract, in particular detailing the expectations on the care provider
- Urban Youth flex;
• Insufficient evidence to show suitable management of Lance Scott Walker during his placement in 23 Gledwood Gardens

3. In response to the questionnaire: regarding the London Borough of Ealing, the jury finds by unanimous decision errors, omissions, and failures that probably caused or contributed to Lance Scott Walker's death, considering:
• The inappropriate commissioning of Urban Youth Flex to provide unregulated accommodation at 23 Gledwood Gardens to The Assailant specifically regarding matters of financial due diligence and the absence of a contract, in particular detailing the expectations on the care provider- Urban Youth flex;
• The inappropriate placement of The Assailant in unregulated accommodation at 23 Gledwood Gardens managed by Urban Youth Flex;
• The grave omission of information regarding The Assailant by London Borough
of Ealing with Urban Youth Flex when they placed The Assailant on 4 August 2016, including his forensic history, risk of offending, harming others and being bullied and details of his medication and medical regime;
• The grave lack of communication by London Borough of Ealing with the Trust and/or Urban Youth Flex after The Assailant's placement on 4 August 2016;
• The inadequate system in place whereby Merlins are shared with the allocated social worker;
• The unacceptable lack of escalation of The Assailant's specific case through the appropriate channels;
• The failing in proper internal communication between the various interested departments of the London Borough of Ealing with respect to The Assailant's case.

4. In response to the questionnaire: regarding Urban Youth Flex (also known as Choices Homes), the jury finds by majority decision (8-2) errors, omissions, and failures that possibly caused or contributed to Lance Scott Walker's death, considering:
• The improper training, experience, staffing levels, and formal qualifications of the Urban Youth Flex staff working at 23 Gledwood Gardens;
• Urban Youth Flex's inadequate ongoing management of their tenant's suitability with one another, after (and only after) they were placed in 23 Gledwood Gardens;
The failure to share information with the London Borough of Islington and London Borough of Ealing, including in particular the incidents on the 11th and 12th August 2016.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report , namely by 13 March 2023.

She went to a hospital in Bali where she deteriorated and died on the 24th July 2022 despite treatment. Post-mortem examination included toxicology. It was found that she had methanol in her system which had caused her death. Methanol is not meant for human consumption. She had inadvertently consumed methanol believing she had consumed alcohol.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
The Inquest heard evidence that there is a growing problem of methanol being passed off as alcohol for human consumption particularly in places such as Bali. Methanol is used rather than ethanol in spirits aimed at the Western market and sold even through apparently reputable suppliers.

The evidence before the Inquest was that :
1.Knowledge of the problem amongst the expatriate/tourist community was very low despite the increase in the problem and the catastrophic consequences of methanol consumption;

2.There was little publicity by the UK Government of the risk in contrast to the approach taken by the Australian Government who had undertaken a campaign to increase awareness to protect their citizens travelling in areas of Asia such as Bali;

3.  The UK Government publicising information about the risk of methanol being used in local spirits, steps that could be taken by UK nationals travelling to reduce the risk and warning signs of methanol toxicity would help to reduce the chance of others dying in the way in which Kirsty McKie died","On 9th August 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Kirsty Margaret McKie.

Mental health patient absconder and missing person from St Marys Hospital.

Deceased has absconded from the ward and met with a friend (previous patient on the same ward) at New Malden railway station. Friend has agreed to let the deceased stay at his flat in Kingston. Deceased has bought heroin and smoked it, deceased underwent laboured breathing and lost consciousness. Friend of the deceased called LAS who arrived and carried out CPR to no avail.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
Chris was known to abscond from secure mental health detention during periods of ""escorted leave"". He had left the care of the Trust on 6 occasions during his final 3 month detention and was known to purchase and take illicit drugs on these occasions. His Consultant had discussed this high risk behaviour with him on many occasions.

(1) The Consultant Psychiatrist had signed the agreed escorted leave form on the basis that Chris would be accompanied 1:1 with a nurse. The purpose of the leave was therapeutic, to enable Chris to access the community in a supported manner. Evidence was before the court that the leave was only to the adjacent car park, to facilitate a smoking break, and 1 member of staff accompanied up to 6 patients. The Trust's own Root Cause Analysis report confirms that the practise was at this time for 1 staff member to accompany those patients who wished to smoke to the adjacent carpark.

(2) The car park is entirely unsecure and open to the road. Evidence given in court was that the hospital site is non-smoking, but the evidence was unclear whether the car park was considered to be part of the hospital site or separate.

(3)My concern is that there has been a tolerated blurring of the boundaries between the intentions of escorted leave for individuals under a MHA section, and the ward staff's ability to facilitate this in a meaningful and therapeutic way to benefit the patients, and that the clinical staff were not aware of this. Chris had indicated his desire to access the cash point and buy Christmas presents for his family, but there was no suggestion these requests had been considered by the Trust and either approved or refused. Chris therefore made the decision to leave the ward, with catastrophic consequences. Has the Trust given any consideration to the provision of a ""safe"" smoking area that patients can access without the need to be accompanied or to use their restricted escorted leave for this purpose alone?","On 31 December 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Christopher Thomas Ace RYAN. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest . 

The conclusion of the inquest was Mr Christopher Thomas Ace Ryan was detained under section 3 of the mental health act in laurel ward of Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton.

In the days leading up to Mr Ryan's death hospital notes documented he was well, compliant in taking prescribed medication and following hospital regulations on escorted leave, returning on two prior occasions on the 21st and 22nd December 2020.

No apparent concerns in needing to change his risk assessment for future escorted leave. On 23rd December 2020 Mr Ryan absconded from escorted leave and was reported missing to the police at 13.51 by the hospital staff. He was assessed as medium risk by the police.

Jess died on 14 May 2021 at the Chesterfield Royal Hospital shortly after giving birth to her daughter. Jess had a high risk pregnancy. This was primarily due to Jess' severe hypertension. Jess also had a rare condition known as Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome (""KTS"") which created an increased risk of Jess developing a deep vein thrombosis/pulmonary embolism. The main challenge during Jess' pregnancy was her hypertension. The inquest found, however, that Jess' hypertension was managed appropriately by her consultant in Chesterfield with input from a specialist renal physician.  

As to KTS, the inquest found that there was no documented evidence of clinicians in Chesterfield having properly considered the impact that KTS may have on Jess' pregnancy. The inquest found that this did not, however, contribute to Jess' death.  

On 21 April 2021 a consultant in Chesterfield prescribed a prophylactic dose of tinzaparin due to an increased risk of clotting. The consultant gave evidence at the inquest that the intention was for Jess to continue to receive a daily dose of anticoagulant medication up until birth. Jess was then transferred to a hospital in Sheffield on 22 April 2021. There was a failure to communicate to the hospital in Sheffield the plan for ongoing prophylactic anticoagulant medication to continue until birth. This meant that the team in Sheffield were unaware of the plan for prophylactic anticoagulant medication to continue until birth. Jess was discharged from the hospital in Sheffield on 26 April 2021 back into the care of the team in Chesterfield without any anticoagulant medication.  

During the subsequent weeks following the discharge from Sheffield, clinicians in Chesterfield failed to identify that Jess was no longer receiving the anticoagulant medication that Jess' consultant in Chesterfield had intended would be taken until birth. A clinician gave evidence at the inquest that she would have restarted the tinzaparin had she been aware that Jess was no longer receiving it upon her discharge from Sheffield. The inquest found that if Jess had received the daily anticoagulant medication as the clinician in Chesterfield had intended, it is more likely than not that the pulmonary embolism would not have occurred. Therefore, the failure to ensure that Jess received the intended anticoagulant medication up until birth made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to her death on 14 May 2021.

On 13 May 2021 Jess attended the Chesterfield Royal Hospital and a decision was made to carry out an emergency caesarean section. The procedure was successful and Jess' baby was born. Shortly after delivery, Jess went into cardiac arrest. Despite the very best efforts of the attending clinicians, Jess died on 14 May 2021. A post mortem examination took place. The cause of death was a pulmonary embolism that arose due to a deep vein thrombosis (the risk of this was increased by the KTS). Jess also died as a result of an acute anaphylaxis. It was not possible to identify the cause of the anaphylaxis but the inquest heard evidence that it could have been caused by an antibiotic despite Jess having no known allergies.

The inquest found that the efforts of those involved in the resuscitation were exemplary.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) I heard evidence from Jess' consultant that she intended that tinzaparin would be taken by Jess up until birth. When Jess was discharged from Sheffield back into the care of Chesterfield, nobody in Chesterfield identified that Jess was not receiving the tinzaparin which the consultant told the inquest ought to have been in place until birth.

(2) I heard evidence that there was no communication to the team in Sheffield that Jess' consultant in Chesterfield intended that she should continue to receive tinzaparin until birth. Therefore, when Jess was discharged from Sheffield on 26 April 2021, she was not given tinzaparin because the team in Sheffield were unaware of this plan. I am concerned, therefore, about the quality and adequacy of the information handed over to Sheffield at the point of Jess being transferred into their care.

(3) I heard evidence that following Jess' discharge from Sheffield on 26 April 2021, Chesterfield did not receive any communications from Sheffield about Jess' care during her time in Sheffield. I am concerned that there was no process in place in Chesterfield to follow up and find out what had happened during Jess' short period under the care of Sheffield. Had efforts been made to liaise with the team in Sheffield, the tinzaparin issue might have been identified.

(4) I heard in evidence that some staff were unaware of KTS and its potential implications for pregnancy. This was understandable. However, I did not see evidence of any consultant having properly considered and then documented in Jess' notes the potential impact that KTS might have had on Jess' pregnancy.","On 5 October 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jessica Hodgkinson (""Jess""). The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 27 January 2023. The narrative conclusion of the inquest was: 'Jess died on 14 May 2021 due to a pulmonary embolism that arose from a deep vein thrombosis (the risk of this was increased by the KTS) as well as acute anaphylaxis of unknown cause. There was a failure to ensure that Jess received anticoagulant medication that a clinician had intended should be taken until birth. This failure made a more than minimal, negligible or trivial contribution to Jess' death on 14 May 2021.'",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 21 July 2023.

She was then taken to Wythenshawe Hospital. There was a delay in triage due to demands on the Emergency Department. Triage did not pick up on her being a potential silver trauma case. A CT scan was not ordered at that time. She was triaged to be seen within 1 hour. 

Due to demands on the Emergency Department she was not seen by a clinician until approximately 6 hours after triage. This was not a senior clinician assessment due to staffing levels and demands on the department. The junior doctor found no significant injuries but asked for a more senior review. This was delayed due to the workload demands on the middle grade doctor. On assessment the middle grade doctor identified a CT scan was required. The CT scan was requested at 04.21. The scan was reviewed by a clinician at 7am before the radiology report itself was available. The actual report was delayed due to workload demands on the radiology registrar. 

It was identified that she had severe injuries from the road traffic collision and a transfer to a major trauma centre was required. Celia Sanderson began to deteriorate whilst further tests were undertaken and awaiting transfer. The further tests identified she had also sustained significant neurological damage from the road traffic collision.

She continued to deteriorate and had an acute myocardial infarction. She died at Wythenshawe Hospital before she could be transferred.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
1. Demands on the Emergency Department due to the volume of people waiting to be seen meant that Mrs Sanderson had a long wait for a clinician review far outside the expected target time. The inquest heard evidence that delays such as hers were common throughout that period and were due to the volume of people attending and staff available to deal with them;

2. The inquest heard that amongst the challenges faced was a shortage of ED consultants and ED middle grade doctors. Mrs Sanderson's time at the hospital included late evening and the early hours of the morning. The inquest heard that across the NHS during these hours the number of staff at these grades in an ED is significantly reduced. Historically that had been a quieter period however demands on ED meant that was no longer the case. As a consequence senior reviews of patients were further delayed. An earlier review by a senior clinician was the inquest heard likely to have identified her as a potential silver trauma case and ensured she was moved to a trauma centre for appropriate treatment before she began to deteriorate;

3. Evidence given to the inquest indicated that the ability to carry out and report promptly on CT scans was essential if trauma cases were to be identified with sufficient speed to ensure a timely transfer to a trauma unit. The inquest heard that timely transfer to a trauma unit was likely to significantly improve the outcome for a trauma patient. The inquest was told that once CT scans were requested there were often delays due to a shortage of suitably qualified staff to carry them out and then to report on them. As an example of this the inquest was told that overnight 1 radiology registrar was responsible for reporting on CT scans for 3 hospitals (Wythenshawe, the MRI and RMCH) In Mrs Sanderson's case this meant that the ED clinician had to wait for it to be carried out and then assess the CT scan without the report;

4.  The inquest heard evidence from a trauma specialist about the importance of recognising ""silver trauma"". There was recognition amongst trauma specialists of the high risk of significant trauma amongst elderly patients such as Mrs Sanderson even from what could appear to be relatively minor incidents. As a consequence major trauma centres generally had developed protocols that assisted staff at triage to pick up such cases and prioritise them and set a low threshold for an early CT scan. Such protocols were not generally in force in DGH settings. The evidence was that there needed to be steps taken to increase awareness amongst DGH ED staff to pick up these potential silver trauma cases on arrival in order to expedite discussion with and transfer to a trauma centre and increase the chances of survival.","On 12th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Celia Sanderson. The investigation concluded on the 12th January 2023 and the conclusion was one of Narrative: Died from injuries sustained in a road traffic collision where there was a delay in identifying the severity of the injuries sustained. 

The medical cause of death was 
1a) Acute Myocardial Infarction;

As a consequence she suffered a head injury and was taken to Broomfield General Hospital. Subsequently she was diagnosed with a subarachnoid haemorrhage and after consultation with Addenbrookes, it was confirmed that her injury was not operable and not survivable. Doris Smith was placed on an end-of-life care pathway care plan and passed away on 14 October 2020. The falls risk assessment was only completed 12 days after Doris's admission onto Ruby Ward. Under policy guidelines and procedures it should have been completed within 24 hours after admission by the nurse. It was finally completed by a senior healthcare assistant instead but had an incomplete medical history. Subsequent errors and omissions with regard to the updates of the falls risk assessment 

- No evidence of the physiotherapist's advice of close monitoring during mobilsation being implemented by staff.
- Confusion regarding observation levels e.g 1,2 or 3 and inadequate frequency of both neurological and ward observations.

Doris Joyce Smith died as a direct result of the fall on Ruby Ward on the 9th October 2020. Had Mrs Smith been observed and monitored as she should have been, the fall on 9th October 2020 would either have been avoided or there would have been a staff member present to break her fall. Had the fall been broken, it is likely that Mrs Smith would have avoided injury, or her injuries would have been less severe. The fall suffered by Mrs Smith on 9 th October 2020 caused her to suffer a traumatic subarachnoid haemorrhage, which led to her death on 14th October 2020. In addition, the falls risk assessment and the level of observations were inadequate. There is no evidence of effective communication between the different professionals as to the correct care Doris Smith should be receiving. As well as the lack of implementation of correct and accurate record keeping. Evidence heard as to inconsistencies between staff on Ruby Ward as to which were the correct levels of observations, especially following the falls on the 1 st , 8th and 9th October 2020. All of these factors led to the incorrect observation of Doris Smith which contributed to the circumstances leading to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -

(1) Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust staff:
a. delayed the completion of a falls risk assessment
b. completed the falls risk assessment with inaccurate information to assess Doris Smith's risk and updates were also inaccurate
c. did not follow the advice of the physiotherapist that would have required Doris Smith to mobilise only with assistance of staff and whether her level of observations should have been changed.

(2) Neurological observations following a sustained head injury were not completed as required

(3) Doris Smith had falls on the ward and her level of observations was not reconsidered in light of advice from the physiotherapist after each fall.

(4) The Trust Observation Policy is used in different therapeutic settings and is confusing as to the Levels of Observation required and the focus is on risk for mental health rather then physical healthcare issues that may arise.

Quality of record keeping:
a.The Trust medical records recording system is electronic and evidence was heard that the window on the screen used for staff to type their records is very small and difficult to use.
b.There were significant examples of cut and paste including out-of- date information recorded in the medical records.

(6) Lack of effective communication as to the care and treatment required for Doris Smith between Trust staff and the levels of observations required to keep her safe on the ward","On 23 October 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of Doris Joyce SMITH, aged 74 years.

Mr Seaby was assessed by a Speech and Language Therapist [""SALT""]. A SALT Care Plan was in place with regard to his nutrition which included specific requirements that he be given only soft, moist and mashed food, with two specific exceptions and that he was to be supervised throughout meals on a one-to-one basis with a ten minute gap between food and drink and for ten minutes afterwards. The Care Plan stated it was ""essential"" the Plan was adhered to and specifically provided that if the requirements were not adhered to, Mr Seaby was at risk of aspiration and asphyxiation ""which are potentially life threatening"". Evidence was heard that Mr Seaby was not always given food which complied with the Care Plan and he was not always provided with supervision in compliance with his Care Plan. On 21 May 2018, Mr Seaby's food at lunchtime was not prepared in accordance with the SALT Care Plan. Mr Seaby was not provided with the required one to one supervision during the lunchtime meal. During lunch Mr Seaby coughed while eating and brought some food back up. He cleared his throat and then appeared fine and finished the rest of his meal. At afternoon snack Mr Seaby brought up large amounts of phlegm and then coughed up anything he ate or drank. Mr Seaby was taken to see the General Practitioner by a member of staff who had not been with Mr Seaby during that day. No copy of Mr Seaby's Daily Record was shown to the General Practitioner. Mr Seaby was given a working diagnosis of gastric reflux and his medication was changed. At teatime, Mr Seaby coughed/vomited his medication and yoghurt and drink. Mr Seaby vomited phlegm on two more occasions. The 111 service was called at 20.53 hours.

Many steps have been taken in the period following Mr Seaby's death. However there remain areas of concern

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. Evidence was heard at the inquest of the ""informal approach"" taken with regard to arrangements as to who would provide supervision of residents, including on a one to one basis and who would cook and prepare their meals, including those residents who were subject to a specific SALT dietary plan. Evidence was also heard of steps which have been put in place since Mr Seaby's death to provide written staff rotas for such matters, prepared by Team Leaders and Deputy Managers. However, despite these steps being taken, evidence was also heard at the inquest from staff, who continue to provide care at Oaks and Woodcroft Care Home, referring to providing care on an ""informal basis"" and that this ""works"".

2. It was not clear from the evidence that the staffing levels at Oaks and Woodcroft Care Home are sufficient to provide care for residents, including those requiring one to one supervision and supervision out of the Home and to cover individual activities

3. Mr Seaby died in 2018 and this is the second inquest into Mr Seaby's death. There has still been no internal review carried out following Mr Seaby's death which was unexpected. No Manager was present throughout the inquest and when some elements of evidence were put in dealing with Regulation 28 matters there was some surprise at some of the points raised and evidence heard during the course of the inquest.","On 06 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Peter Gary SEABY aged 63.

The vehicle lift had been installed by Liftmaster Ltd, and was last serviced some 9 months before the incident, by Liftmaster Servicing. The lift had not been serviced in accordance with the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998, nor maintained in accordance with guidance in the lift's installation and operating manual, and contained grade 4.8 bolts not intended to have been in use at that time.

On 28.11.2018, Ashley used the vehicle lift to raise a Volvo S80 car using the outermost lift points, on or near the metal sill that formed the front user jacking points.

As Ashley worked on the car, the alignment of the pads and the freeplay within the arms of the vehicle lift contributed to the frame contact pads moving from beneath a structural part of the car to a non-structural part that could not support the vehicle. This led to the car falling, causing Ashley fatal injuries.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. - Concerns directed to Bendpak Inc CONCERNS

Freeplay:
1. Evidence was given that it could be possible to reduce the degree of freeplay in Bendpak 2-post vehicle lifts. Given lift points positioned close to the edge of the vehicle may be in danger of allowing lifting pads / frame contact pads on the Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lift and possibly other similar 2-post lifts, to move from a position under the structure of the vehicle, to a non-structural part of the vehicle, with a risk of the car leaving the vehicle lift, it appears the level of tolerated freeplay creates a risk of injury or death to those operating the lift.

Lift pad adapter:
2. It is unclear whether a narrow vehicle lift point is suitable for 2-post vehicle lifts using frame contact pads, or whether a better fitted lifting pad adaptor is available. Evidence was provided by an HSE expert engineer, that some form of slotted vehicle lift pad would be better suited when using a 2-post vehicle lift to raise a car by way of the narrow outer lift points that are more often used with vehicle jacks.

Warnings:
3. There are no warnings on the Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lift or in its installation and operation manual, that suggests caution or a prohibition on using a 2-post vehicle lift in conjunction with the outer most lift points on the underside of vehicles, that may be positioned on or near the sill or seam of the vehicle and often within a few inches from a non-structural part of the vehicle for lifting purposes.

Manuals:
4. At the point of providing suppliers / installers with the lift, Bendpak did not require any form of written confirmation of acknowledgment that suppliers received all manuals that Bendpak intended to provide, and considered important to the operation of the lift. It was unclear whether all such manuals were in fact provided.

Evidence was provided by the Bendpak CEO[REDACTED], that if he had known the XPR9 lift had grade 4.8 bolts in the gear ring, he would have considered it required being taken out of service unless and until those bolts were replaced by grade 8.8 bolts.
Bendpak issued, and Liftmaster supplied to its engineers, a Technical Service Bulletin Bendpak TSB 42-10201, that related to replacing the gear ring and bolts in lifts manufactured between 01.01.2010 and 01.01.2014, that may have replaced all grade
4.8 bolts with grade 8.8 bolts, and yet the XPR9 lift in question was manufactured on 14.07.2014 and still had slotted holes and a mixture of grade 4.8 bolts and grade 8.8 bolts on 28.11.2018.

Gear ring bolts:
5.There was no evidence as to whether all Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lifts with grade 4.8 bolts had been recalled or whether grade 4.8 bolts had been replaced in all existing XPR9 lifts, nor any evidence as to what efforts had made to contact customers that might still have such lifts in operation, in order to replace grade 4.8 bolts in lifts manufactured after 01.01.2014.

6.The specification of the grade and size and torque settings of gear ring bolts provided by Bendpak prior to installation was not sufficiently clear within Bendpak's installation and operation manual, and appeared to cause confusion amongst engineers tasked with installing the lift and those required to service or maintain the lift.

7.It is not clear within Bendpak's installation and operation manual as to which components and bolts in particular, are the subsequent lift owner's responsibility to maintain.

Concerns directed to Liftmaster Ltd and Liftmaster Servicing
CONCERNS

Advice to lift owners:
1.There was little evidence of consistent practice amongst Liftmaster workers regarding informing the owners of vehicle lifts of the need to read the installation and operation manual, or in highlighting the important parts of the manual such as the need to tighten gear ring bolts. Liftmaster workers were not always aware that tightening a 'safety-critical' component such as gear ring bolts, were the customer's responsibility, and hence that was not communicated to customers.

Engineers reading the installation and operation manual:
2. An experienced Liftmaster employee gave clear evidence that he did not read all of the installation and operating manual for the XPR9 lift, in spite of being said to have received refresher training from his employer less than 5 months before giving evidence. He said he was not required to read the manual when he was trained, even though he had also signed a letter confirming that he had in fact read the manuals for the XPR series. At the time of giving evidence, he was unaware of the torque table and the full extent of the lift maintenance requirements within the installation and operation manual, notwithstanding the fact that tightening of gear ring bolts was considered by all relevant witnesses, to be critical to the safety of the vehicle lift. That employee was said to be presently employed by Liftmaster and Liftmaster was said to presently install and service Bendpak lifts.

Physical clearance surrounding lifts:
3. Photographs suggested the clearances recommended by the manufacturer, between the lift posts and the nearest obstruction, were not maintained at the time of the incident. Those clearances were said to be 13 feet at the front of the lift, 11 feet at the rear of the lift, and 5 inches from the sides to the nearest wall. Photographs taken very shortly after the incident, disclose the presence of a different vehicle within just a few feet of the rear of the lift used by Ashley in a neighbouring XPR9 vehicle lift / lift bay. It is unclear to what degree the recommended clearance requirements within the manufacturer's installation and operating manual were considered or adhered to at installation.

Concerns directed to Precision Bodyshop Ltd, formerly Wheel Art Ltd
CONCERNS

Adherence to operating manual:
1. There was no evidence that Wheel Art Ltd ever required vehicle technicians operating the Bendpak XPR9 lift, to read the installation and operating manual or to maintain the lift in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. I am informed that Precision no longer owns any Bendpak XPR9 lifts, but instead uses Hoffman scissor lifts. This concern is not focussed on the make or model of lift but the use of lift operating manuals.

Maintenance records:
2. There was no evidence that Wheel Art Ltd ever kept records of inspections, maintenance, or repair of the Bendpak XPR9 lifts in accordance with the Bendpak XPR9 installation and operating manual. Again, whilst Wheel Art Ltd may now use different vehicle lifts, this concern is not focussed on the make or model of lift but on the maintenance of relevant records.

Concern directed to vehicle manufacturers and associations
(a) Volvo Car Corporation
(b) International Organization of Motor Vehicle manufacturers (OICA)
(c)The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA) 

CONCERN
Outer lift points used with Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lifts:
1.Volvo (and/or other manufacturers) appear to designate lift points towards the edge of vehicles, that are near, on, or outside the sill or seam of the underside of the vehicle. Lift points in a position so close to the edge of a vehicle frame, appear to be in danger of allowing frame contact pads on a Bendpak XPR9 2-post vehicle lift, and possibly other similar 2-post vehicle lifts, to move from a position under the structure of the vehicle, to a non-structural part of the vehicle, due to tolerated freeplay within the vehicle lift, leading to a risk of the car leaving the vehicle lift. Whilst multiple lift points are identified in manuals and/or on Autodata, no warning is given with regards to any danger of using 2-post vehicle lifts on the outer most lift points.

Concern directed to The British Standards Institution
CONCERN
British Standards on the degree of tolerated freeplay in 2-post vehicle lifts:
1. There appear to be no British Standards for the safe, acceptable and/or tolerated degree of travel or length of travel in terms of freeplay in 2-post vehicle lifts in the UK. Whilst evidence was provided by the HSE that the industry body SAFed suggested an acceptable degree of freeplay is the diameter of the vehicle lift's frame contact pad, it is noted that various 2-post vehicle lifts have different diameter pads, and hence there is no consistency in the amount of freeplay tolerated in 2- post vehicle lifts. It was also noted that the diameter of pad in the present case, at 130mm, could allow a frame contact pad, to move from a position underneath the structure of a vehicle, to a position under a non-structural part of the vehicle, which
can cause the vehicle to leave the lift. An HSE engineer's expert evidence was that it might be more sensible for tolerated freeplay to not exceed half the diameter of the frame contact pad.","The inquest into the death of Mr Ashley Bullard, aged 32, was opened on 6th December 2018. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20th December 2022.

1a Head injury  

The jury's Narrative conclusion to the inquest was: 
The car was placed by Ashley on outer pick up points, which was one of the set of points recommended by both Volvo and 'Autodata', the industry standard software. The lift was examined after the incident. A feature of the lift, namely freeplay within the arms, contributed to the car not being held by the lift. The combination of the alignment of the pads on the pick up points, the work being carried out on the car and the freeplay within the lift arms contributed to the car falling and as a result caused the death of Ashley Michel Bullard.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisations have the power to take such action in relation to the concerns above.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 8th March 2023.

There was no specific instruction to place a Low ACT (as opposed to a Medium / High stop ACT) and no discussion about which priority to place on the said ACT. The available evidence established that 'LOW' would probably have been placed on the ACT by default.

(5) Meanwhile Hannah had travelled in her vehicle down to Brighton, along the south coast as far as Exeter, and then north towards Weston Super Mare, before rejoining the M5.

(6) A call from Avon and Somerset Police into the MPS shortly after 10.00pm notified them of an ANPR activation for Hannah's vehicle inbound to Weston Super Mare. Avon and Somerset requested further details from the MPS.

(7) A second call just over one hour later notified the MPS that the vehicle was heading back out towards the motorway and again requested further details from the MPS.

(8) A third call from Gwent Police into the MPS shortly before 02.45am on 4 February 2016 made a similar request information in relation to the ACT instruction.

(9) Hannah's journey generated no fewer than 27 activations on the ANPR system, the last at about 03.25am in Margam, Port Talbot.

(10) The ANPR Bureau were not contacted by the MPS during this time.

(11) At around 03.25am Hannah entered the Port Talbot harbour site via a private road.
Her body was found in the lock entrance to the harbour shortly after 9am on 4 February 2016 and her car located underwater in the harbour itself by South Wales Police divers.

(12) During the inquest the MPS accepted five shortcomings with respect to the missing person investigation for Hannah. These shortcomings were recorded in Box 3 of the Record of Inquest. They were:

""(1) On the overnight response team shift, which received the handover from Inspector [REDACTED], there was a lack of action taken to progress the missing person investigation.
(2)There was insufficient and insufficiently timely use of the ANPR Bureau by officers investigating the missing person investigation.
(3)There was a failure to contact Hannah's family, in particular to check whether Hannah had any known family or friends in the West of England.
(4)There was shortcoming in the flow of communication from the calls received into the Metropolitan Police made by regional Police forces to the response team investigating the missing person investigation.
(5)The ACT placed on the Police National Computer directing a stop of the vehicle driven by Hannah was marked as a Low grade, when it could have been marked as a Medium grade.""","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) The evidence was clear that the most effective means of locating a missing person in Hannah's position was to locate the vehicle in which it was assumed she was travelling;
(2) There was an apparent mismatch between the COMPACT risk assessment for Hannah graded as ""medium"" and the LOW stop priority instruction on ACT in relation to her vehicle.
(3) The evidence I and the jury heard was that there was no formal guidance, training, or protocols of any kind to assist with the dialogue between these two systems; instead, it was left to local custom and practice as to how to correlate any risk assessment with the priority instruction on the ACT, if at all.
(4) The preponderance of the evidence was that the LOW stop instruction was inappropriate in this case, but I was not directed to any document or guidance that would have assisted those responsible at the time for selecting the correct priority on the ACT.
(5) I have seen no evidence of any formal guidance, training, or protocols as to how these two critically important systems are meant to operate alongside one another safely, or at all.
(6) This appears to be a national issue and is not related solely to the lack of any formal guidance, training, or protocols within the MPS specifically.","On 15 FEBRUARY 2016 the Senior Coroner commenced an investigation into the death of HANNAH WARREN aged 28 (hereafter ""Hannah"").

Cattle in the field approached them, knocked them down and trampled them, causing serious injuries. Emergency treatment was provided by a doctor who arrived by helicopter. Mr Holmes could not be revived and was pronounced dead at 12:56 that day at the scene of the incident.","During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 
 
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  
1. Considerations regarding the field where the fatality occurred. 
 
1.1. In an incident on 29 September 2020 Mr Holmes died after being trampled by cattle. His wife sustained major spinal and other injuries. It was a catastrophe for their family. The couple were walking on a public footpath which ran through the middle of a large field. It occurred as they were on a lunchtime walk at a time when they were working from home due to the Covid pandemic. 
 
1.2. Statistics from the Health & Safety Executive ('HSE') indicate that on average 6 people have died each year from injuries sustained in cattle trampling incidents. 11 people died in 2020, one of whom was Mr Holmes. Such incidents are avoidable if walkers and cattle are separated. In my judgment, this unacceptable situation necessitates a review of the arrangements in which walkers are brought into contact with cows and their calves, by virtue of rights of way.

1.3. The field in which the incident occurred (the 'incident field') had been used to graze cattle for over 50 years. The public footpath had existed since the National Parks & Access to the Countryside Act 1949 recorded its existence. The logic for the precise path through the incident field has been lost in the mists of time.

1.4. Following the fatal incident, the farmer made a formal application dated 12 January 2021, to divert the public footpath to the edge of the incident field and erect a suitable fence, so as to create a safe corridor which separates walkers from the cattle (the 'application'). All the witnesses who gave evidence at the inquest endorsed the wisdom of the application. One described it as ""essential.""

1.5. As objections have been lodged to the application, the matter must be resolved by way of a public enquiry. The Secretary of State is asked to ensure the decision maker in such a process is aware of the unanimous views expressed in the course of the inquest. The application may well eliminate altogether the risk identified in the incident field.

2. The general position in relation to dogs on Rights of Way

2.1. HSE Information sheet No 17EW (rev1) published 05/19 states the two most common factors in trampling incidents are cows with calves and walkers with dogs. Mr & Mrs Holmes had two dogs on leads at the time. The inquest heard evidence about four previous incidents in the incident field, three of which involved walkers accompanied by dogs. There appears to be a strong correlation between trampling incidents and walkers with dogs.

2.2. The conclusion to be drawn is that cows with calves and dogs do not mix well, particularly when the calves are young.

2.3. Evidence was given at the inquest to the effect that dogs are regarded as a 'usual accompaniment' and are thus entitled to be brought onto a Right of Way. This proposition lacks clarity. There is also uncertainty as to whether dogs are required to be on a lead when on a public footpath.

2.4. Consideration should be given in the HSE Information Sheet to a clarification of the legal position of dogs brought onto rights of way where it is foreseeable they will interact with cows and their young calves.

3. The power to restrict dogs on public footpaths, at certain times.

3.1. It is difficult to predict whether a particular cow will react aggressively to the presence of a dog in a field. It was suggested during the inquest, the risk of such a reaction is highest in the months after the birth of a calf.

3.2. To neutralise this risk, consideration should be given to empowering Local Authority Footpath officers (on an application made by a farmer in relation to an identified field), to prohibit dogs being taken onto the field for a specified period. In short, a temporary prohibition order. The rationale for a temporary expedient of this nature is the imperative to protect the safety of the public, when set against the relatively brief interference with any right a walker may have to be accompanied by a dog.

3.3. An alternative approach would be to authorise landowners to post notices at the entrance to particular fields, alerting walkers to the presence of cows with young calves and advising them not to bring dogs into the field (whether on a lead or not)
between specified dates. The objective of preventing harm may not, however, be achieved if walkers ignore the advice or the suggested signs are vandalised.

3.4 It is acknowledged that statutory change would be required to create powers of this nature. The Secretary of State will doubtless reflect upon the balance to be struck between the imperative of protecting the safety of the public and the relatively brief interference this would impose on the right of walkers to bring their dog into any field affected. It should also be borne in mind that the people whose safety is currently jeopardised under existing arrangements are the dog walkers themselves.

4. The role of public bodies.

4.1. The current potential for a hazard to be created by walkers on public footpaths moving in proximity to a farmer's grazing cattle, requires management of these competing interests. It was contended at the inquest that the farmer is subject to a statutory duty to carry out a risk assessment in accordance with the Management of Health & Safety at Work Regulations 1999. It was contended that a landowner must conduct his business around the existing public footpath, irrespective of which came into existence first. Whilst not disputing the legal duty imposed on a farmer in these circumstances, the potential mischief left unguarded in that analysis, is that Small & Medium Enterprises (SME's) such as small family farms may lack the expertise to recognise the problem, carry out an effective risk assessment in relation to cattle trampling risks and devise reasonably practicable control measures.

4.2. To avoid the harm envisaged by further deaths in comparable circumstances, the HSE and Local Authorities should explore ways to apply their expertise in collaboration with landowners (of the type involved in this inquest), whether on a
paid or voluntary basis. The maintenance of safe public rights of way could be said to require oversight and management by public bodies as well as the landowners concerned

4.3 One example of pragmatic help to eliminate cattle trampling risks would be for the HSE to draw attention to the process available under section 119 of the Highways Act 1980 to apply for a public footpath to be re-routed, so as to separate cows with calves and walkers. Consideration could be given to highlighting this option in a future edition of the HSE Information Sheet.

4.4. This report will be sent to special interest groups thought to have an interest in this issue, in the hope of enlisting their assistance in educating all who use the countryside in relation to the risk and the ways in which it could be eliminated.","On 1 October 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael John Holmes, aged 57.

-Zachary had a history of mental illness from childhood. His diagnosed conditions of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder required care tailored to his neurodiverse needs. Concern was expressed by two Consultant Psychiatrists who cared for him in life, and the Court appointed Expert Consultant Psychiatrist, regarding the lack of consideration for those with neurodiverse conditions in the care options available, and the lack of availability of appropriate therapies;

- Inpatient mental health units adversely affect those with neurodiverse conditions since they require calm and structure. There are no inpatient options tailored to patients with neurodiverse conditions presenting in acute crisis;

-Home Treatment Teams do not offer continuity of staff or set appointment times, as they are a crisis team allocated according to demand. This stability is required by those suffering from ASD;

-There is a lack of availability of psychological interventions, being the main treatment for neurodiverse conditions, including art therapy, Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS) (Zachary was placed on a waiting list)

Consideration should be given to whether any steps can be taken to address the above concerns.","The inquest into the death of Zachary KLEMENT was opened on 18th March 2021. Evidence was heard between 4th and 6th October 2022, and it was concluded on 2nd December 2022.  

I found the medical cause of death to be: 
1a. Suspension 

I determined that Zachary took his own life by suspension during a crisis of deteriorating mental health and increasing suicidal ideation. I recorded a narrative conclusion, detailing the following:
On 2nd March 2021, Zachary Klement was found suspended in his bedroom at his supported living accommodation in Woking, Surrey, and was pronounced deceased by attending paramedics at 19:37. He had a long history of mental health issues from childhood and was diagnosed with Autistic Spectrum Disorder, Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, general anxiety disorder and Bipolar Affective Disorder.

On 26th January 2021, Zachary was admitted to Farnham Road Hospital as an informal patient following an escalation in his self-harm and suicidal ideation. He was discharged back to his supported living accommodation on 1st February 2021, initially under the care of the Home Treatment Team and then the Community Mental Health Recovery Service. He continued to have fluctuating mood and episodes of self-harm, and he sought help from Safe Haven and the Psychiatric Liaison Service at St Peter's Hospital on 4th, 22nd, 24th and 28th February.

On the last occasion, 28th February 2021, he expressed concern he could not keep himself safe. He requested inpatient admittance and then agreed to Home Treatment Team care before changing his mind. On this occasion his immediate risk was assessed as low and he was discharged back to the Community Mental Health Team. This was a missed opportunity to contain and manage his risk whilst exploring his needs.

The lack of availability of psychological therapies and resources tailored to the needs of patients with Autistic Spectrum Disorder which could be offered to Zachary by Surrey & Borders Partnership NHS Foundation Trust also represented a missed opportunity to provide therapeutic care.

On the afternoon of 2nd March, Zachary sent a text message to his Care Coordinator stating that he wanted to discharge himself from mental health services as he felt they were not helping him.

Mr Parsons had spent the evening of Friday 22 April 2022 at the Porthleven Food Festival. He had been due to meet up with his wife at a rented holiday cottage in Porthleven on the morning of Saturday 23 April 2022. He failed to meet her as planned and was uncontactable.

The police search revealed that Mr Parsons was last seen just before midnight on 22 April 2022 by a witness in the in the big tent at the harbour. The witness stated that Mr Parsons did not seem to be drunk at the time that they were speaking.

On 4 May 2022 the fully clothed body of Mr Parsons was recovered from the sea, approximately 4 miles off the coast of the Isles of Scilly after being spotted by a fisherman.

The post-mortem revealed no injuries and gave the cause of death identified above. Toxicology shows raised urine ethanol (alcohol) at 291 mg / 100 ML. For comparison, the legal driving limit alcohol in urine is 107 mg / 100 ML urine.

The Inquest findings were as follows
· Mr Parsons died after midnight, on 23 April 2023 after falling into the harbour waters and drowning.
· Due to Mr Parsons body being located fully clothed, he fell into the water by accident and not through choice.
That if Mr Parsons was still conscious and was able to shout for help, he is unlikely to have been heard by anyone due to the noise of the ongoing events.
· The alcohol consumed by Mr Parsons made it more likely that when entering the water this would increase the risk of drowning due to impairment of cognition and motor skills.
· Police evidence revealed that the sea off Porthleven features a notorious current that means it is not safe to swim in the harbour.
· The pier and harbour walls raised safety issues discussed below under matters of concern. The police evidence was that these safety issues amounted to a failing to ensure the safety of members of the public.
Responsibility for public safety rests with the Porthleven Harbour & Dock Company as the owners of the harbour, and with Cornwall Council as the licensing authority for the Food Festival.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.

There were safety issues revealed at Porthleven Harbour, particularly in the evening when festival goers will have been drinking alcohol. Sections of the harbour wall feature sheer drops into water with no railings and trip hazards. The pier presents a particular risk due the absence of railings on one side with a sheer drop into water, and being poorly lit. For anyone falling from the pier, swimming to safety will be difficult due to current and the absence of access ladders or refuge area. The pier is sometimes closed to access by the public but was not closed at the time of the festival.","On 10 May 2022, I commenced an investigation into the death of James Francis PARSONS.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

Ms Campbell had experienced a work-place related accident approximately 20 years prior to her death when she had fallen off a broken chair at work. She suffered with back pain, which became chronic, thereafter. She had a number of interventions including referral and attendance at pain clinics, manual therapy, CBT and pharmaceuticals.
During her time with pain no clear cause was identified on MRI and other imaging. She was treated for chronic low back pain of indeterminate cause.
Over the years she was treated with multiple, and escalating doses of, medications. These included at the time of her death, diazepam [REDACTED], amitriptyline [REDACTED], tramadol [REDACTED], gabapentin [REDACTED] and fentanyl patches[REDACTED] to be applied every 72 hours.
She was found collapsed at home in her bathroom and there was a possibility of a positional component to the respiratory depression consequent on the long-lie. The medical cause of death was given by the pathologist[REDACTED] as 1a Central Respiratory Depression 1b Tramadol excess with fentanyl II Long lie following a fall, chronic post traumatic back injury.
The police and paramedics attending the scene describe the finding of ""hundreds"" of packets of medications, some opened, some unopened.
This polypharmacy was identified by the pathologist who conducted the post mortem (taking from the toxicology report) as ""In summary, excess Tramadol [REDACTED] and a metabolite [REDACTED] are indicative of recent moderately excessive ingestion prior to death. Although lower than levels typically seen in fatalities, the moderate excess in conjunction with other prescribed drugs, most notably fentanyl are sufficient to have produced central respiratory depression. No other significant post mortem findings were noted, and the prolonged lie following a fall may well have contributed a postural component to the respiratory depression""
Her GP [REDACTED] gave clear and candid evidence. I accept the management of patients who describe intractable debilitating pain is challenging and difficult and that requests for other or increasing doses of medication can be difficult to resist.[REDACTED] agreed that the prescribing of the various drugs identified had potential to be dangerous. He told me that after a certain point the benefits of increasing or adding doses or medications in terms of pain relief were minimal. This scenario seems to be an invidious one for GP's and patients alike.
[REDACTED] told me that subsequent to Ms Campbell's death the practice had convened and discussed the circumstances and agreed on regular reviews for patients taking these sorts of medication. There were no plans identified to actively look for these patients and to work to rationalize and / or reduce their medications.
I am of the view that polypharmacy including gabapentinoids and opiates represents a severe safety risk in patients with a iatrogenic drug dependency. I consider that the risk in individuals like Ms Campbell of an inadvertent overdose of medications which have a cumulative and synergistic effect to depress the central nervous system can easily become extreme and lead to death. There have been a number of deaths in the Milton Keynes, Bedfordshire and Luton areas related to concomitant use of high dose and combination gabapentinoids and opioids.","On 04 July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Jacqueline Sharman CAMPBELL aged 56. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 February 2023. The conclusion of the inquest was that:  

Ms Jacqueline Sharman Campbell died on the 30th June 2022 at her home address. She had battled chronic backpain for more than 20 years. It was difficult to manage. She was prescribed large doses of gabapentin, tramadol and amitriptyline. She was also prescribed fentanyl patches and oral diazepam. She likely inadvertently overdosed on tramadol and that, in combination with the other medicines, all possessing the ability to depress the central nervous system, had the synergistic effect of causing respiratory depression and death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by April 19, 2023.

•diabetes (type 2) diagnosed 1999
•chronic kidney disease, from 2012
•diverticular disease from 2012
•raised BMI, at times over 30,
•myasthenia gravis (MG), symptoms identified from around April 2020,

John was prescribed steroids from December 2020 for MG, escalating to the highest recommended dose of 100mg prednisolone, taken every other day. John received this high dose from 21 February 2021 until his death on 26 June 2021. That is with the exception of a period between 7 and 13 June 2021 following an inadvertent reduction in dosage to 25mg whilst an in-patient at RCHT. John was discharged on 15 June 2021 after this dosage error. I found that John was medically fit at the time of discharge and that the dosage error did not contribute to his cause of death.

John was re-admitted on 22 June with a history of vomiting and retching for 2 days before admission; I found on the evidence that this was the likely period when John suffered his perforated sigmoid colon. This was deemed inoperable. John did not respond to antibiotics and was discharged home on 25 June 2021 for palliative care. John died peacefully at home on 26 June 2021.

I found on the evidence of the histopathologist[REDACTED], that steroid therapy was contributory to John's cause of death, alongside John's other conditions. I found on the evidence that it was not possible to distinguish between the multiple conditions contributing to, and causative of, the perforated bowel.

[REDACTED] stated in evidence as follows:

…steroid therapy increases the risks of gastrointestinal complications including ulceration and perforation of the stomach, duodenum and the colon and these are recognised complications documented in the literature. The mechanism is unclear but steroids are thought to impair the mucosal barrier which enables bacteria to penetrate. Steroid induced colonic perforation is more likely to occur in patients with diverticular disease and the deceased was noted at autopsy to suffer from diverticular disease. It is speculated that in diverticular disease there is a localised concentration of bacteria.
Also, if the patient is treated by high dose steroids, the signs and symptoms of gastrointestinal and colonic complications may be masked by the anti-inflammatory effects of the drugs. This may potentially lead to delays in identification of the drug induced complications, so potentially resulting in the patient presenting with advanced complications such as viscus perforation.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) Royal Cornwall Hospital (RCHT)
· The concern is the inadvertent reduction of steroid dosage and the arrangements made in relation to the administration of medication dosages and the policies regarding dosage errors, and the application of those policies.
·The Court heard that the dosage of 100mg prednisolone was inadvertently reduced to 25mg from 7 to 13 June. The full dose of 100mg was given either side of that period, on 5 and 15 June 2021. No explanation was offered for this reduction other than it being an inadvertent mistake.
·RCHT Consultants accepted that the dosage error was a serious mistake. Furthermore, this mistake was not drawn to the patient John's attention or to the attention of the GP via the discharge summary, which made no reference to the dosage error. It was unclear whether treating physicians or discharging physicians were aware of the dosage error.

(2) The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE)
· The concern is regarding the accuracy and rigour of the British National Formulary (BNF) guidance on Prednisolone, published by NICE, The National Institute for Clinical Excellence
·BNF provides Key information on the selection, prescribing, dispensing and administration of medicines. The BNF aims to provide prescribers, pharmacists, and other healthcare professionals with sound up-to-date information about the use of medicines.
·Evidence was taken at Inquest from a consultant neurologist that recent literature suggests an association between steroids (such as prednisolone) and the risk of bowel perforation in those with diverticular disease. This is not reflected in the BNF guidance regarding prednisolone.
·In relation to a number of sections in the Prednisolone guidance it was found as follows
·The 'Important safety information' section does not refer to the risk of perforation from using corticosteroids for those with diverticular disease
·The 'Contra-indications For all corticosteroids (systemic)' section does not refer to need for caution in using corticosteroids for those with diverticular disease, albeit it does refer to caution in using with patients with diabetes mellitus and diverticulitis
·The 'Side effects' section makes no reference to bowel perforation as a risk, albeit it does make reference to peptic ulceration.","On 22 July 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of John Alfred Roberts. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 April 2023.

She was successfully treated with chemo/radiotherapy. She was referred to Tameside General Hospital for a post treatment endoscopy. In December 2021 an endoscopy identified a tight pinhole stricture. A stent was inserted as it was suspected that there was a perforation. The type of stent inserted required removal within 6 weeks in a case such as Mrs Lomax's.  

A combination of factors including clinicians not communicating effectively and no ownership of Mrs Lomax's case meant that the stent was not removed within 6 weeks. An attempt to remove the stent on 22nd March was unsuccessful because the stent was embedded due to the time that had elapsed since it was inserted.  

This was not urgently escalated although it was recognised this was a complex situation with potentially significant consequences for Mrs Lomax. She was scheduled to begin a complex stent removal process on 22nd June 2022. An operation at Salford Royal Hospital did not take place because the preoperative procedure was not followed. She had a series of bleeds in June 2022 that culminated with her being admitted to Stepping Hill Hospital on 19th June 2022. Her haemoglobin level was low. She developed pneumonia from the complications of the oesophageal granulation of the stent. She was treated with antibiotics but continued to deteriorate.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
1. The inquest heard evidence that the development of oesophageal strictures such as Mrs Lomax's was a relatively new development as a consequence of advances in chemo/radiotherapy that meant that surgery was not the only option for oesophageal cancers. However the management of theses strictures was complicated and there was no detailed national guidance on management of them and in particular when and how stenting should be approached. The development and implementation of detailed National Guidance was the inquest was told key to improving outcomes for patients such as Mrs Lomax across England;

2. Within Greater Manchester the inquest was told that the Christie were seeking to develop a specialist service for these complex cases but funding of a commissioned pan GM service was fundamental to a successful roll out that would benefit such patients as Mrs Lomax. The absence of such a service meant that cases such as Mrs Lomax's could arise going forward given that in most hospitals even experienced radiologists/gastroenterologists would have limited experience on how to manage such cases;

3. The inquest also heard evidence that to support management of cases such as Mrs Lomax there was a regular GM Upper GI MDT led by Salford Royal Hospital. However staffing issues meant that there was not a regular presence for all Trusts at the meeting. This impacted effective communication and impacted patient care;

This was compounded by the fact that the inquest heard evidence that the MDT did not have a system of effective communication of agreed actions and recommendations for individual patients discussed at the MDT. As a consequence local clinicians were unsighted as to the recommended way forward. The inquest was told that an effective and consistent pan GM approach to sharing the outcomes of MDTs would improve patient outcomes.","On 30th June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sandra Adina Lomax.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:
i. On the 30th May 2021 a carpet of grass was obstructing the entire north bound carriageway of Coombe Road, Winterbourne Steepleton, Dorchester for a distance of 60 metres. This was described as dangerous and a hazard. On that day a road traffic collision occurred as a result of that hazard in which sadly Mr Wood died.
ii. There was evidence that the grass had been seen at approximately 18.00 hours by a member of the public driving on the other side of the road. The collision occurred at approximately 19.13 hours. Between 18.00 hours and 19.13 hours, 3 people working on a local farm transporting sileage from a local field to the farm had seen the grass and had driven over it. Others may also have seen and/or driven over the grass.
iii. No one reported this obstruction in the road prior to the collision. Evidence was given that there is a legal requirement to remove or report any spillage if you cause it, but there is no obligation to report any hazard you see, which you have not caused.
iv. The owner of the farm, who was undertaking sileage transfer in the area at the time, has said that since the incident, if there is any spillage or obstruction he or his employees come across, they will report it, so it can be cleared.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:
i. That there is a lack of knowledge and/or understanding as to when people should report an obstruction in the road. I would request that consideration is given to making all road users aware of the dangers of obstructions in the road and to encourage them to report any hazard to the local Police force or Local Authority so that it can be removed as soon as possible, or at least other road users be warned of the hazard to prevent a future death.","On the 10th June 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Stephen Robert Wood, born on the 18th March 1962.

Mr Twm Bryn had experienced mental health difficulties, including anxiety and low mood since the age of 17. Mr Bryn was referred to Gwynedd Mental Health services after a telephone consultation with his GP on the 26th July 2021. Due to the presence of low mood and anxiety, the referring Dr requested a routine assessment and possibly counselling.  

Mr Bryn lived with family, had good friends and a job that he liked. The referral outlined low mood for a ""few"" years with a deterioration in the last ""few"" months which included feelings of panic, tiredness, poor sleep and appetite with no reported use of illicit substances or excessive alcohol consumption. The referral indicated that Twm Bryn described to the GP feelings ""hitting him like a wall"" when upset and angry, and at times, thoughts of wanting to harm himself and occasional suicidal thoughts.  

An appointment with the Local Primary Mental Health Support Service (""LPMHSS"") was arranged and took place, via telephone assessment, on the 7th September 2021, 40 days after Mr Bryn was seen by the GP (not within the 28 day target set by the Mental Health Measure). The assessment indicated the presence of long-term low mood accompanied by anxiety, poor sleep and appetite. He was assessed as a mild risk of suicide, and no risk of harm to others with no legal/forensic risk. Mr Bryn was not at risk of abuse in his personal relationships nor at home and no safeguarding concerns were identified.  

The primary care assessment was discussed at an Allocation meeting on the 13th September 2021 where a decision was made to offer counselling with the Local Primary Mental Health Support Service. There was a waiting list of several months for the said counselling and save for services to which he would need to self-refer, no interim contact, monitoring or support was discussed or offered to Mr Bryn.  

Mr Bryn died before counselling was made available to him.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) Continued staffing pressures within Primary Mental Health Services resulting in assessment delays and waiting lists for support e.g the waiting list for LPMHSS counselling remains at 4 - 6 months. There was no evidence that the waiting list would improve moving forward

(2) Whilst awaiting counselling, the only interim support available to patients that are assessed as mild or low risk, are services that come with a requirement to self-refer, despite lack of motivation being a common symptom. The LPMHSS does not have a standardised process for referring low risk patients for interim support and no interim contact or monitoring is offered or arranged (unless patients have self-referred to an organisation providing such services).","On the 12th October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Mr Twm Bryn, aged 21.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
It became clear in the inquest that the commission, funding, assessment and provision of care needs is a complex process involving, particularly as in Matthews case, where there are multiple agencies involved due to his own complex and multifaceted needs. In this case it has been established that there was a confusion over the care in how it was funded and expected to be provided, compared to that which was understood to be funded and actually provided on the ground to Matthew. The confusion appears to have arisen over the understanding of a number of care terms and the use of them which has resulted in 2 commissioning agencies and an agency providing the care having differing views about Matthews care and that which should have been in place and that which was in place.","On 07 January 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Matthew Harter DALE aged 43. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 25 January 2023. 

The conclusion of the inquest was that:  
Matthew was a 43 year old male with multifaceted and complex needs. He had significant learning disabilities, autism, visual impairment and bi-polar affective disorder. Matthew lacked capacity to make decisions for himself and was the subject of DOL (deprivation of liberty) safeguards. From an early age Matthew had a propensity to place non-food items into his mouth which presented as a choking risk, these risks continued throughout adulthood but were cyclical in presentation. Matthew resided in sheltered accommodation from 2008 which was deemed no longer able to meet his needs due to an escalation in behaviours which included in part, ingestion of non-food items on 4 separate occasions in short succession in 2010. In February 2011 Matthew moved to Vancouver House. Warrington borough council were the commissioning body for Matthews care and placement until September 2018 when he became eligible for Continuous Health Care funding and the Integrated care board took over that role. Matthew was known to Vancouver House managers on his transition of care to Vancouver House as posing a risk of ingesting non- food items with review in September 2011 noting that Matthew had settled in his placement and the risks associated with that were significantly reduced. Vancouver House changed ownership and with that a change of managers who at the time of Matthews death were not aware of any risks of Matthew ingesting non-food due to no ongoing identification of such risk or assessment of it since November 2011. There were no further incidents of Matthew ingesting non-food items from 2011 until 2020. As part of Matthews multifaceted and complex care plan, there was a system of reviewing Matthews care provision and a protocol for escalation of concerns around safeguarding or meeting his care needs to the agencies and professionals involved in his care. Regular and statutory reviews of Matthews care provision and placement were undertaken. No concerns were raised about risks to Matthew of the ingestion of non-food items or the provision of his care needs. There was a clear misunderstanding between commissioning authorities about Matthew's care needs and the funding and provision of care, commissioners understanding Matthew requiring constant supervision with a provision for 1:1 care 8am-8pm and ongoing waking hours supervision outside of those hours as part of the funding package. The reality was Matthew was provided with 1:1 care 8am-8pm and after that time 1:1 care when eating and hourly observations thereafter that being the assumed regime of care by Vancouver House. On the 15/12/2020 and 26/12/2020 Matthew was noted to have accessed his incontinence pad and had on at least one occasion prior to death ingested part of it. Whilst some staff had an awareness of Matthews risk to put non-food items in his mouth, others did not. Whilst recorded in Matthews daily notes, these concerns were not properly escalated to senior management and this provided a missed opportunity for Matthew to have increased supervision levels on an urgent basis and until a multidisciplinary team meeting could be confirmed to reassess and consider his needs. Had the incidents on the 15 and 26 December have been properly escalated, Matthew would have been on 15 minute observations, he was in fact on hourly observations and when unsupervised Matthew placed a piece of his incontinence in his mouth and swallowed it. As a result, the piece of pad expanded with the saliva and became trapped in his airway. Staff at the home staff engaged backslaps which failed to dislodge the item in question, Matthew was then incontinent of faeces and concerns were turned to attending to his personal needs rather than the serious choking risk and Matthew was taken to his room during which no further attempts were made to dislodge the choking item until his personal care needs had been met. Thereafter abdominal thrusts were noted to be given but ineffective in part due to difficulties undertaking the manoeuvre due to Matthews size and also due it being unlikely that such actions would have in any event dislodged the item. Emergency services were contacted and upon Matthew becoming unconscious CPR was commenced, taken over by paramedics upon arrival. Paramedics were able to remove the piece of pad from Matthews throat by forceps. Matthew died from placing the piece of pad in his mouth during a period in which he was not supervised and in part contributed to by missed opportunity to increase supervision to meet Matthews identified needs.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 23, 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.Mrs Green had a long wait for an ambulance, despite her age and the recognised risks of being on the floor for a prolonged period of time, due to a shortage of ambulances. Mrs Green deteriorated whilst waiting to be taken to hospital. The Inquest heard that the shortage of ambulances was due to a number of factors including high demand and a shortage of crews due to long delays at Emergency Departments (ED) across the Greater Manchester to offload patients;

2. The evidence before the Inquest was that the delay on the day Mrs Green was waiting for an ambulance was not unusual and still remained the case on the day of the Inquest;

3.  The Inquest heard that Mrs Green's wait of 3 hours in ED was not unusual and was due to the volume of patients waiting to be seen and the overall demand on ED. The consequence was that elderly frail patients were receiving treatment that was delayed and in circumstances that were challenging for frail patients.","On 4th July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Patricia Grace Eileen Green.

At the beginning of 2022 he was becoming more frail and suffering from falls leading to hospitalisations. He fell down some stairs at home at some point on 16th May 2022 and was subsequently taken to the James Paget hospital arriving at around 21.30 on 17th May 2022. After some delay in offloading him from an ambulance he was diagnosed as suffering from an unstable cervical spine fracture. There was a delay in seeking senior clinical advice which in turn led to a delay in being able to sit him upright. During this period, he developed pneumonia which was in part due to aspiration whilst nursed immobile and flat in conjunction with his hiatus hernia, influenza A and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was treated with intravenous antibiotics and oxygen therapy but deteriorated and died as a consequence of his multifactorial pneumonia predominately due to the consequences of his fall on a background of frailty and type 2 diabetes mellitus.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. 

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 

(1) Evidence given at the inquest revealed that there was a delay in Mr. Athanasis being transferred from the ambulance into the emergency department at the James Paget hospital as they had no space for him to be transferred into. 

(2) As there had been known delays in obtaining space in the emergency department at the Trust senior clinicians undertook a safety check of those patients left in ambulances to assess the urgency and need for a trolley or bed. 

(3) In this instance the mechanism to undertake a safety check was not sufficient to reveal the extent of the injuries Mr. Athanasis had sustained, and this meant there was a delay in diagnosing him with his unstable cervical fracture. This delay in conjunction with other issues more than minimally or trivially contributed to his death. 

(4) The Emergency department staff gave evidence that they regularly have too many patients in the department and cannot find space to safely allow ambulances to transfer patients into their care and then leave. The staff at the Trust indicated that they did not consider that locally there were any further steps they could take and gave evidence this was a more complex problem, predominately due to the Trust's inability to discharge patients who are medically fit to be discharged and occupying much needed beds. This in turn means that they are unable to move patients from the emergency department to beds in the hospital in a timely manner which leads to them not having capacity to admit patients brought in by ambulances. This clearly means that ambulances are delayed and in turn are unable to attend other emergencies in a timely manner. 

(5) Significant local steps have been taken to reduce the risks to patients, but the department is functioning well over their capacity (at the time of the hearing the Trust had 75 patients in a department designed for 40). There are clear risks of future deaths for patients waiting for an ambulance as well as to patients whose diagnosis and treatment is delayed due to limited intervention being available in the back of an ambulance.","On the 30th May 2022 an inquest was opened into the death of Kyriacos Athanais.

That whilst the University Hospitals of Leicester(UHL) have taken adequate and acceptable steps following this incident to prevent this occurrence ever happening again.

Immediately post-operatively he was admitted to the adult Intensive Care Unit. During mobilisation of Mr Kew on the 22 July there was an inadvertent omission to secure one of the central venous catheter lines with a bung.

His medical cause of death was: 
1a) asphyxia
1b) inhalation of inert gas","During the course of the inquest, the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion, there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances, it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
1. The ELFT serious incident (SI) review report identified that, although Mr Largin was discharged to the Woodberry Wetlands neighbourhood rehabilitation team from the crisis (i.e. home treatment) team on 25 January 2022, the neighbourhood team did not allocate him to a team member until 3 February.
2. The report also identified that, despite receiving an email from the Homerton University Hospital community rehabilitation team on 2 February, saying that Mr Largin had been seen on 1 February and was still very depressed, the crisis team failed to reassess him or to re-open his case to the crisis team, but instead referred the community team to the neighbourhood team.
3. However, the SI report did not identify that the crisis team member who made the decision on 2 February simply to advise that Mr Largin should be dealt with by the neighbourhood team failed to record any reasons for her decision.
4. The SI reviewer giving evidence in court said that the SI reviewing team had not even spoken to that crisis team member as part of their investigation, let alone fed back to her.
5.      He said they did not at the time realise that she still worked for ELFT, though he accepted that it would have been an extremely straight forward matter to find out. The crisis team member's manager gave evidence that she thought the relevant decision maker had left the team before Mr Largin's death, so between 3 and 6 February 2022. When I invited that manager to make a call while the inquest was ongoing to check, she later told me that the team member had not left the crisis team until 29 April 2022.
6. It is believed, I was told, that there was a hot de-brief after Mr Largin's death. However, no notes were made of that and no entry was made on Mr Largin's medical record.
7.Thus, nobody from ELFT found out what the decision maker's thinking had been, or what misconceptions she might have had that other staff members might share. The former crisis team member who made the decision still works for ELFT. As far as I could ascertain, her decision making concerning Mr Largin has never been discussed with her by ELFT managers.
8.The SI review also did not identify that members of the crisis team and the neighbourhood team did not share an understanding of how quickly the neighbourhood team aims to make contact with patients, to assist in their decision making about the correct pathway for a patient. In fact, a member of the neighbourhood team itself gave evidence about the response times that, I was told later, was not correct.
9. Finally, the operations lead for the neighbourhood team had great difficulty in giving me clear evidence about whether his team would or could refer a patient back to the crisis team if they felt the circumstances warranted. He demonstrated a lack of clarity on the point that I found very concerning.","On 10 February 2022, one of my assistant coroners, Jonathan Stevens, commenced an investigation into the death of Andrew Mark Largin, aged 60 years. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest last Friday, 20 January 2023.  

I made a determination at inquest that Andrew Largin died by suicide. His mental health had been identified as deteriorating by a community rehabilitation team on 1 February 2022. That team notified the home treatment team who had discharged him from their care on 25 January 2023. However, the home treatment team failed to reassess him.","In my opinion, action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe that you have the power to take such action.","You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 27 March 2023.

He died on the 11th April 2021 from 1a Acute pancreatitis and liver necrosis resulting from 1b Gallstone disease (ERCP 8th April 2021). Had he been effectively monitored and subject to senior surgical supervision during the 9th April 2021 it is more likely than not that he would have survived.,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)  

An FY1 doctor was effectively left to her own devices to manage Mr Allen, despite her being only 8 months or so in a post qualification position. In my mind this was a wholly unacceptable lapse on the part of her senior clinicians. She was, despite her efforts, out of her depth. This is not a criticism of the FY1 doctor, simply a reflection that she had only a few months junior surgical experience at that time.  

All clinicians,[REDACTED] gave evidence that they were aware of the MKUH Sepsis protocol. However, none of them was able to describe it fully - the nearest being the most junior of the team, [REDACTED]. 

As a result there was a failure to initiate the sepsis protocol effectively.

There was no effective senior involvement in the care of Mr Allen from the end of the 0800 am ward round to his deterioration at around 1800 or so.

There was a failure to effectively or consistently monitor Mr Allen between 1059 am and his deterioration around 1800.

Even at that point despite, in my mind, a critical emergency, there was a further delay of one hour before the ITU team were called.

Overall, I find that the surgical team in charge of Mr Allen had no effective knowledge of the Sepsis protocol, they failed to monitor him effectively or consistently despite clear signs of deterioration, they failed to provide adequate support and supervision to [REDACTED] and they failed to institute an effective senior review at any point on the 9th April 2021 until critical deterioration by which time his chances of death due to his rapid deterioration and multi-organ failure were 80 to 100%.","On 03 November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Michael ALLEN aged 56. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 02 November 2022. 

The conclusion of the inquest was that:  

Mr Michael Allen died on the 11th April 2021 at the Milton Keynes University Hospital. He was admitted on the 3rd April 2021 with gallstone pancreatitis. Subsequent to ERCP removal of the obstructing gallstone there were missed opportunities on the 9th April 2021 to recognise that he was developing sepsis and also then to manage it effectively.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 5th April, 2023.

Ms Ayuk had been treated in the community and in hospital to manage her symptoms.

In October 2021 Ms Ayuk suffered a relapse of psychosis and was admitted under S.2 of the Mental Health Act to a mental health ward for treatment. After a period of stabilisation Mrs Ayuk was discharged home but returned shortly thereafter when symptoms returned in January 2022. At the time of her death Ms Ayuk had yet to be successfully titrated back on to Clozapine and consequently, was experiencing symptoms of her illness.

On 18th March 2022 Ms Ayuk was observed by staff to remain in her bedroom all day. Sophia sat, fully clothed and motionless on a chair for most of the day. Sophia would not respond to verbal prompts and declined food and drink.

At 20.45.49 Ms Ayuk was seen to emerge from her bedroom and walk down a corridor to the main area of the ward. Moments later Sophia fell to the floor and a patient alerted staff.

Staff made an emergency call for the rapid response team and went to Sophia' assistance. Ms Ayuk was breathing and conscious at that time. Sophia began to deteriorate and 999 was called at 21.04.

Paramedics responded promptly and on arrival found Sophia unresponsive but breathing. No pulse could be found and CPR was commenced. Resuscitation continued for 90 minutes until Sophia was declared deceased.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1. At no time during the two periods of Ms Ayuk's inpatient care was she assessed for venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk in contravention of trust policy.
2.Instructions given to monitor and record Ms Ayuk's food and fluid intake were not adequately followed.","On 19th March 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sophia Ayuk age 34 years. The investigation concluded at the end of an Article Two compliant inquest held on 18th and 19th January 2023. I arrived at a narrative conclusion.  

""Sophia Abunaw Ayuk died in hospital on 18th March 2023 as the result of a pulmonary embolism. A deep vein thrombosis had developed in her left calf due to Sophia sitting motionless in her room on the day of her death. Sophia's behaviour on 18th March 2022 was due to her mental illness. Ms Ayuk had not taken any food or drink for at least two days prior to her death.

Dehydration may have contributed to the development of Ms Ayuk's thrombosis.""

She used non-invasive ventilation (NIV) at home and brought her machine into RCHT with her when admitted.

Her presenting complaint was a painful knee, and the initial differential diagnoses were gout, septic arthritis or a flare of osteo arthritis. Her need for NIV was recognised but following her admission to MAU at 22:20 on 17/10/22, there was a lack of clarity about if and where NIV could be undertaken. As respiratory consultants do not provide an on- call service, it appears to have been decided to leave the issue until the following day when the evidence suggested the matter was simply forgotten.

Although presenting with a respiratory element to her condition, her admission was not brought to the attention of respiratory clinicians. On 21/10/21, a respiratory nurse became aware of her presence and took bloods that revealed a mixed respiratory and metabolic acidosis that had caused an AKI. Despite treatment, Ms Banfield deteriorated and died.

It was accepted in evidence that this was an avoidable death. The structured judgment review conducted found a poor level of care.

There was discussion about the cause for the AKI. While the failure to provide NIV was accepted, it was felt in evidence that the more likely significant driver was a failure to provide adequate fluid and food. Charts to evidence this were not completed.[REDACTED], accepted this had been a problem in MAU for years where there is a rapid turnover of patients and a lack of continuity in medical and nursing care.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows.
-A lack of clarity about if and when NIV can be offered to admitted patients.
-A patient admitted into RCHT with a respiratory element to her underlying condition was not brought to the attention of the respiratory team. The presenting complaint was not of a respiratory nature and so the challenge appears to be to identify those patients with multiple co-morbidities, one of which has a respiratory component, particularly where the patient is not on a respiratory ward.
-A failure to recognise a deterioration in the presentation of a patient which could have triggered a request for repeat bloods and revealed the worsening acidosis before an AKI developed. 

There appear at least two elements to this:
i) the use of food and fluid charts to make sure a patient is not becoming dehydrated and is having adequate calorific intake;
ii) for patients who stay on AMU longer than usual, ensuring there is some continuity in medical or nursing care, so a deterioration in presentation can be recognised promptly. Would there be value, for example, in requiring a patient who is on AMU for longer than say, 48 hours, to become the responsibility of a single, named consultant who will be responsible for regular review starting at the 48 hour mark?","On 25/1/23, I concluded an inquest into the death of Felice Eileen Grace Banfield who died in RCHT on 22/10/21.

The medical cause of death was recorded as:
1a) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Sarcoidosis

He had been living at home with a care package of support that included live in carers, up until his admission to hospital he had been dealt with by his local GP practice. He was admitted to Royal Bournemouth Hospital, on the 21st January 2021, suffering from Covid and pneumonia, he was successfully treated.

On the 8th March 2021 he was discharged from hospital, he was not able to return home and went to reside in a care home. Whilst resident there he was dealt with by a different GP practice. He was prescribed medication.

Dorset Council Adult Social Care were responsible for him and had drawn up a Care Plan. Derek Larkin wished to return to his home address and made this known to Adult Social Care in a telephone conversation on the 19th April 2021. Dorset Council liaised with the previous care providers the occupational health team, through a brokerage system they located a different care provider and made arrangements for Derek Larkin to return home on the 20th May 2021. Evidence from healthcare professionals at the inquest confirmed that Derek Larkin had capacity. On the 2nd June 2021 Derek Larkin was found deceased at home by a carer. A post mortem examination demonstrated that he had overdosed on his prescription morphine.

From the evidence at the inquest, it is clear that Dorset Council Adult Social Care would have benefited from having knowledge of the medications that had been prescribed. It is clear that family members raised concerns with
Adult Social Care about Derek Larkin's access to medication. In addition Adult Social Care would have benefited from any further information from the current GP practice together with his regular GP practice to enable them to consider what might be included within his care plan to include where the medication might be stored and whether it was to be administered by care staff or whether Derek Larkin was self-administering his medication.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
There is no evidence that the Dorset Council Adult Social Care computer system Mosaic can communicate with the NHS SystemOne. The Adult Social Care team would benefit from having information about the medication being prescribed to a patient, with the patient's consent, and when that medication was last reviewed. Dorset Council Adult Social Care would benefit from information held by a current or former GP practice as to a patient's medication and how to manage any particular concerns raised by health care professionals or family where a patient is able to independently manage his medication.","On the 31st August 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Derek Larkin, born on the 10th January 1964.

After failing to respond to antibiotics, she was seen at home by [REDACTED] her GP on 29/03/22. [REDACTED] considered that Mrs Jones needed to be admitted immediately to hospital. 

Mrs Jones had low oxygen levels and was drowsy and [REDACTED]requested that an ambulance attends within 2 to 3 hours. Following discussion with the ambulance service they informed[REDACTED]that there was a 2- 4 hour wait but that they would attempt to send an ambulance quicker.  

Unfortunately, the pressure on the ambulance service and a failure to identify an earlier available resource meant that paramedics did not attend until 20:28, over 9 hours later.

On arrival, paramedics confirmed that Mrs Jones had died and could not be revived.

On hearing the evidence, I determined that a failure to send an ambulance within a timescale required by the severity of Mrs Jones's illness, contributed to her death.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -
1.The ongoing pressures faced by the ambulance service are clearly multifactorial. However, a failure to provide a resource within a reasonable timeframe has been a constant and ongoing feature of inquests within Gwent, where a patient has died at home or shortly after admission to hospital. Despite repeated reassurances over the past 12 months about remedial action being undertaken, the evidence before me at this inquest suggests there has been no appreciable improvement in the response times for Amber 1 category patients.

2.The Amber 1 category includes all life-threatening conditions except those in the Red category where the person appears to be in the throes of dying. I was informed that all the patients in the Amber 1 category are allocated an ambulance
/ clinical resource chronologically, without further consideration of clinical need.

3. I was informed at the inquest that on occasion a clinician within WAST will intervene to undertake a further assessment to determine whether the response should be expedited. However, this appeared to be an ad hoc arrangement not underpinned by local policy or guidelines.

4.The evidence suggested that a patient who was choking, had difficulty breathing and was drowsy would still be assessed, under the current algorithm adopted by WAST, as meeting the requirement for an Amber 1 response.",,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.

1.The steps being undertaken on a national and local level to address the delays in ambulance response times, particularly within the Amber 1 category.
2.Whether consideration can be given to undertaking a more detailed clinical assessment of the patients within Amber 1 to ensure those in the greatest need for clinical intervention are given priority.
3.The process for reassessment of the patient's clinical condition during the time they are waiting for an ambulance.
4.Confirm whether the national algorithm adopted by WAST is fit for purpose and that there is provision to identify life-threatening scenarios, where a

They outlined that approximately 15 metres from where Mr Easdale crossed the road, there was a traffic island (or pedestrian refuge) with a bollard and streetlamp in place. The bollard on the island is made out of opaque white plastic and is designed to be illuminated from within. The time of the collision was around 5pm on a December afternoon meaning that this stretch of road was in deep darkness.

When the collision occurred on the 5th November 2021, neither the illuminated bollard nor the streetlamp were in working order and were therefore unlit. Both officers from the collision unit gave evidence that this situation presented a danger to road users and pedestrians.

A Traffic Management Officer has brought this situation to the attention of Hertfordshire County Council, Highways England (now National Highways) and National Power Networks (now UK Power Networks).

Despite this, I heard evidence at the inquest that both the bollard and the streetlamp have still not been repaired and remain unlit even in the hours of darkness.

I was not able to say on the balance of probabilities that the lack of lighting on the pedestrian island
contributed to Mr Easdale's death as he was not using the crossing itself when he was struck. He crossed nearby, however, and it is possible that had there been illumination at that island the driver of the car would have seen him earlier and potentially avoided the collision.

I am satisfied that the lack of working lights at this location on the B197 Digswell Hill poses a danger to road users and pedestrians. The location of the island is near to the Red Lion Public House and may be used by people going to and from the pub.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) That the lack of working lights on the pedestrian refuge on the B197 Digswell Hill (near the Red Lion Public House) poses a danger to road users and pedestrians. Specifically that neither the illuminated bollard nor the streetlamp are in working order.","On the 12th December 2021 Steven Easdale died at Addenbrookes Hospital from injuries sustained in a road traffic collision. His death was reported to the Coroner and an investigation commenced. 

A post- mortem examination performed by Dr Martin Goddard on 21st December 2021 provided the following cause of death: 
1a Purulent Bronchitis and Bronchopneumonia 
1b Multiple Traumatic Injuries 

An inquest was opened on 9th March 2022 and the investigation concluded at the end of that inquest on the 8th February 2023, which found: 

Circumstances: 
On the 5th November 2021 Steven Easdale was struck by a car whilst crossing the B197 Digswell Hill. He sustained multiple injuries and was taken by ambulance to Addenbrookes Hospital. Despite treatment, Mr Easdale died on the 12th December 2021. There was a central pedestrian island near to where Mr Easdale crossed the road but he did not use it. It was dark at the time Mr Easdale crossed, he was wearing dark clothing and the driver did not have time to react to his presence in the road and avoid the collision. The central pedestrian island near to where Mr Easdale crossed the road should have been illuminated. It was not in working order, however, and was therefore unlit. A nearby streetlamp was also not working and was unlit. Had the pedestrian island and streetlamp been illuminated it may have helped the driver to see Mr Easdale earlier and avoid the collision.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
The Inquest heard evidence of significant waits in Accident and Emergency (A&E) to be seen due to the pressure on the department. The Inquest heard that the position had not improved since his death and there were regular waits in excess of 11 hours in A&E due to demand on services which impacted on patients care and treatment. The position was not unique to the particular Trust but was replicated in Trusts across Greater Manchester.

The Inquest was told that prolonged waits in A&E were also due to a lack of beds with the hospital. In Mr Stanley's case direct entry to a ward would have been in his best interests. However lack of capacity meant that he had to be advised to go to A&E and wait for a bed.","On 24th May 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Benjamin Paul Stanley.

David first spoke to his GP on the phone about some swollen lumps on his neck on 14 October 2020. He was advised that he should have blood tests and these were booked for 2 November 2020. 
 
2. On 23 October 2020 he further sought advice from the GP because he had pain in his ear and was complaining of an ear infection. At this telephone appointment there was an assessment for mastoiditis and otitis externa was diagnosed. Antibiotic ear drops were prescribed. 

3. He was then spoken to on the phone again on 28 October 2020 because he felt that he had blood in his urine. He was advised to deliver a urine sample to the Practice which he did and when tested contained blood and white cells resulting in further antibiotics being prescribed. The view of the GP expert was that this was unlikely to be a UTI however there would be no basis on which a GP would link these symptoms to mastoiditis and therefore the treatment was not unreasonable on this occasion.

4. From the evidence [REDACTED], ENT consultant it is more likely than not that at some point in the days after this appointment, David began to develop the abscess that would ultimately prove fatal.

5.On 2 November 2020 David had a telephone consultation with an ANP at his practice. He had continued fever, pain behind his eye and sinus pain. He had had a negative covid-19 swab in the week prior to this appointment but nevertheless his blood tests were cancelled and he was advised not to visit the surgery but to take a further Covid-19 swab and await the results. This clearly unsettled David who was concerned to get his blood tests completed and the ANP gave reassurance that as soon as he had a negative covid-19 swab she would book him in for his blood tests and see him urgently in practice.

6.As the 2 November 2020 progressed David became increasingly unwell. This resulted in David's partner contacting NHS 111. She explained his symptoms and was advised that a clinician would call back within 6 hours. Unfortunately David then vomited and so his partner called NHS 111 again and was given the same advice. When a clinician did call David's partner was advised not to wake him if he was sleeping and to keep up to date with the codeine pain relief. About an hour later David began to be disorientated and his partner made a final call to NHS 111 resulting in an ambulance being called.

7. David was placed on the dental pathway for NHS 111 which meant that he missed the opportunity to be asked questions which may have identified mastoiditis. However this pathway at the time was not unreasonable for him on the basis of his symptoms.

8. David was taken to St James' Hospital initially. He was triaged quickly and a working diagnosis of either meningitis or encephalitis was made. Both of these conditions would be treated at St James'. He required a CT scan which was undertaken just over 2 hours after it was booked. This was within the context of an ED suffering significant pressures.

9.As soon as the CT scan was undertaken it was apparent how unwell David was and urgent steps were taken to transfer him to the LGI for neurosurgery.

10. Unfortunately whilst David was in the resuscitation part of ED he deteriorated very significantly and suffered a fall resulting in head lacerations. This fall did not contribute to his death but nevertheless represented an acute deterioration in his condition with his GCS going from 10 to 3 and requiring immediate ventilation.

11. David survived to the LGI and underwent surgery to insert an external ventricular drain. This appeared to be a successful procedure at first and David responded however he continued to deteriorate over the course of the 3 and 4thof November 2020 and clinicians determined that his condition was unsurvivable.

12.David died at the LGI on 4 November 2020.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
I heard evidence that David's father made a complaint to NHSE about the primary care service, namely the GP Practice, that David had had contact with. 

This resulted in a clinical review of that complaint by Dr D'Souza which was initially highly critical of the 4 occasions of care which David had at his GP Practice (listed above)

It appears that this complaint was handled without a clinical rationale from the GP Practice being provided which resulted in [REDACTED] reviewing his opinion once that information was provided in the anticipation of inquest proceedings. I heard evidence from the GP Practice that they were not made aware of the concerns raised by [REDACTED] until the inquest process had disclosed these concerns.

I am unclear how the primary care complaints team ensure that the details from their clinical reviews are fully informed taking account of information provided from complainants and those involved in the clinical management of a patient and how that information is then shared back to the practice to ensure appropriate learning can be undertaken. I am also not clear of the process of cascading this information to the primary care network in general where that is appropriate to raise awareness of an issue or condition for example.","On 13 November 2020 an investigation commenced into the death of David John Nash born on 26 August 1994. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 20 January 2023. 

The conclusion of the inquest was:  
David died on 4 November 2020 at Leeds General Infirmary as a result of a brain-stem infarction, arising from a cerebella abscess caused by mastoiditis. On 2 November 2020 there was a missed opportunity to direct David to seek face-to-face care during his GP appointment that morning. Had he been directed to seek face-to-face or urgent care by the GP Practice it is more likely than not that he would have undergone neurosurgery approximately 10 hours earlier than he actually did; which at that time it is more likely than not would have been successful. 

The medical cause of death was: 
1a: Brain-stem infarction 
1b: Cerebellar abscess 
1c: Mastoiditis",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by Tuesday 28th March 2023.

(2) Between 2015 and 2018 she was repeatedly admitted to the Priory hospital in Hayes but following each discharge her weight fell rapidly and she required readmission. She was discharged for a final time in October 2018 and subsequently admitted to the Bethlem hospital a couple of weeks later in the November. She was a resident of Kent and throughout her care the local Eating Disorder service were involved in her care (Kent and Medway Eating Disorder service managed by North East London Foundation Trust.)

(3) By May 2019 it had become clear to the treating clinicians that Hayley had not gained weight and was managing to falsify her weight. Her illness was pervasive and her metabolism severely affected with a seizure in July 2019 likely as a consequence of hypoglycaemia and her liver function deteriorated showing signs of raised transaminases as a consequence of her malnutrition. She was subject to regular blood tests and her leave was restricted when her results were abnormal leading to some improvements. She was referred for a Hepatology opinion and investigations at Kings.

(4) As she was unlikely to be able to cope in the community steps were taken to find a suitable rehabilitation placement, the nearest being Ipswich some considerable distance away from her family and any support network she had. There were no local units where Hayley could have been treated which may have led to improved communication and more involvement and support from her family. We heard evidence from Professor Consultant Psychiatrist from the Bethlem hospital and Dr. an independent Consultant Psychiatrist that her final placement was one of only two units in the country offering rehabilitation treatment for those suffering from Anorexia Nervosa.

(5)As she had been so resistant to treatment she was discharged with a Community Treatment Order (CTO) in place. On 22 December 2019 she travelled back to Kent to spend Christmas with her family.

(6)On 23rd December 2019 she had not eaten, became confused and unwell, and an ambulance was called. The correct emergency treatment was provided but Hayley responded quickly and regained consciousness and refused further treatment or admission to hospital. On 24th December she became unwell again and this time was taken to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital where she again refused treatment and discharged herself against medical advice. The responsible medical officer from the Kent Eating disorder team gave evidence that had the team known of either of these episodes they would have taken steps to admit her and treat her.

(7) On Christmas Day 2019 she collapsed for a final time and this time, had an out of hospital cardiac arrest, and was admitted to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital and transferred to Intensive care where she was diagnosed as suffering from hypoxic brain damage as a result of her cardiac arrest due to severe hypoglycaemia as a consequence of her Anorexia Nervosa. She died on 29thDecember 2019 at the age of twenty-seven.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) Evidence given at the inquest revealed that there were seven different organisations involved in Hayley's care all of whom had different systems for recording their clinical notes:
I. South London and the Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLAM)
II. North East London NHS Foundation Trust (NELFT locally known as the Kent and Medway Eating Disorders Team)
III. The White House
IV. Kings College NHS Foundation Trust (Kings)
V. General Practitioner (GP)
VI. East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust (EKHT for Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother)
VII. South East Coast Ambulance Service

(2) The evidence given at the inquest revealed that each of the organisations were reliant on being copied into correspondence or on specific information being shared by others. The White House were not sent copies of clinical correspondence and at the time did not have access to GP records although since Hayley's death do now have access to GP records. The mental health team at NELFT were responsible for managing Hayley's CTO despite the fact that she was placed out of their geographical area but were not aware she had been seen by either the ambulance service or by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital.

(3) The evidence at the inquest revealed that communication between those involved in her short life was inadequate and, as each ran separate clinical records systems, they could not access crucial information which could have made a difference ultimately meaning Hayley may not have died when she did. It is highly likely that had the paramedic at South East Coast Ambulance Trust who attended Hayley on 23rd December or the emergency department nurse who saw her at Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother hospital on 24th December 2019 been aware that Hayley was on a CTO they or her treating mental health team would have been able to take steps which would have saved her life.

(4) Evidence was given at the inquest that locally some steps have been taken to try to share key data between acute hospitals but there have been significant hurdles which have impeded the process namely, the different information technology systems used, licensing issues for the software, Data Protection requirements, confidentiality and consent issues as well as training and funding.

(5) Hayley died following an out of hospital cardiac arrest on Christmas day 2019. If information been shared between different health care organisations particularly crucial information about Hayley's CTO it is highly likely she would still be alive today.","On the 5th February 2020 an inquest was opened into the death of Hayley Smith.

The cause of death was: 
1a. Cerebral Oedema 
1b. Acute and Subdural Haematoma (Operated) 
1c. Head and Chest Injuries

The jury found that: Mr Basten died on 28th February 2016 at St George's Hospital, Tooting while in care for head and chest injuries sustained on 25th February 2016. These injuries were sustained during a fall which took place while working at a height on a construction site in Chaldon. Following the incident, Mr Basten was airlifted to St George's Hospital, where he was diagnosed with an acute subdural haematoma. Mr Basten was operated on for the acute subdural haematoma but following the operation he suffered a cerebral oedema to which he succumbed. Mr Basten had been engaged as a carpenter to work on the roof and started work before the end of January 2016. On the morning of 25th February 2016 Mr Basten was working on the first-floor dormer at the rear of the property at a height of at least 2.5m. This first-floor area was comprised of open wooden joists and an RSJ suspended at least 2.5m above concrete and wooden board. There was no safe internal access to the first floor. This area did not have edge protection and was not completely boarded out. On the day in question, this area was access via an unsecured scaffold ladder. There is no material evidence of planning for the first-floor timberwork regarding health and safety. There was no site supervisor at the time of the incident.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  
The concerns relates to the fact that there is a lack of compulsory provision for sprinklers or other fire safety measures to protect those who live at home (outside of care homes) but are being provided with extra care facilities or those in retirement type provision.  Due to there being an ageing population and a lack of care home spaces there is a growing number of people (who would normally be residing in care homes) who are now having to buy care packages to be delivered either in their own homes or other residential type of facilitates. The providers of such accommodation are not subject to any fire safety provisions. People who find themselves in this type of facility do suffer declining health and mobility as time goes on. They are at a particular risk should a fire occur. They are more at risk than those in care homes as there is 24/7 staffing and trained individuals who are well versed in responding to a fire situation and evacuating the residents from the affected areas of the premises.

In an extra care facility it is highly probable that should a fire start that the occupant would be unable to leave the room of fire origin/ flat of origin through ill health/ poor mobility, and who would be overcome by the toxic products of combustion prior to the Fire and Rescue service being alerted. This is exactly what happened in Mr Harfield's case.

We heard at this Inquest that whilst a sprinkler controlled fire would still produce smoke it would be of a lower level, and there is evidence that on the majority of occasions it does not just restrict the fires growth, but actually extinguishes it.

It is understood that there is currently a Government consultation being undertaken on the subject of Sprinklers in Care homes but the scope of this consultation does not cover the specific risk to those in extra care facilities. This is a missed opportunity.

At 15.15 hours on the 31st July 2020 Jason Anthony Williams was found unresponsive in his cell, cell 42, Gwent wing, HMP Guys Marsh, Shaftesbury, by prison officers carrying out accommodation fabric check. His death was confirmed a short time later by attending paramedics. Prior to his death he had used psychoactive substances. 

On 30th July 2020 prison staff on the wing opened a welfare log following suspicion that Jason was under the influence of illicit substances, however the process set out in the Illicit Substances Welfare Document was not fully followed. It cannot be established that this had any causative or contributory bearing on Jason's death the following day.

On 31st July 2020 Jason's cell door was unlocked by prison staff at 14.14 hours however a welfare check was not conducted upon unlock. It cannot be established that this had any causative or contributory bearing on Jason's death.

i JASON'S HISTORY OF MISUSE OF DRUGS

Jason's history of misuse of drugs probably caused or contributed more than minimally to his death. Jason had a habitual drug habit that was documented on assessment on entering HMP Guys Marsh and throughout his custodial sentence.

ii JASON'S VULNERABILITY

We are satisfied that Jason's vulnerability possibly contributed to his death more than minimally. Jason's drug dependency in Prison contributed to his vulnerability due to his apparent willingness to take illicit substances.

iii THE DRUG PREVENTION STRATEGIES IN THE PRISON IN JULY 2020

The restrictions imposed in July 2020 due to Covid, impacted the execution of the drug prevention strategy. This possibly contributed more than minimally to Jason's death.
iv. THE MEASURES TAKEN BY THE PRISON FOLLOWING THE SUSPECTED THROWOVER ON 25TH JULY 2020
v THE STEPS TAKEN BY THE PRISON, AND/OR ISMS TO SAFEGUARD JASON FOLLOWING THE SUSPECTED THROWOVER ON 25TH JULY 2020 AND ONCE HE WAS FOUND TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF PS ON 30TH JULY 2020

No specific instruction was given to staff relating to Jason following the suspected throwover of illicit items and the increase of psychoactive substance incidents around this time. Nor were there any additional briefings to prison officers or notices distributed to prisoners. This possibly contributed more than minimally to Jason's death.

This could be constituted as a safeguarding failure towards Jason from the steps taken by the Prison.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. During the Inquest evidence was heard that:
i.There was a differing opinion between professionals including those from the healthcare, Integrated Substance Misuse Service (ISMS) and prison staff as to whether Jason was vulnerable. Evidence was given that there is no national guidance either from HMPPS or the NHS on how to care for vulnerable prisoners in custody. It was confirmed that there is reference in certain documents such as PSI 64/2011 to vulnerability but no specific dedicated guidance on vulnerability. There is no definition of vulnerability, what to look out for regarding vulnerability, who may be deemed to be vulnerable or how to care for a vulnerable prisoner. Those serving sentences relating to sexual offending are often referred to as vulnerable prisoners, but there are other reasons for vulnerability and there is no targeted guidance to assist those working within the prison estate to care for these individuals. For example, evidence was given that at HMP Guys Marsh they are in the process of creating guidance for caring for those at risk of self-neglect as there is no national guidance on this issue.

ii.Evidence was heard that the keyworker programme is a national programme for application in all prisons. Keyworker sessions are an essential part of a prisoner's journey through their sentence and prison life. Evidence was given that there has been limited success nationally since it's roll out which was believed to be in 2016/2017 and one of the reasons for this is resourcing. Evidence was given that at HMP Guys Marsh they struggle to deliver the keyworker programme and that it has not been delivered at the desired level for a long time. I have concerns therefore that the current system in place is not fit for purpose.

iii. There is national guidance in PSI 23/2014, which relates to the Prison NOMIS system, around the recording case notes on the system. At paragraph 4.9 it states:

All staff who have contact with an offender and who have access to Prison-NOMIS must update case notes on a regular basis.

In the NOMIS case notes for Jason there did not appear to be regular entries from Prison staff. For example, between the entry on the 19th March 2020 and 7th June 2020 there was no record by prison staff who had contact with Jason on the wing. Whilst it is noted this was when the Covid 19 pandemic began, this was a time when there should have been increased monitoring and recording due to the fact activities were suspended and there was less general contact with prisoners from others outside the wing.

Information was provided that Prison staff have access to PSI 23/2014, they are provided with the Prison Officers' Guide produced by HMPPS and they are provided with training on record keeping at the Prison Officer Entry Level Training (POELT) training. There is no refresher training at HMP Guys Marsh on
record keeping, or the importance of it other than to cover information sharing.

Evidence was given as to the importance of triangulation of communication and care between the prison, healthcare and ISMS staff. Healthcare and ISMS have access to the NOMIS records as well as the prion staff and this is therefore the key record for information sharing about a prisoner, their risks and vulnerabilities.

iv. Governor notices can be sent to prison staff and prisoners to advise them of any matters, including when there are warnings to be given to prisoners. In the past at HMP Guys Marsh, Governor notices have been sent out when there has been a spike in psychoactive substance incidents. There was no Governor notice sent out between the 25th July 2020, when there was a suspected throw over of illicit items into the prison, and the 3rd August 2020. Over this period of 9 days there were 106 recorded psychoactive substance attacks which was described in evidence as an incredibly high number. Evidence was given that these notices are issued at the discretion of the Governor.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:
i.There is a lack of specific and dedicated national guidance to prison and healthcare staff on how to define and care for vulnerable prisoners. I would request that consideration is given to producing national guidance on this, to also include guidance on addressing self-neglect.

ii. The current keyworker programme is not working as planned at HMP Guys Marsh and there was reference to this also being reflected nationally. I would request that consideration is given to a review being undertaken of the keyworker programme within the whole prison estate, and also specifically at HMP Guys Marsh.

iii.The quantity and quality of record keeping by prison staff at HMP Guys Marsh on NOMIS. I request that consideration is given to providing refresher training to prison staff on record keeping to cover the importance of records and their contents, and the required regularity of recording.

iv. A Governor notice was not issued in the time leading up to Jason's death to prisoners or staff around the concerns regarding access to, and the impact of using, psychoactive substances. I request that consideration is given to a review being undertaken by HMP Guys Marsh as to when such notices should be issued, particularly in relation to increased risks to prisoners around drug use.","On the 13th August 2020 an investigation was commenced into the death of Jason Anthony Williams, born on the 7th January 1981.

At about 09:15rs on Monday 31st May 2021 officers have been made aware of a concern for the wellbeing of PS DUIGNAN and they have been asked to make a search of the airport policing unit offices located at Percival Way Luton.

Officers have conducted the search and have found PS DUIGNAN deceased on the floor of the gym which is located on the ground floor and next-door to the armoury, also on the ground beside him was a police side arm hand gun and two bullets.

First aid has commenced and an ambulance has been called, paramedics have attended and continued treatment but unfortunately, he was declared deceased at 09:45hrs by paramedic [REDACTED].

It should be noted the PS DUIGNAN was arrested on Saturday 29th May 2021 for the offence of drink driving and taken to Milton Keynes police station where the drink drive procedure was carried out,","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
Sean Duignan was arrested on the 29th May 2021 and taken to Milton Keynes Police Station where he was detained and released under investigation the next day, Sunday 30th. That seems to have been a likely trigger for Sean to take his own life.
The next day he was on leave and went to the Luton Airport Police base where the Southern Armoury was located. He was the Armed Response base sergeant.
Sean entered the equipment room, where the manual override keys to the armoury were located in a locked box secured by a PIN. Officer [REDACTED] who were present in the equipment room said Sean appeared startled to find them there. He remained cheerful and engaged in cheeky banter[REDACTED] was of the view that Sean entered so that he could access the armoury key.
Sean, discovering his access to the override key was blocked asked one of the officers to second him into the armoury. By chance, it was[REDACTED] who agreed and went with Sean to the armoury. She had been given single access by error systems failure some time previously. Sean applied his armoury and entered his PIN. It failed. [REDACTED] and used her card and PIN. Because she was allowed - incorrectly - single access, the door opened and she let Sean in where he retrieved a handgun and ammunition. Had [REDACTED] any other officer at base known that Sean's access had been restricted she would not, I am
certain, have allowed him entry.

There was a serious failure by senior management to effectively and safely manage the South Base Armoury. All the base officers who gave evidence before me told me the armoury system, which they referred to as Chronicle, repeatedly and randomly failed. These multiple failures were, according to [REDACTED] not communicated effectively to her. She agreed that she did not herself make any further detailed enquiry instead relying on her Operational Inspector to manage the issue and/or to feed back as appropriate.
The computerised system controlling the access to the armoury at South Base included a number of different parts including the server, the software, the Chronicle system itself, the card readers etc. The system as a whole repeatedly failed. There was no effective ongoing monitoring of the system. CI Rowley Smith agreed that the
system did not work properly and the monitoring system did not work properly. As part of a fail safe to ensure that officers who needed weapons could obtain them if the computerised system failed, an armoury override key was kept in a locked box, secured by a PIN, in the equipment room. All officers giving evidence before me agreed that the PIN number was common knowledge.

The fact that the PIN number was common knowledge meant potentially that any one of the officers working at the base had unfettered access to the armoury [REDACTED]. The fact that the access was not abused by the officers was due wholly to their trustworthiness and professionalism. On this occasion, Sean sought access to the armoury via the key but was thwarted by both PC being present in the equipment room. Unfettered access to the armoury meant that rogue officers (of whom luckily there were none) could potentially have had access to weapons for the purposes of criminality, suicide (as in Sean's case) or homicide.

Overall, I find the lax approach to safety and security in the South Base armoury by senior management, who were responsible, to be extraordinary.[REDACTED] agreed that the armoury was an unsafe environment.

In the interval between Sean's death and the Inquest some 18 months later, I was not reassured that effective action had been taken to secure the armoury. Immediately post Inquest some reassurance was provided but gaps remained.","On 10 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Sean Gerard DUIGNAN aged 44. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 14 November 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was that:

Sean Gerard Duignan was a well respected, well liked and universally helpful base sergeant at the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit (South Base). On the 29th May 2021 he was arrested following reports of a vehicle being driven erratically and dangerously. A Bedfordshire Police sergeant visited him at his home to conduct what was initially to be a welfare check. Sean was intoxicated with alcohol and was arrested and taken into custody on suspicion of drink or drug driving. He remained in custody until the following afternoon when he was released under investigations. Multiple and serial enquiries were made by members of the custody and health care staff at Milton Keynes Police Custody suite to determine his mental health and to keep him safe. Those checks were repeated on release. They were continued by the police federation representatives and his close friend [REDACTED]. All seemed well. The next day, a day off, Sean travelled to the Luton Airport Armed Policing Unit where the South Base armoury is located. The armoury security was lax and had been for a prolonged period. The computer system used for electronic access was repeatedly failing but seemingly no coherent approach was taken to remedy this. The back up master armoury key was kept in a PIN protected locked box, but the PIN number was universally known. Because of an error in the computerised system an officer was allocated single point access when she should not have been. She unwittingly let Sean, whose own access to the armoury had been restricted without his colleagues being informed, into the armoury. He took a hand gun and ammunition, entered the base gym and shot himself in the head.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 13, 2023.

Mrs Brind required increasing oxygen which was not escalated to the Ambulance Navigator at the hospital, no further physiological observations were undertaken and no ECG was undertaken. Mrs Brind was taken to the ward at 17.30 hours, when she became agitated and short of breath. Advanced life support was put into place but Mrs Brind's condition continued to deteriorate and she died at 17.52 hours.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.   

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1) Evidence was heard that there was a delay in Mrs Brind being transferred from the ambulance to the Emergency Department of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital as there was no space in the hospital
2) As delays are a reoccurring problem, checks are made by paramedics and Hospital clinicians on patients while they wait in ambulances for transfer into the hospital to assist in prioritising the need for transfer.
3) In the case of Mrs Brind, physiological observations were not undertaken regularly in accordance with East of England Ambulance Service Trust (EEAST) Guidance and when they were taken, her high NEWS2 score was not escalated to the Hospital Ambulance Navigator who assesses priority for beds in the hospital.
4) Further Mrs Brind was not assessed by a Senior Doctor from the Hospital within an hour, in accordance with Hospital protocol
5) I am satisfied that steps have been taken by both EEAST and the Hospital in respect of these matters and do not make a report in respect of either of these matters
6) Evidence was heard that there are regularly too many patients in the Emergency Department and so ambulances cannot safely transfer patients into the Emergency Department. The EEAST is working with the Hospital (along with other hospitals in the area) to find ways to deal with this problem and methods are in place to try to alleviate the consequences of these delays.
7) However, it was heard that this is a much wider and more complex problem, in that the Hospital is unable to discharge patients who are medically fit to be discharged and they remain occupying much needed beds. This in turn means patients cannot be moved from the Emergency Department into the hospital wards, and patients remain waiting in ambulances. This in turn causes delays in ambulances being returned to normal duty and being able to attend to emergencies in the community.
8) Evidence was heard that at the time of Mrs Brind's death, approximately 7 ambulances were waiting to transfer patients into the Emergency Department, Queen Elizabeth Hospital. At the time of the inquest, this had risen to 17 ambulances commonly waiting to transfer patients from the ambulance into the Emergency Department.
9) Further at the time of the inquest there were approximately 140 beds at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital occupied by patients who were medically fit to be discharged, but beds could not be found in the community.","On 07 June 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Lyn Mary BRIND aged 61.

He was diagnosed with myelodysplasia (chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia) on the 31st December 2019, following a bone marrow biopsy.
On the 19th August 2020 Glenn suffered a mechanical fall up some garden steps at his home. Due to only having one arm he wasn't able to fully break his fall, hitting his head on the garage side door and sustaining a graze on his head. He didn't lose consciousness. He elected not to seek medical attention on the day. The following day, 20th August 2020, he attended the Minor Injuries Unit (""MIU"") at Bridgwater Community Hospital where the underwent a full and thorough triage at 11.03 by a trainee emergency nurse practitioner who noted his diagnosis of leukaemia. This took place 4 minutes after his arrival.

He was then assessed by an emergency care practitioner (""ECP"") 20 minutes later who, again, conducted a full and comprehensive neurological assessment. The ECP contacted a Senior Doctor at Musgrove Park Hospital to discuss Glenn, given his diagnosis of Leukaemia. The consensus of medical opinion at the time was that in the absence of any clinical features and/or concerns within the neurological assessment, then Glenn was suitable to be discharged home with appropriate head injury advice.

At 18:27 on the 21st August 2020 Glenn attended the Emergency Department at Musgrove Park Hospital with a headache. This is the first time he had experienced that symptom since his fall two days previously. A CT scan was organised which revealed a major brain haemorrhage.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise a concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

NICE Guidance (Head Injury: assessment and early management published January 2014) states at para 1.4.12 that only patients who are on anticoagulant treatment should be offered/given a CT scan following a head injury with no other symptoms of concern (i.e. no loss of conscious, vomiting and no reduced CGS). It was clear from the evidence that there are other naturally occurring conditions, such as leukaemia, which can affect the ability of a patient's blood to clot and so it would place such patients in the same potential risk category as those on anticoagulants, yet it is clear that a distinction is made.
Consequently I am concerned that the guidance (that for the avoidance of doubt was followed during Glenn's treatment) is ambiguous for such patients in terms of triage and a treatment/investigatory path meaning that there may be missed opportunities to CT scan patients in the future.","On the 26th August 2020 the then-Senior Coroner, Mr Tony Williams, commenced an investigation into the death of Glenn Barton, aged 71. 

The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest, heard before me, on the 16th August 2022. The conclusion of the inquest was Accidental death, including medical cause of death being Ia) Traumatic subdural haematoma II) Myelodysplasia (Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukaemia)  
With a finding in box 3 that: 
On the 19th August 2020, Glen BARTON tripped on garden steps at his home address consequently falling and striking his head on the door of the garage. Glen had an existing diagnosis of myelodysplasia (chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia). This meant he had a low platelet count which is a form of blood clotting disorder.  

The day after this fall, on the 20th August 2020 Glen drove himself to the Minor Injuries Unit at Bridgwater hospital where he was triaged by a trainee emergency nurse practitioner and assessed by an emergency care practitioner in accordance with NICE guidelines. As part of this assessment there was a telephone discussion with a staff grade clinician at Musgrove Park Hospital. Glen was then discharged home with written and verbal head injury advice as at that time he did not present with any clinical features that would indicate a CT scan was required.
It was not appreciated at the time of triage nor assessment that a diagnosis of leukaemia may have increased Glen's risk of suffering a significant intracranial bleed following a relatively minor head trauma and the operative clinical guidance was ambiguous on whether a CT scan would be required.

On the 21st August 2022 Glen developed severe headaches and vomiting following his fall 2 days previously. He attended Musgrove Park Hospital Emergency Department where a CT scan was requested. This was not performed until 21:50 due to other patients presenting with a more urgent clinical need. There was no record of any neurological observations but nursing staff became concerned about his cognitive abilities. The CT scan revealed a catastrophic subdural haematoma which was unsurvivable. Glen was not a candidate for surgical intervention. He died on the Twenty-second of August 2020 as a result of the subdural haematoma sustained at the time of the original fall. There has been no evidence that an earlier scan would have changed the tragic outcome.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 18th October 2022.

He had been admitted to The Linden Centre on 19th October 2020 after experiencing a psychotic episode whilst staying with friends in Bristol. At 19:56 on 23rd October, Jayden was able to abscond from The Linden Centre after tailgating a member of staff Jayden ran from the building and travelled by foot towards Chelmsford Town Centre. At 21:45, Jayden was struck by a train and killed. There were a number of contributing factors that led to Jayden's absconsion, lack of capture and subsequent death:
1.Jayden had a history of illicit drug and alcohol use which contributed to his psychosis and led to intrusive thoughts, threats to self-harm and fear of being detained.
2. There was a family history of mental history which was not considered strongly enough.
3. There were a number of structural and environmental vulnerabilities that impacted staff and patient security and safety.
4. Inconsistencies with level of patient care, record keeping and communication.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust risk assessments missed key risk information that led to a reduction in observations levels on the ward.

(2) There is a lack of understanding at Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust level about the difference between:
a. a patient who has been granted section 17 leave under the Mental Health Act who does not return from a period of authorised leave, and
b. a patient who being subject to detention under the Mental Health Act, who has escaped from the confines of the ward and who has not been granted section 17 leave by the Responsible Clinician
and therefore, there is a concern as to how this information is then communicated to emergency services searching for the patient of the risks of self-harm.

(3) Miscommunication between:
a. Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust to emergency services
b. Essex Police to Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust
c. Essex Police to other emergency services

In seeking further information, how a risk managed within the confines of a secure mental health ward may change for an escaped patient and whether there is real and immediate risk of serious or fatal harm to self or others, rather than assumptions that language is being used in the same way by different services.

(4) Lack of an Essex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust senior single point of contact for communications with emergency services who would provide any further information or receive updates and how this could be managed across change of shifts.","On 17 November 2020 an investigation into the death of Jayden Andrew BOOROFF, aged 23 years. Jayden Andrew Booroff died on the 23 October 2020. The investigation concluded at the end of the 10-day inquest on 25 November 2022. 

The conclusion of the inquest was narrative, 
Jayden's use of illicit drugs and alcohol contributed heavily to his psychotic condition and if this had been addressed earlier, it may have made a difference to his health, wellbeing and treatment. More consideration should have been given to Jayden's relevant family history and more weight should have been given to this alongside the diagnosis that his psychosis was triggered by drug and alcohol use only. The layout of The Linden Centre in particular the areas around the main doors was not appropriate for ensuring the safety of its more vulnerable patients. Procedures around the use and allocation of Pinpoint alarms was inadequate. The Policy recording and reporting absconsions from The Linden Centre was not clear enough and led to a lack of awareness and a delay in addressing the flaws in the system. Responsibility for Jayden was not in line with policy and this contributed to a reduction in observation levels and inconsistencies in prescribed medications. Communication between all healthcare professionals involved in Jayden's treatment was unsatisfactory, with mistakes being made in updating key documents. Risk assessments were not updated accurately enough or in good time, and failed to capture important information, including historical and emerging information. Whilst there are lessons to be learnt following Jayden's absconsion from the Linden Centre, the response from the emergency services and [railway] were appropriate, and any alternative actions would not have altered the eventual outcome within the time that was available to them.

Following this admission Mr PENNICOTT was referred to see a Neurologist , as an urgent referral, as an outpatient. At the time he was suffering from Guillain Barre Syndrome. Despite his GP and family chasing up this appointment he was not offered an appointment until 19th August 2021. Sadly he suffered a cardiac arrest in the early hours of the very day that his appointment was due to take place.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  
During the course of the evidence the Hospital explained that long waiting times for neurology outpatient appointments was a persistent challenge for the Trust due to capacity issues within the neurology service.  

There had been a long-term vacancy, of three years, within the neurology service for a substantive neurology consultant at the hospital. The Inquest was told that there was a national shortage of neurologists. The Trust had relied on long term locum consultants, leading to some short-term gaps in provision.

The shortage of Neurologists nationally and the capacity issues within the neurology service at the Hospital led to a missed opportunity for Mr PENNICOTT to receive earlier specialist assessment.","On 24 August 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Nicholas John PENNICOTT aged 61.

Nicholas' health had been deteriorating and at the time of his death he had been waiting over 8 weeks to see a neurologist following an urgent referral.

He had had several other spinal operations before then. He developed infection and abscesses, and the evidence showed that the most likely origin of that infection was the surgery that he had in January. He died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital on the 3rd March 2022.

As part of the investigation, I reviewed the medical records. These included medical records from the time of his surgery at Spire Hospital in Portsmouth, but also included outpatient appointments (as a private patient) with [REDACTED] on (inter alia) 29th December 2021 (by telephone), 26th January 2022, and 23rd February 2022.

My investigation revealed that[REDACTED] made no formal medical records of the outpatient appointments. It is right to point out that[REDACTED] letters dictated and typed up by his secretary (to the patient and his GP), and some of this correspondence is relatively detailed. It was advanced on his behalf that this correspondence effectively represents a medical record and it is entirely appropriate to make 'records' in this way.

I did not accept that this correspondence is as full as a medical record would be. Much of the correspondence relates predominantly to plans and proposed courses of action, rather than a record of the patient's condition at that time.

In questioning, [REDACTED] accepted that much of the further information which he gave at the inquest (and referred to in a witness statement) is not recorded anywhere other than his own personal memory.

Even leaving aside GMC requirements in relation to record-keeping, it is plainly the case that records are important for patient safety, and storing information about a patient in an individual doctor's memory is clearly unacceptable. Leaving aside the issue of protection for the clinician, this approach carries a risk for patients.

I was clear at the inquest that I had no reason to disbelieve the additional evidence which [REDACTED] brought to the inquest - both in his oral evidence in court and in his witness statement - but I am concerned about the risks of this continued approach for other patients. In questioning, [REDACTED] clarified that his intention is to continue practising in this way.

Adequate medical records are fundamental to patient safety, particularly when patients are receiving treatment from numerous clinicians and organisations both in the private sector and in the NHS.

I did not find that the record-keeping approach in this case contributed to Mr Lawrence's death, but I remain concerned of a risk to other patients, in adopting this approach.","The issue about which I have concern is clear.

[REDACTED] should review his record-keeping approach, perhaps with the benefit of legal advice and reference to GMC guidance. An approach of 'storing' information in an individual clinician's memory carries a risk (including a risk of death) for future patients.","I conducted an inquest into the death of Peter William Frederick Lawrence, which concluded on 15th March 2023.

She was on the near side of a mobile crane intending to turn left into Headley Way. She was knocked off her pedal cycle by the crane and run over.  

There were significant blind spots for the crane driver to the nearside. This is apparent from the report of [REDACTED] and the photographs therein. In addition to the issue of the blind spots,[REDACTED] also stated that an overarching issue is the cycle lane and the left turn at the traffic light junction which results in vulnerable road users coming into direct conflict with vehicles intending to turn left into Headley Way.","I note there have been audits both pre and post accident and, as outlined, I had the benefit of a statement and oral evidence from of OCC, Group Manager Traffic and Road Safety.  I understand there are planned mitigation measures, to include amending the traffic signal timings to give advanced cycle priority on green. Further, there is the plan to drop the kerb to enable cyclists to join Headley Way off carriageway. I understood that the signal change and dropped kerb were due to take place in late August/September and I would be grateful if you could provide an update.  

I also understand that OCC have committed to undertake a Stage 4 RSA Safety Audit after the works have been completed and it will be helpful if I could be provided with the result of this in due course. 

I also heard about a Vulnerable Road User's Audit and enquire if there is a place for this at the location.  

During the course of the Inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concerns. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken.  In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to make this report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:  
The first and main concern is in relation to the nearside cycle lane and what appeared to be an element of confusion or perhaps a dilemma for cyclists at this location intending to cycle straight across the junction. The cycle lane puts cyclists on the nearside of a lane that is specifically for vehicles turning right into Headley Way. There is the box/advanced stop line in front of the line of traffic in the lane but this requires the cyclist to decide to use it and, importantly, to have time to make it pass the nearside of the vehicles and into the box before the vehicles in the lane commence their right turn.  If there was no cycle lane, it appears more likely that a cyclist heading straight across would position themselves in lane 2 for vehicles also heading straight on. I believe that further consideration should be given to this issue and if improved signage has a part to play to mitigate the risks. I appreciate of course that it is not possible to remove risk completely and cyclists will make different choices about where to position themselves at a junction such as this one. I anticipate that the junction is not dissimilar to many others in Oxford. The issue of cyclists in nearside blind spots, particularly involving large commercial vehicles with limited visibility, therefore presents a significant and ongoing risk. 2. The second concern relates to the width of the cycle lane. It is believed to be 0.95 metres wide at this location but the recommended width is 1.2m or perhaps 1.5m. I understand this is an issue which has already been raised following a site meeting. There may be valid reasons why the lane is the width it is but I would be grateful if this could be considered.",,In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report.

Mr Carruthers was self aware of his condition and learnt to manage it, it is noted that he heard voices as part of his paranoid schizophrenia diagnosis even when stable. Whilst compliant to taking his medication, Mr Carruthers was stable. Mr Carruthers compliance with medication over time decreased and he subsequently stopped taking his medication. Mr Carruthers was not on medication at the time of arrest and subsequent transfer to HMP Birmingham.

Mr Carruthers was arrested on the 09/04/21 and was taken to Perry Barr Police Station.Whilst in custody at Perry Barr Police Station, Mr Carruthers underwent a Mental Health Act Assessment on the 10/04/21 which determined he was fit to be interviewed and did not meet the criteria for detention under the Mental Health Act 1983.Mr Carruthers arrived on remand at HMP Birmingham on 12/4/2021. He was sentenced to 66 days imprisonment on 6/5/2021.Mr Carruthers underwent a reception medical screening at HMP Birmingham identifying his pacemaker. The resulting HMP Birmingham procedure is to raise a task, for a follow up on the pacemaker, this was not done. The reception medical screening did not identify Mr Carruthers mental health history or the Mental Health Act Assessment completed on the 10/4/2021. The HMP Birmingham procedure is a mental Health Nurse Review within 48 hours, this was not done. A mental health nurse attended Mr Carruthers cell on the 7/5/2021, this was triggered by concerns raised by Mr Carruthers family, to conduct an assessment. The assessment was completed from outside Mr Carruthers cell and was around one minute long. Mr Carruthers declined to input, he was polite but abrupt and the Nurse deemed Mr Carruthers had capacity to refuse mental health input.Mr Carruthers was moved to Lima Wing on 10/05/2021 to a double cell. At the time of his transfer to hospital he was a single occupant of this double cell. It is noted that Mr Carruthers had multiple cell mates during his time on Lima Wing. From evidence heard in court, having multiple cell mates does not trigger a Health Care review.A blood test was ordered on the 15/5/2021, it is unclear why it was ordered and why it was not undertaken.

There is a general agreement that during Mr Carruthers time on the Lima Wing he presented as reserved, shy and polite; he kept himself to himself.

The regime on Lima Wing changed regularly due to Covid restrictions and government regulations. It is generally accepted that the regime included a morning meal, delivered to Mr Carruthers cell, a hot meal to be collected from the servery and association and medicine collection.A summary of interaction between Prison staff and Mr Carruthers between the 25/5/2021 - 29/5/2021 based on limited CCTV and Prison Officer statements, shown during the inquest is as follows. Between the days of 25/5/21 and 29/5/2021, Mr Carruthers had multiple interactions with Prison Officers summarised as including food deliveries, unlocking of his cell and officers entering and leaving Mr Carruthers cell. The most notable event was when we last saw Mr Carruthers leave and return to his cell on the 25/5/21 having collected his hot meal. Following this we did not see Mr Carruthers leave his cell again. With regards to meals - we saw Mr Carruthers collect food once on the 25/05/21, had food delivered as customary between the 25/5/21 and 28/05/2021. Mr Carruthers did not have a hot meal on the 26/05/21 or 27/05/21 and his hot meals bought to him on the 28/05/21 and 29/05/21. Multiple statements show evidence of Mr Carruthers not wanting meals or association time. Evidence from Prison Officer statements show no concerns or observations raised or logged for Mr Carruthers during his time on Lima Wing up until 29/05/2021. Evidence shows that Prison Officers failed to notice a pattern due to no written log of observations or events.

A Prison Officer raised concerns regarding Mr Carruthers' health on the 19/05/2021 based on his presentation and appropriately escalated to his Custodial Manager. A Hotel 2, high est escalation, call was made to Prison Healthcare staff, to attend which occurred.

The Prison Nurse attended and conducted initial observations which promoted a 999 call.Paramedics attended and followed appropriate care, allocating roles to facilitate transfer to hospital and highlighting to Prison Officers that Mr Carruthers required a time critical transfer to City Hospital to gain essential input from the cardiac team.

Following treatment in his cell, Mr Carruthers was transferred to an ambulance for transfer to City hospital. Significant delays occurred in the Sterile Area of HMP Birmingham whilst paperwork, personnel and handcuff procedure were complete - it did not contribute to the death of Mr Carruthers


Upon presentation at City Hospital Mr Carruthers was extreamly unwell and was reviewed by the cardiac team. An ultrasound of the heart was used to quickly diagnose Mr Carruthers endocarditis and start treatment.When Mr Carruthers was admitted to the Acute Medical Unit he was at the point of multiple organ failure with septic shock, acute renal failure, hepatic failure, and delirium probably related to sepsis and cerebral hypoperfusion.Evidence suggests Mr Carruthers had staphylococcal endocarditus for weeks or potentially months prior to his hospital admission. 

Evidence suggests Mr Carruthers is likely to have developed sepsis in the 1-3 days prior to his hospital admission, leading to septic shock and multi-organ failure on admission to hospital. Mr Carruthers acute medical review led to a plan to take Mr Carruthers to New Cross Hospital, Wolverhampton on 3/6/2021 with a view to open heart surgery. There he was reviewed by 2 Consultant Cardiac Surgeons who felt that with multiorgan failure he was very unlikely to survive open heart surgery at that point and he was therefore transferred back to City Hospital.

During this time, Mr Carruthers was in a critical condition, it was noted that Mr Carruthers was hand cuffed during the transfer from City Hospital to New Cross Hospital, at the recommendation of the Govenor) despite multiple conversations with the Prison Officers present. This showed a lack of consideration to Mr Carruthers medical condition and the true risk to Hospital staff and the public.

Following his return to City Hospital, he became more drowsy and less responsive over the following days. He passed away peacefully on the morning of 14/6/2021.  

Following a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be: 
1a Cardiac tamponade. Hypostatic pneumonia 
1b Haemorrhagic pericarditis 
1c Infective endocarditis (implanted electronic cardiac pacemaker for 2nd degree atrio- ventricular block). ","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.
   
The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
At the time Mr Carruthers resided in HMP Birmingham, National Offender Management Service, Adult Safeguarding in Prison Policy, PSI 16/2015 dated 31/3/19 was in force. This policy states at paragraph 1.10 (under the heading 'Mandatory Actions') ""Governors must have systems in place to protect adult prisoners from abuse and neglect"". At paragraph 2.4 the policy states ""Neglect also includes self-neglect, which covers a wide range of behaviour such as neglecting to care for one's personal hygiene, health or surroundings and behaviour such as hoarding"". 

My concern is that while there is a national policy dealing with safeguarding, to include instances of self-neglect, no adequate training exists at either national or local level to ensure the effective implementation of that policy. 

While evidence was heard from prison staff detailing a number of potential escalation routes for what might be termed 'social isolation' (an instance, as with Mr Carruthers, where they had not left their cell for a period of days but had not declared they were self isolating), notably ACCT and CISP, none of the officers appeared aware of a corresponding process for raising safeguarding issues. 

The known escalation routes (ACCT and CISP) are more focussed on violence and self- harm, leaving at the very least a conceptual gap in how best to deal with injurious activity which is neither violent nor directly/obviously contributory to self-harm, such as self-neglect. 

My concern is that the existing safeguarding escalation process is either inadequate, inappropriately trained or both.","On 21 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Floyd Everton CARRUTHERS. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest. 

The conclusion of the inquest was;  
Conclusion of the Jury as to the death  
These are the points that the Jury have discussed and reached a unanimous decision based on the following:

The fact the Mr Carruthers died of an infected heart valve and this was from a natural condition.The fact that Mr Carruthers had probably had the infection for weeks if not months.Based upon the evidence heard in court, on the balance of probabilities the source of infection was not contributed to by the pressure sores found on Mr Carruthers body.A blood test was ordered on 15/05/2021 but was not carried out. Based upon the evidence heard in court a blood test may have shown markers of inflammation and possibly infection which could have prompted earlier intervention.The Prison staff involved in delivering the regime on Lima Wing in relation to Mr Carruthers from 10/05/2021 - 29/5/2021 had 10 weeks basic training at the start of their service but had insufficient ongoing mandatory training and understanding of the matters contained in the National Offender Management Service, Adult Safeguarding in Prison Policy, PIS 16/2015 dated 31/3/19, to enable them to undertake their role in compliance with that policy. As per evidence heard in court there was no safeguarding training in place during the period of Mr Carruthers incarceration. The Prison staff on Lima Wing and the HMP Birmingham Healthcare staff took insufficient steps to safeguard Mr Carruthers throughout the period 10/5/2021 - 29/5/2021. This includes insufficient record keeping, handover and escalation of events, such as missed meals and not leaving his cell.There were failures of Prison staff to make a referral to healthcare in response to Mr Carruthers condition, as reflected in his overall pattern of behaviour and his presentation, between 25/5/2021- 29/5/2021 As a result the Jury have reached a conclusion that death was contributed to by neglect.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 2 March 2023.

Sylvia attended Ufford Park Hotel and Spa on the 30th November 2021 for a meal. Prior to leaving the hotel, Sylvia went to use the toilet facilities. The closest toilet facilities were located down a flight of stairs. Sylvia fell down this flight of stairs.  No signage was in place in the vicinity, that would have indicated the availability of an accessible toilet on the same level as an alternative option. 

The injuries she sustained as a result of the fall were extensive, and led to Sylvia being admitted to Ipswich Hospital. Whilst being treated for her injuries at Ipswich Hospital, Sylvia developed aspiration pneumonia which was the medical cause of her death. 

The injuries sustained in the fall, cerebral haemorrhages and spinal injuries, were contributing factors to her death.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters given rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. 

In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you, the MATTERS OF CONCERN as follows.  
Evidence was heard that Sylvia had underlying medical issues that required an easily accessible toilet facility.  The jury concluded that the lack of appropriate signage, to readily identify an easily accessible toilet facility, was a directly contributory factor leading to Sylvia's death.  

The Local Authority Food and Safety Officer who investigated this case identified no other contributing factors, with the stairs themselves meeting building and safety regulations.  

The officers report contained only one recommendation for the premises owner, which was the provision of more adequate signage.  

However, the officer stated in evidence that there was no statutory power to enforce the provision of such signage, and should a premises owner wish to ignore such a recommendation, they could (it is acknowledged that the premise owner in this case has put new signage in place). In addition, current building regulations do not require any such signage to be fitted into new buildings.  

The court was informed that the provision of adequate accessible toilet facilities is now a legal requirement for the majority of buildings designed for public use, but as detailed above there is no requirement for these facilities to be clearly identified with appropriate signage.  

As a failure to provide adequate signage was found to be a contributing factor in this case, and there is no enforceable requirement that such signage should be provided, I am concerned further deaths may occur in other public access buildings, should similar circumstances arise in the future.","On 9th December 2021 I commenced an investigation into the tragic death of Sylvia Frances PRICE.

The opinion initially provided by the pathologist was that the cause of death was unascertained. However, having heard evidence at the Inquest of a paternal family history of pre-mature cardiac related deaths, she changed this to Sudden Cardiac Death.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern) 

Mr Price (Andrew) was remanded to HMP Durham on 10 September 2020. He died there, aged 28 years, on 20 September 2020. The evidence of the pathologist at the Inquest was that the medical cause of death was Sudden Cardiac Death (this was an amendment from her original opinion that the cause of death was un-ascertained). The pathologist explained that this death would have followed sudden arrhythmia. She concluded thus after hearing evidence of a paternal family history of premature cardiac related deaths. Clearly this is a comparatively rare condition and one where diagnosis is extremely difficult: it occurs in people who are young and physically fit; there can be an absence of clear symptoms before hand. In Andrew's case this was complicated further because he was suffering from what are sadly common problems for prison inmates - he had serious mental health and personality disorder issues and was an established abuser of substances - illicit and otherwise. Such symptoms as there might have been (breathlessness and reported chest pains) in the days and hours leading up to his unexpected death were readily confusable and could have been associated with drug withdrawal (he was subject to a methadone care plan) and mental and emotional distress (he was reported to be suffering from extreme anxiety and paranoia). The best, in some cases the only, way to predict a pre-disposition to a death of this nature is by reference it to family medical history of such, or similar, occurrences. Once this is known, the person can then be referred for genetic screening. Sadly, in Andrew`s case no one in healthcare, some of whom had been familiar with him for years from previous terms of imprisonment, had any knowledge of the family history, as it did not feature on system one, and Andrew had never volunteered it. Equally, he had never been asked about it. This is not a criticism, simply a statement of fact made starkly relevant by the circumstances, unusual though they are.

The head of healthcare at HMP Durham gave evidence, when asked directly by me, that provision for a question in the reception health screen template about any family history of sudden cardiac death could help to prevent deaths of this kind reccurring at the prison. She, with the health care provider for HMP Durham (Spectrum Community Health), has helpfully and very pro-actively put this into immediate effect locally (at HMP Durham and those other prisons covered by the health care provider). Specifically, the second health screen template (see attached - at pages 7 and 8) now shows that a question with regards family history (FH) of a 'FH: Cardiac Disorder (incl. Sudden Cardiac Death)' has been added to the second reception screen. The updating of the first reception health screen template is currently in hand.

Additionally, the health care provider proposed the introduction of a read code specifically for 'FH: Sudden Cardiac Death' in the SystmOne template. This read code does not currently exist in SystmOne and so locally, the health care provider has now added it as a prompt in the read code for 'FH: Cardiac Disorder (XM1Jv)' and add to this '(incl. Sudden Cardiac Death)'. By adding 'FH: Sudden Cardiac Death' as a read code in its own right, it will make it easier to search for and flag on the SystmOne records of prisoners so staff can clearly see and be aware of this previous family history.

The purpose of this report to you is that you might take appropriate similar steps nationally.","On 24 September 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Joseph Andrew PRICE aged 28. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 18 January 2023.

At 11.12 a 999 call was made by a passer by but there were still ""no available resources "". 
At 12.16 there was a further 999 call. The incident remained a category three and was ""still pending in the dispatch queue waiting for resources to become available "". 
At 12.41 a call was made to Mrs. Taylor's location but there were "" still no available resources to send"" 
At 13.12 A further 999 call was made "" awaiting resources to become available"" 
At 13.48 Patient location was called she was now in and out of consciousness and although she remained a category 3 an audit of the call decided that she should have been upgraded to a category 2 or 1. ""Still no available resources"".
At 14.42 further 999 call but again ""no available resources"". 
At 15.25 Case reviewed to a category 2.
At 16.29 An ambulance was despatched arriving at 17.15. This was 6hours 47 minutes after the original call and 1hour 49 minutes after category 2 upgrade.
Mrs Taylor arrived at the hospital at 17.57 and when assessed in the emergency department her Glasgow Comma score was recorded as 3.She died later the same day.","On 07 October 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Rita Maureen TAYLOR aged 84.

There was no wound swab or liaison with microbiology; a lumbar MRI scan was not carried out and no antibiotics were administered. Mrs Dick was transferred to Broomfield Hospital from Queens Hospital with a likely Grade 4 pressure ulcer and osteomyelitis.

Since that time, he had been under the care of the community mental health team with a period of care under the home treatment team in July 2021 following a short admission for a relapse in his condition. At his last review in September 2021, he was noted to be well but concern was expressed about lack of compliance with medication due to some side effects. On 02/12/21 he was noted by a resident at his shared accommodation to be hallucinating, having smashed a window and threated to eat the glass. Police and paramedics attended and he was taken to Good Hope Hospital emergency department where he arrived at 01.45. He was assessed by the mental health liaison service and a psychiatric doctor as needing a full Mental Health Act assessment which was undertaken at 11.30 on 03/12/21. The assessment concluded that he did require further treatment due to a relapse in his condition caused by non- compliance with his medication. He agreed to a voluntary admission, further assessment and recommencement of his medication. He remained in the Emergency department whilst attempts were made to find a bed. At the time there was a national shortage of mental health beds. Staff from the hospital notified the police that he had left the department at 13.41 and that he was at risk of harming himself. There was a failure to treat Mr Hamilton as a missing person at this time, a failure by the mental health services to refer him to the home treatment team for a safe and well check and he was not assessed by the street triage team. At 18.58 police were notified by his landlord that he had left his property following a mental health episode and he was reported to have drunk bleach. No action was taken in relation to this log. At 19.51 police found Mr Hamilton walking on the footpath alongside the dual carriageway near The Fort shopping village after a member of the public reported seeing a man walking in the road. Mr Hamilton reported to officers that he suffered from depression and was out walking to clear his head. Police noted that he was cold and wet and had recently been assessed at Good Hope Hospital and he agreed to be taken to Birmingham Heartlands hospital for further assessment. At the hospital he was triaged by a nurse and noted to be suicidal. He was taken to the escalation room to wait to be assessed. He was not seen again and was noted to be missing from the department at 05.28 on 05/12/21. It is not known when he left the department. There was a failure to report him missing at this time. On 06/12/21 the deceased was found by a member of the public who was walking his dog, in the middle of the river[REDACTED] Stechford lying on his back on a rock. He was confirmed deceased at the scene by[REDACTED] at 12.20. His whereabouts since he left the emergency department on or around 4/5th December 2021 are unknown and whilst he had previously indicated suicidal ideation, his intentions at the time of his death are unknown. There were several failures in his care which amount to missed opportunities to help Mr Hamilton; however, it is not possible to say whether the outcome could have been different.

Following a post mortem, the medical cause of death was determined to be:
1a Drowning 1b Psychosis","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
1.Lack of inpatient mental health beds and lack of Psychiatric decisions unit (PDU) spaces: The inquest heard how there was a regional and national lack of inpatient beds and spaces in PDU. Consideration is needed urgently to fund further mental health beds and PDU spaces to ensure patients are not kept unattended in extremely busy emergency departments.
2.Safe space: The inquest heard how it is often the case that due to the lack of inpatient beds and PDU spaces patients are often left in the Emergency department unattended or sent home with periodic reviews by the home treatment team whilst waiting for a bed. This means that acutely ill mental health patients are often left for long periods without any specialist care, support or observation. Consideration should be given to setting up a safe space where patients can wait for a bed or PDU space which is able to cater for their special needs and keep them safe.
3.Multi agency protocol for informal missing patients: The inquest heard how there is no agreed protocol to deal with informal patients who abscond from emergency departments. Consideration should be given to setting up an agreed protocol so that all agencies involved understand their respective roles and responsibilities.
4.WMP Missing person investigations: The inquest heard how on 2 occasions (03/12/21 and 07/12/21) there was a failure to treat Mr Hamilton as a missing person when he was reported as missing. On both occasions he should have been treated as a high risk missing person. This raises a serious concern that staff do not understand when people should be classified as missing. Consideration should be given to ensuring staff properly understand how to assess if someone should be treated as a missing person and WMP should consider whether further training is required.
5.WMP risk assessments for missing persons: When Mr Hamilton was first reported as missing no risk assessment was undertaken about his level of risk to himself. The call had confirmed he was at risk of harming himself. The leads to a concern that staff do not understand when and how to risk assess incidents and when to identify high risk incidents.","On 18 January 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Leroy Patrick HAMILTON.

During the course of evidence, I also established that John was not being monitored any more closely than other prisoners due to his seizure activity.

I asked additional questions of witnesses and asked to have sight of policies and procedures in respect of information sharing protocols and procedures in respect of prisoners with chronic conditions, (be is seizure activity, diabetes, cardiac issues). My concern being that there did not appear to be a clear process for prisoners to consent to disclosure of medical information to front line officers so that they could be made aware that a particular prisoner may be prone to sudden or unexpected medical episodes.

My concern was that a prisoner could have a sudden (but perhaps predictable) acute medical episode and front line prison staff may not be made aware of what was causing the issue or how to respond thereto.","On 7 June 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of John Allen

In March 2019 the Deceased had a check-up at a private hospital. An abdominal ultrasound scan showed a large vascular lesion in the liver. 

On 26 March 2019, the Deceased attended his general practice to discuss the scan result and an MRI scan was recommended. 

The MRI scan was undertaken on 29th May 2019. 

At a follow up GP appointment on 10th June 2019 it was advised that if the patient remained asymptomatic there should be an ultrasound scan in 1 year. 

The Deceased contacted the surgery and requested follow up scans in April 2020 and July 2021. Follow-up scans were arranged through the GP. 

In September 2021 an ultrasound scan showed that the liver lesion had increased in size and there was mild intrahepatic biliary dilatation.

The Deceased was subsequently admitted to hospital on 12 October 2021 and sadly passed away on 8 November 2021.

A post-mortem confirmed that the cause of death was due to acute liver failure and liver infarction following embolization of the hepatic artery to arrest severe haemorrhage as a consequence of a percutaneous biliary drain insertion for the management of obstructive jaundice secondary to a large hepatocellular adenoma.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
A partner in the Deceased's general practice gave evidence to the Inquest that the practice uses the EMIS system, and that, unlike SystmOne, the system does not have a scheduled task feature which would allow the GP to create an alert on a patient's record to flag up when a task is due at a future date - eg an alert to book a follow up scan in one year.

I have been informed that EMIS does allow a future entry into a patient's record (a diary date), but this must be for a specific clinical code and the only way to see that there is a due diary date entry is to access the patient's record and view the summary page or diary section. Unless the GP has reason to inspect the patient's clinical record and examine the summary or diary pages there is no way of being alerted that a new task needs to be completed for that patient. Further, it is not possible to add a pop-up-linked diary date entry for a specific task (such as a scan) outside the EMIS determined list.

This creates a situation where the responsibility for ensuring that follow up investigations are undertaken at the correct time is placed onto the patient, and the patient will have to contact the GP to request follow-up.

In this case the Deceased was diligent in contacting his GP surgery to request repeat scans, but I consider that unless some action is taken there is a continuing risk of patients not contacting the GP to make a request for follow-up and therefore becoming lost to necessary follow-up.","On 11th November 2021 I commenced an investigation into the death of Hugo Carlos (age 30 years). 

The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest on 12th January 2023. 

The conclusion of the inquests into the death was: 
Mr Carlos died from liver infarction and liver failure following an interventional radiology procedure to embolize bleeding from a fistula between the hepatic artery and bile duct. This was a recognised risk of a potentially life-saving and necessary medical procedure. The fistula developed following an interventional radiology procedure to insert a biliary drain into the bile duct. Bleeding following biliary drain insertion was a known risk of this medical procedure. The biliary drain was necessary to treat obstructive jaundice which was caused by a hepatocellular adenoma, which grew and obstructed the bile duct, causing Mr Carlos to experience symptoms of obstructive jaundice in late August 2021. The hepatocellular adenoma was first seen as an incidental finding on an ultra sound scan in March 2019. The hepatocellular adenoma was diagnosed as a focal nodular hyperplasia on MRI scan with contrast reported in June 2019. From a liver biopsy taken on 26th October 2021 and on Post Mortem the liver lesion was diagnosed not as a focal nodular hyperplasia, but as a hepatocellular adenoma.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe your organisation has the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by 29th March 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
Evidence received during the investigation and inquest (and corroborated by the family) demonstrated that nursing staff were trying to manage and care for patients in the very best way that they could. However, they were hampered in their efforts for the following reasons:

1. Despite requesting additional nursing staff, the Bargeod ward was short-staffed when Mrs White fell. There did not appear to be any documented plan or procedure in place for how patients would be safely managed when it was not possible (because of staff shortage) to carry out the level of care for individual patients that they had been assessed as requiring.

2. The ward is L-shaped and the patients on the ward are managed in individual cubicles. Mrs White should have been in view of nursing staff as part of her Level 4 enhanced care ('observation of cohorted patients'). However, it was not possible to provide the observations that Mrs White required because:
a. Patients were inside cubicles and therefore out of sight of staff and,
b. The ward itself was L-shaped.

3. The Bargoed ward is a stroke ward and one where it is usual to see patients who have a high risk of falls and mobility difficulties. Prior to Covid-19 it was explained that staff would take patients who required the Enhanced Care to the dayroom so that they could be under the required observation. Since Covid-19, this had not been possible. To counteract the logistical difficulties faced by staff in observation of Enhanced Care patients on the ward it was explained that patients are now moved to their cubicle doorway for periods of the day so that they are in sight of nursing staff. This appeared to be ineffective because:
a. The particular care needs/wishes of a patient may mean that is not suitable.
b. That only accounts for part of the day.

4. To further counteract the difficulties with observing patients on Enhanced Level 4 care it was explained that clip-on alarm sensors were used. There was evidence given that patients are able to simply unclip these sensors, rendering the system ineffective.

A Falls Review Panel had noted that Providing Level 4 Enhanced Care on this ward was extremely challenging and that quality care at Level 4 was unachievable in a single room environment. It was noted that the Corporate Nursing Team had reviewed the Enhanced Care Policy in light of the fact it did not fit single room environment, however at the time of the inquest it did not appear from evidence received that a further plan to manage Level",,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.

a) The Greater Manchester Police Incident Response Policy governed thegrading of an Incident in relation to priority and the response time to an Incident.

b) Inrelationtothegradingofthelncid.entrelatingtotheDeceased,which was reported at 18.09 hours on the 29th of January 2021, the Incident was graded correctly as a Grade 2 Priority Response with a response time of 1 hour but a police officer only attended more than 8 hours after the report of the Incident with the Incident having been referred to NWAS without a police officer attending.

c) The Greater Manchester Police Incident Response Policy makes no reference of an option to refer the Incident to a 3rd Party, such as NWAS, but there is no specific reference in the Policy that the attendance must be by a police officer and that the responsibility to
attend must not be passed to a 3rd party or any other agency.

d) I am concerned that unless the Greater Manchester Police IncidentResponse Policy is reviewed police officers will not attend Incidents within the timescales referred to in the Policy and there will be an opportunity to pass the responsibility to 3rdparty agencies, which may lead to a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken.

2) I request that you conduct a review of the following concerns

In my opinion, there is a continuing risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken in relation to the concerns set out below. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you. 

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: 
As stated in my Conclusion (above), Jordan Pry died on the M25 motorway at marker post B4348, when he drove his vehicle through an area of surface water and the car began to aquaplane and rotate, causing it to leave the carriageway and collide with a tree. There is a long and significant history of aquaplaning incidents at the location, including a previous similar fatality following which, in 2010, a Prevention of Future Deaths Report was issued by the then Senior Coroner for Surrey. That report drew attention to the presence of surface water from rain and the effects of a blocked drain, and the presence of a flat spot on the road. Subsequently, changes were made to the drainage system at the location, first in 2011 by means of a small scale improvement scheme and secondly, as part of works completed in 2015, by means of the introduction of a slot drain. However, the flat spot still remains and aquaplaning incidents have continued. I was told in evidence that there are ongoing investigations concerning the risk arising at the location, that a decision as to whether or not the flat spot should be addressed is still to be taken, and that a comprehensive plan for the management of the risk at the location cannot be made until that decision is taken. The concern arising, therefore, is that there is an ongoing risk of further death at this location pending the implementation of an informed and comprehensive plan for risk management.","I commenced an investigation into the death of Jordan Kevin Pry. 
The inquest concluded on the 22nd December 2022 when I found that the medical cause of death was :  
Ia Multiple Injuries 
and my Conclusion as to the death was that:   

In the early hours of the 2nd April 2018, Jordan Pry was driving his BMW-M3 motor car along the anti-clockwise carriageway of the M25 motorway, between junctions 6 and 5, and in an easterly direction. It was raining heavily and the road surface was wet. Jordan Pry was driving in the third of four lanes, at a speed of approximately 78 miles per hour, when he drove through an area of surface water on the road and the car began to aquaplane and rotate. Whilst still rotating, the vehicle travelled across the second and first lanes and then left the carriageway to the nearside in the vicinity of marker post B4348, which is approximately 200 metres before the start of the slip-road to the Clacket Lane Services. The car then moved down or over the verge and steep embankment to the nearside of the road and collided with a tree. As a result of the collision and its force, the tree intruded into the vehicle from its offside central pillar and through the driver's compartment, causing Jordan Pry to suffer fatal injuries. The collision occurred at hours on the 2nd April 2018 and it is likely that Jordan Pry died shortly thereafter, although his death was formally pronounced, at the scene, at 02.52 hours, following the arrival of the emergency services.

The probable causes of the collision and Jordan Pry's death were :
(i) The presence of excessive surface water on the road which resulted from
(a) heavy rainfall,
(b) blockage of a drain in the central reservation at a point approximately 65 metres south-west of the collision location which had been caused, unusually, by a large piece of plastic entering the drainage system and which resulted in there being a flow of water across the carriageway, and
(c) the profile of the road on the approach to the collision location which included a flat spot where the surface water was able to settle, and

(ii) The speed at which the BMW was being driven, namely a speed of approximately 78 miles per hour.

Prior to the collision there was a long history of wet-road related incidents at the location, including many aquaplaning events and a previous fatality. The absence of any warning on the approach to the collision location of the risk of aquaplaning, which was known to arise when there was excessive surface water on the road, and the absence of any vehicle restraint system at the nearside of the carriageway, were both possible contributory causes of the Deceased's death.

Jordan Pry died as a result of a Road Traffic Collision.",,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by the 25th February 2023. I, as coroner, may extend the period.

The impact of his age and multiple medical conditions complicated his treatment and impacted recovery.,"During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.  

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)  
1) Evidence at inquest revealed that none of the nursing care plan risk assessments, which had been completed on Mr Blower's arrival on the ward, had been updated during his stay. I heard evidence that there were changes to his clinical presentation that were recorded in the nursing notes and that these should have been reflected in updated risk assessments. The multi factorial falls risk assessment had not been fully completed on admission nor fully updated after an in-patient fall by Mr Blower. 

The evidence I heard from the nursing staff was that they are potentially missing opportunities for nursing interventions when risk assessments are not updated and that they do not always have the time to review the nursing notes. 

I note that the hospital is carrying out audits of documentation completion and updating some systems. However, some 2 years after the death of Mr Blower, the ward manager stated in evidence that her reviews of care plans showed a huge variety in the level of completion and that concordance with documentation remained poor. The hospital witnesses noted that staff were under significant time pressure and completing documentation is not seen as a priority. 

2) Mr Blower was found to be dehydrated and he required IV fluids during his admission. The hospital nutrition policy (section entitled hydration) states that it is the responsibility of the registered nurse and medical practitioner to ensure patients receive adequate fluids and that a minimum of 7 drinks should be provided daily. 

In evidence I was informed that the nurses monitor fluid intake by keeping an eye on water levels in patients' jugs (for those not deemed to require fluid intake charts). There is no-one on a ward with overall responsibility for ensuring that the trust policy on hydration is adhered to. Representations from the hospital state that other members of staff also keep an eye on nutrition. This was not sufficient to prevent Mr Blower from becoming seriously dehydrated.","On 03 November 2020 I commenced an investigation into the death of Anthony David BLOWER aged 83. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 08 December 2022.

A DNAR was in place. She had previously suffered with pneumonia and Septicaemia, and had an amputation of her leg and finger due to blood clots. Her family had been advised that there was nothing further that could have been done for her medically.

On the 28th of June 2022, at approximately 1000 hours, Mrs ELLISON had been due her medication around this time. One of the care workers went into her room to give her her medications and check on her, as it was unusual for Mrs ELLISON not to have not pressed the call button for her medications before this time. When the careworker went in, she noticed that Mrs ELLISON was very drowsy and sleepy. As such, she turned the lights on and noticed she was pale.

With this, the care assistant has took her observations, which were concerning. Consequently, she informed the registered staff nurse before calling for an ambulance. As the care assistant returned to the office to make her call, the registered staff nurse informed her that Mrs Ellison had already passed away and it was therefore too late.

As such, police and Mrs Ellison's GP were called. The GP attended and pronounced time of death at 1352 hours.

Mrs Ellison's son stated he had raised a concern to the care home 4-6 weeks ago about medication being left in his mother's room, as she had been observed hiding it under the bed covers. He had been informed that the staff would administer the morphine and observe her taking it from then on. Mrs Ellison's son was concerned that there had been no change in the care home practice since his earlier complaint, which may have led to his mother taking an accidental overdose of her medication.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern.

Mrs Ellison was resident at Alexandra Care Home and was found deceased on 28th June 2022 by staff.

She attended the emergency department of the George Eliot Hospital NHS Trust (GEH) and was sent home with a diagnosis of migraine.  

By the 28 April 2022 Carol was experiencing a sentinel bleed, and this led to a change in symptoms. She returned to GEH.  

The changes in symptoms were such that further investigations should have been undertaken (either a CT scan or a lumbar puncture) and such an investigation may or may not have revealed the presence of an aneurysm and that Carol was at risk of a subarachnoid haemorrhage.  

However, due to an incorrect diagnosis of migraine, further investigations did not take place and Carol was sent home.  

A further safety check, as laid down by Royal College of Emergency Medicine guidelines, was not followed. The guidelines state that where there is an unexpected return to the emergency department with 72 hours, there should be a discussion with a consultant before discharge. 

Carol suffered a cardiac arrest on 30 April 2022 and was admitted to the University Hospital Coventry and Warwickshire where she died on 1 May 2022.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. 
(1) The subsequent investigation by GEH highlighted two areas which needed addressing:

· The need to raise awareness of subarachnoid haemorrhage masquerading as a migraine and the need to investigate possible neurological findings. This had been done by means of discussions in meetings and a poster displayed in a staff area.
· Doctors were not familiar with the Royal College Guidance that there is a need to discuss with a consultant, all patients who unexpectedly return within 72 hours of discharge from the emergency department This had been done by circulating an aide memoire to be given to those in training and existing members of the department.

(2) It was stated that the middle grade doctor who discharged Carol at her second attendance on 28 April 2022 was trained at a reputable institute overseas where Royal College guidance was not applicable. He had undergone a significant period of training and familiarisation and assessment at GEH, but it was not clear as to the way in which his understanding and appreciation of the appropriate guidelines had been assessed.

(3) The document (described as an aide memoire) which notified all doctors of the Royal College Guidance referred to other matters such as punctuality and staff sick leave. Matters critical to patient care were not clearly identified and given appropriate prominence.

(4) It did not appear that all doctors would have been present at meetings where the learning points were discussed.

(5) The evidence made it clear that the individuals concerned had subsequently undergone appropriate training and reflection to avoid any recurrence. However, it was less clear how either learning point identified would be embedded in the team as a whole and conveyed to new members joining the team, particularly those joining the team at a more senior level, who would not previously have operated within the guidelines.

(6) Although staff members would have the opportunity of accessing the material, there did not appear to be any checks to ensure that staff members had considered and understood the material provided.


(7) It is requested that consideration be given to ensuring that where learning points relating to patient safety are identified, they are not only circulated to existing and future members of the team but that all doctors confirm their understanding and compliance.

(8) It is also requested that there is a review of training plans for more senior doctors who would not be familiar with Royal College and other guidelines, to ensure that guidance critical to patient safety is easily identified and that familiarity with any
such guidance is assessed.","On 10 May 2022, the senior coroner commenced an investigation into the death of Carol Ann Welch aged 47. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 6 January 2023.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
There was a failure at Hull Royal Infirmary to understand the process of implementing Section 5(2) of the Mental Health act 1983 [MHA] (Doctors Holding Power) as well as general uncertainty about its significance and effect. Mollie absconded from the ward whilst apparently under this section. The paperwork for the implementation of this section of the MHA 1983 was in fact not properly completed and hence invalid. Whilst the Hull & East Yorkshire NHS Trust has taken steps to educate doctors about this power, these were only local measures and I believe that all doctors working in England and Wales should be aware of section 5(2) and nurses of their equivalent power pursuant to section 5(4) of the MHA 1983 and that appropriate awareness and training should be given.","On 12th July 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Mollie Rose Stansfield, age 22 years.

The conclusion of the inquest was: NARRATIVE 
Mollie Rose Stansfield was born on 6th January 1997 in Hull and died on 10th July 2019 on Princes Quay, Hull after falling. She suffered multiple injuries as a result of this fall which resulted in her rapid death. She had an underlying diagnosis of Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, as well as a history of drug and alcohol abuse. She was admitted to the Avondale Unit on 27th June 2019 as an informal patient, after being transferred there following presentation to Hull Royal Infirmary with a self-inflicted neck wound which was appropriately treated. Whilst there she absconded and purchased a number of tablets, which she took, but did not tell the nursing staff who discovered it later that day. She was transferred back to Hull Royal Infirmary and treated for this overdose. Upon her return to the Avondale unit she became physically unwell and was sent back to Hull Royal Infirmary for investigation of what was thought to be a cardiorespiratory problem. This was refuted and it is likely that her physical symptoms were due to the systemic toxic effects of cocaine. She absconded from the ward on a number of other occasions and sourced whilst absent, which she took. She suffered a fit as a result of taking but recovered. A Section 5.2 Mental Health Act order was put in place, but was probably not valid at material times. She was discharged to step down accommodation following being declared medically fit and following assessment by a psychiatrist. She was evicted from the step down accommodation on 10th July following an altercation the previous evening, and went to a high rise block of flats with the intention of jumping off. Her friend however intervened, called the police who attended the flats and removed her to a place of safety, Miranda House, under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983. Following a mental health assessment at 13:00 on 10th July she was found neither to be psychotic nor intoxicated with. She subsequently took following her discharge and went to Princes Quay and fell to her death. The effects may have clouded her judgment but equally the text message exchanges prior to her assessment at the Section 136 suite and after her release suggested that she intended to take her own life.","In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you as Chief executive of NHS England have the power to take such action.

The evidence at inquest indicated that Miss Powell had purchased a paddleboard from Tesco at Llandudno Junction on the evening of the 14th of July 2022, that she had taken it to Conwy Morfa and had thereafter used it in an unsafe manner, whereby she did not wear any life saving equipment and the safety leash on the board was by way of an ankle leash which was inappropriate for the fast flowing water.

The evidence further indicated that at the point of sale, there was no safety advice or guidance provided in relation to either the advisory wearing of a safety vest, or the need to be aware that the positioning of a safety leash should take into account the environment/water conditions where the paddleboard is to be used as per the below information:

Unless action is taken to improve the provision of information to purchasers of paddleboards and/or to regulate the sale of paddleboards to ensure that the provision of advice of this nature becomes a mandatory requirement at the point of retail sale, then there is an ongoing risk that further accidents will occur and that lives may be lost as a result.","On the 16th Of July 2022 I commenced an investigation into the death of Emma Louise Powell (DOB 22.10.97 DOD 15.7.2).

She had had a 35 year history with mental health services. Samantha arrived at Sturdee Community Hospital (a locked female rehabilitation ward) in June of 2020, when her community placement had broken down and she could no longer be safely managed within the community.  

At the time of her death, Samantha was detained under s.3 of the Mental Health Act.  

On 17th September 2021 whilst on s.17 leave Samantha walked in front of a slow-moving vehicle, she was admitted to A&E with a minor injury to her knee and head injury where she had fallen backwards. She was discharged the same day.  

On return to Sturdee Community Hospital Samantha was placed on 15 minute observations but was found in her bathroom [REDACTED] Samantha was moved to a safety room.

On 14th October 2021 Samantha returned to her normal bedroom, room 5.

Observation levels were reduced from 15 minutes to 30 minutes on 21st and 22nd September, and then reduced to hourly observations on 23rd September 2021. The RAG rating records Samantha as being on hourly observations from 23rd September to the date of her death.

On 20th September 2021, Samantha was denied access to 'cables/chargers'. The Jury heard evidence that something coloured red on the RAG rating was a 'high risk'. Cables/chargers were highlighted red and remained contraband items from 20th September to the point of Samantha's death.

Samantha found transitions difficult to go somewhere she didn't know. On 21st October 2021 Samantha was informed that she would be moving to Aylestone Flats within the ground of Sturdee Community Hospital in preparation for moving to the community in the future. A Senior Registered MHN told the Jury that the thought of moving destabilised Samantha.

Samantha had heightened sensitivity as part of her Emotionally Unstable Personality Disorder, so a small thing (not receiving a text message) would be felt more strongly. Her Psychologist saw Samantha on the 21st October and described Samantha as anxious and the reasons for this were not receiving responses to her text messages and also leaving the hospital for a future placement (yet to be identified).

Samantha had been more agitated than usual over the course of the previous week and seeking staff support quite a lot.

No one could recall a discussion about Samantha's risk at the risk management meeting of 22nd October 2021 and if there was a discussion about Samantha's risk, her risk rating wasn't changed on the RAG document.

Various staff gave evidence as to Samantha's presentation on the 22nd October 2021, for example: Samantha was at around 3pm almost irritable; very unsettled and had been more agitated in the days prior to her death and seeking more 1-1 interactions. Samantha was described as unsettled, kept pacing and crying, this was different to what Samantha was like before. Samantha was said to be 'very very' anxious walking up and down asking for the doctor or the nurse in charge.

The CCTV evidence of Samantha on 22 October 2021 between 15.57 hours and 17.33 hours (when Samantha was last seen) showed that between 15.57 and 16.29 hours Samantha can be seen pacing the corridor 27 times within the 32 minute period, and between 16.29 and 17.33, a 64 minutes period, she can be seen pacing the corridor 70 times - more than 1 x per minute.

Health care assistants who were allocated general observations would be allocated these within a 1-hour period, for example 4pm to 5pm. The Jury heard how healthcare assistants had to observe and record the hourly observation for a patient on the hour every hour, none were told to record the actual time they observed the patient, nor was that the Inmind Healthcare Group Policy for Sturdee Community Hospital in place at the time. Healthcare assistants would locate the patient 5 minutes before the hour period was up and then record their observation on the hour and then move to their next patient.

As far as the purpose of conducting observations, the evidence of the healthcare assistants was that they needed to observe that the patient was safe and if the patient was sleeping, to check if the patient was breathing. Health care assistants were to record the location and what the patient was doing and also to record if the healthcare assistant interacted with the patient and anything else meaningful. If a patient was engaged with something (eg: watching tv) there wasn't an expectation to disturb the patient to interact with them.

There was a period of 1 hour and 12 minutes between Samantha closing her bedroom door and it being opened by a healthcare assistant and no was seen entering Samantha's room during that time. No one observed her.

Samantha was found at 18.45 hours in her bathroom on 22nd of October 2021 [REDACTED].

A nurse and healthcare assistant answered the alarm at 18.47, just under 2 minutes. There were difficulties in entering Samantha's bathroom because she was behind the door.

The 999 call to East Midlands Ambulance Service was received at 18.53 hrs, 8 minutes after the alarm was raised.

A trained paramedic co-incidentally arrived at the hospital to work in a different capacity and went to assist, arriving at Samantha's bedroom at 18.53 hours, the same time as the 999 call was being made. The Jury hard in evidence that there was no CPR in progress when she arrived. The paramedic said that ILS training was that you should commence early CPR.

The emergency response bag was delayed in being brought to the scene due to being situated on a different ward which required access to another building through locked doors. The defibrillator was being attached during the 999 call and at the point the trained paramedic arrived at the scene.

CPR was commenced at a time at least 8 minutes after the alarm was raised, and at a time at least 6 minutes after the alarm was answered. The defibrillator advised no shock indicating that there was no electrical activity within Samantha's heart (asystole). A second round of CPR as advised by the defibrillator, was commenced, but Samantha's pupils were fixed and dilated, she had mottled skin, which she described was a bruising effect when the body has been lying for some time and as advised by the Resuscitation Council UK, CPR was ceased to preserve Samantha's dignity.

Paramedics attended and Samantha was pronounced dead at 19:15 hours.","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: (brief summary of matters of concern)
1. Emergency Response

I heard during the course of the inquest that when an alarm sounded staff would attend the location of the alarm, assess the situation and then go and collect what equipment may be necessary to deal with the emergency.

At the time of Samantha's death there was only 1 emergency bag for the entire hospital (which had 2 wards and separate self-contained flats on the site). This has now been rectified and there is an emergency bag for every ward.

Staff partake in a drill and evidence provided to me for the purposes of Regulation 28 showed that response times of staff remain at 2 minutes to a patient's side.

However, I was told that the emergency response still has staff attend a patient, assess and then go and collect the emergency bag, rather than taking it immediately to the patient's side.

I was provided with evidence for the purposes of Regulation 28 by Inmind Healthcare Group which showed, for example, that in December of 2022 there were 64 incidents, 45 of which were self-harm, 2 of which were clinical incidents. 16 resulted in actual harm and a large number of those incidents concerned patients ligating.

To continue with an emergency response which delays the provision of life saving equipment to the patients' side is unsafe and in my opinion could lead to future deaths.

The delay in providing CPR to Samantha on balance had no causative effect on her death, but it could for another patient.

2. Observation Policy

At the time of Samantha's death observations were conducted and recorded in a predictable and prescriptive way by healthcare staff. The quality of observations recorded at the time of Samantha's death were such that they did not accord with the expectation of the policy and merely recorded where the patient was and what they were doing.

Effective observations were acknowledged as being a vital tool to assess and manage the risk of a patient.

Inmind Healthcare Group's new observation Policy states:

'Observations are a therapeutic intervention aimed at reducing factors which contribute to increased risk and promoting recovery. The use of enhanced observation levels should never be regarded as routine practice…….
Observation practice must focus on engaging the person therapeutically and enabling them to address their difficulties constructively. Our interactions must seek to create rapport which allows those in our care to feel valued and safe to share their experiences with us'.

Since Samantha's death changes have been made by Inmind Healthcare Group to their policy and practice, in that observations are now recorded at the precise time they are conducted and are infrequent in their predictability (eg: hourly observation should be conducted once hourly rather than on the hour every hour).

Evidence of recent observation records demonstrated that this was now practice.

However, there was a disconnect between the new policy and the pre-printed forms being used to record observations; what staff were being instructed to do and what they were recording. This was confusing and the evidence produced did not support the expectations of the new policy or demonstrate it had become embedded practice. The evidence produced did not support a change in staff recording quality observations, so that whilst precise and intermittent timings were evidenced, beyond the location of the patient or what they were doing, the actual presentation of the patient was not being recorded.","On 29 October 2021, I commenced an investigation into the death of Samantha Jane BOAZMAN aged 54. The investigation concluded at the end of a 10 day inquest on 27 January 2023.

The conclusion of the jury was:  
'Death by misadventure. We find that there was gross neglect due to a continuous sequence of shortcomings, including a lack of adequate training on the risks and triggers of patients. Failure to remove ligature risks from bedrooms. Inadequate induction and training of temporary staff'.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by March 27, 2023.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
1. (HEALTHCARE) Lack of safe system, supported by training, guidance, and compliance auditing, for the provision of physical healthcare assessment and monitoring by NEWS2 for acutely unwell patients in a secure setting.

The Jury found shortcomings in the healthcare afforded to Alex at HMP Nottingham in the form of ""continuous failures to provide adequate healthcare, which probably more than minimally contributed to his death"".

I heard evidence that staff were not consistently assessing acutely unwell patients using the NEWS2 system, despite the scoring system having been adopted across the NHS over the past decade and having been adopted by this Trust many years prior.

In 2017, when relaunching the NEWS system, the Royal College of Physicians noted,
""Every so often, someone comes up with an idea that is so obvious, no one can understand why it wasn't thought of before. I am proud that the RCP's National Early Warning Score (NEWS) is one of those initiatives - not just a chart (or iPad) at the end of the bed to record the patient's physical signs and symptoms, but the chart at the end of the bed - a single point of truth to unify recording of symptoms across the NHS, consolidate training for doctors and nurses in the recording of symptoms, and thereby improve patient safety. When the RCP launched the NEWS in 2012, we hoped to see the score adopted across the NHS. What has been more astonishing is the adoption of the score internationally, with requests to use NEWS coming from health services across the world from Europe to India and the USA, including the US Naval Air Forces!""

I heard evidence of an inconsistent application of NEWS2 by staff, an inconsistent awareness of NEWS2 across the staff body, and an absence of clear and robust training supported by guidance, ensuring staff were aware of the expectations of their employer with regards to the use of NEWS2 in monitoring acutely unwell patients.

Sadly, Alex's is not an isolated case. I have been repeatedly assured at a senior level from Nottinghamshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust that they are seeking to embed NEWS2 across their Directorates, yet successive inquests have heard of patients failed by the lack of use of the system by the clinical staff responsible for their medical care. If this issue is not addressed across the Trust, with sufficient urgency, patients will continue to die in Trust settings due to a failure to recognise the
deteriorating patient, and to arrange for timely healthcare intervention.

Further, I heard evidence that the newly implemented compliance audit plans for NEWS2 are not safe or robust because the audit is limited to monitoring the emergency review template on Systmone, which staff are routinely failing to utilise, instead preferring to add free text entries to the running record, which cannot be audited with ease. If the Trust is incapable of monitoring compliance with the initiative, there will be repeated missed opportunities to provide support and guidance to Directorates, wards or individual staff who are deviating from expected practice with regards to NEWS2.

2. (HEALTHCARE AND HMP) The absence of a safe joint system of care (between discipline and healthcare staff) for supporting and managing acutely unwell patients who remain in the prison setting, rather than being transferred to a dedicated healthcare facility.

The very nature of incarceration curtails the prisoner's free movement and ready access to healthcare. Instead, their incarceration places them wholly reliant on the communication between discipline staff on the wing, and healthcare staff available elsewhere within the setting, to obtain timely healthcare assessment and monitoring.

I heard evidence that Alex had been told to ""press his cell bell"" if he ""felt worse"". Both Alex and his cell mate did so repeatedly between 9 and 10 March 2020, with varying degrees of success regarding healthcare attendance at his cell.

Despite discipline and healthcare staff knowing that Alex was suffering with an acute illness, and in the knowledge that there was no plan for him to be transferred to a hospital, there was an absence of agreed joint plan between health and discipline staff as to how often Alex would be seen by each profession, what constitutes a deterioration for him, and what to do in the event of such a deterioration, to seek to detect and manage his risk of physical healthcare deterioration.

In contrast, in circumstances whereby a prisoner is thought to be at risk of self-harm or suicide, there is an agreed joint care planning system (ACCT Version 6) which sets out the clear expectations placed on each profession to seek to keep the prisoner safe (enshrined in Prison Service Instruction). There is no such equivalent system in operation nationally with regards to the risk of physical healthcare deterioration, but that does not absolve each service from ensuring acutely unwell patients are kept safe by way of robust joint local care planning.

If acutely unwell patients continue to be managed in the prison setting without an agreed joint plan of care between health and discipline staff, deaths will continue to occur in these circumstances.

3. (HM PRISON SERVICE) There continues to be a misunderstanding across discipline staff as to what constitutes a CODE BLUE/CODE RED situation, and in what circumstances a cell can be entered by a prison officer for the purpose of preserving life, despite this having been enshrined in Prison Service Instruction for many years.

I heard evidence from the PCO that he erroneously believed it was necessary for 3 discipline staff to be present before a cell door could be opened during night state even in circumstances where Alex was collapsed and unresponsive on the floor.

This is not the first-time issues of this nature have been identified at HMP Nottingham. Indeed, successive Prison and Probation Ombudsman reports have recommended that the Governor take action to address these issues since the cluster of deaths in 2017/2018, and while the prison has been subject to Urgent Notification procedures.

I heard evidence from a medical expert that post-cardiac arrest, every minute which elapses without appropriate CPR and defibrillator use reduces the patient's chances of survival. Timely life support is critical, and staff must be clear on when to call a medical emergency code, and when to enter the cell,
subject to their dynamic risk assessment.

4. (TPP-UK) Amendment of Medical Records without clear evidence of such amendment on the face of the SystmOne patient summary

The vast majority of primary care health services across the community and secure settings, such as prisons, utilise an electronic patient health record known as SystmOne.

I heard evidence that the system automatically records the date, time, and user, shown along the left- hand side of each entry in the printed patient summary, as below.

I was assured by health staff that any retrospective entry or amendment to a previous entry in the patient record would be flagged by a new date and time stamp towards the right-hand side of the entry, as below.

However, in this case, I discovered from scrutinising an audit record, that an entry made in Alex's patient record at 06.46 hours on 10 March 2020, had been amended by way of the deletion of some words, and the addition of others, at 09.30 hours on the same date, without any such time stamp being generated on the right-hand side of the entry. This made it look as if the entire text visible in the record would have been visible from around 06.46 hours that date.

The Head of Healthcare was unable to explain how the health professional who made the entry had been able to amend her previous entry, without it being obvious on the face of the record, after it became apparent Alex was critically unwell

This potentially raises serious safety issues about the integrity of the patient record, and at the very least, if the record is not as robust as first thought by its users, this ought to be made clear. I shall share this report with TPP-UK, the creators of SystmOne, to see if they can explain the safety features in place to ensure amended records are clearly marked as such, especially as in this case, the witness was not
forthcoming about her amendment of Alex's patient record. Accurate record keeping is integral to learning from incidents and seeking to prevent future deaths.","On 06 April 2020, I commenced an investigation into the death of Alexander Michael BRAUND, aged 25. The investigation concluded at the end of an inquest, conducted before a Jury, on 30 November 2022.  

Alex was a remand prisoner at HMP Nottingham, when he became acutely unwell on 6 March 2020, with symptoms of a productive cough (brown sputum) and feeling generally unwell.  He deteriorated such that by the 8 March 2020 he was coughing, vomiting, wheezing, wasn't eating and had a headache.  

Alex and/or his cell mate pressed the emergency buzzer inside their cell at 22.22 hours on 9 March 2020 because Alex had deteriorated further. He had a burning sensation in his chest and difficulty breathing. The nurse attended but did not perform a complete NEWS2 assessment, take a sputum sample, nor listen to his chest. A plan was made to refer Alex to the prison GP the next day.  

There was no agreed plan between healthcare and discipline staff as to whether or how frequently Alex ought to be checked in his cell, what constituted a deterioration of his condition, and what to do in such circumstances.  

At 05.35 hours on 10 March 2020 the emergency cell bell was activated again. Alex's cell mate explained to the PCO that he was increasingly concerned about Alex's condition and that he wanted to see healthcare. Sometime later the nurse attended the wing but did not see Alex. She told the PCO nothing more could be done at this time of night.  Alex was noted to be collapsed on the floor of his cell at 06.55 hours, and his cell mate raised the alarm by pressing the emergency cell bell for the third time. The PCO in charge of the wing failed to clearly establish whether Alex was breathing. There was a delay in entering his cell for the provision of basic life support, and there was a delay in calling a code blue, which in turn delayed the dispatch of an ambulance. These delays probably more than minimally contributed to Alex's death.

Alex was declared deceased at 11.44 hours on 10 March 2020 in the Intensive Care Unit at Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham, following the withdrawal of life support. He had been suffering from an atypical pneumonitis that was not detected.

The continuous failures to provide adequate healthcare to Alex probably more than minimally contributed to his death.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by February 14, 2023.

Ryan was pronounced dead at the scene by attending Paramedics. The driver of the Mazda, sustained life changing injuries.  The collision occurred during the hours of daylight. Visibility was poor due to heavy rain and poor light conditions. The road surface was very wet. The sky was overcast with heavy cloud. 

The court heard the following evidence in connection with road drainage at the scene. 

Coliza Hill Slip Road 
There are gullies on the south-eastern side of the slip road. These were clear of debris at the time of inspection, but due to the steep hill, under conditions of exceptional rainfall, it is possible that a fast flow of water may overwhelm the existing gully grid capacity. A change of camber takes water falling on the lower end of the slip road onto the main carriageway, although this is always likely to be the minor flow. A recommendation has been made by Cormac to enhance the size of or provide additional gully grids for better capture of water above the changeover point, and to minimise surcharge at the lower end of the slip road.

A390 Coliza Hill (eastbound description)
The A390 drains to the north-western side of the road in accordance with standard super elevation of the carriageway for the left-hand bend, until a short distance above the entrance to the layby, when the changeover occurs and water begins to drain along the road and then to the south- eastern side. Gullies intended to capture this water before the changeover point were fleeced over with debris from adjacent trees at the time of site visit. It is not known if this was the case at the time of the collision. Drainage standards have altered since the design and construction of the original A390 improvement, since adopting higher inundation calculations due to anticipated climate change and other factors. Cormac & Cornwall Council are investigating the capacity of the underlying drainage system and outfalls with a view to increasing both the size and number of gullies to improve capture and system resilience.

The Inquest findings of fact were as follows

· There was no evidence of excessive speed or unsafe driving by Ryan at the time of the collision or in the period leading up to the collision. Indeed, there was evidence from other road users that Ryan was driving appropriately for the conditions.

· There was meteorological evidence a large band of heavy rain passing over the location of the collision and that just prior to the collision rainfall of 20 - 30 mm was recorded. Eyewitnesses referred to the driving conditions as being poor due to the heavy rain and excessive water.

· Examination of road drainage at this location revealed that during periods of heavy rainfall surface water from the adjoining road known as Coliza Hill is likely to converge with surface water on the A390 in the vicinity of where the Jaguar initially lost control.

· Ryan was driving a rear wheel drive car. The evidence of the forensic collision investigator was that a rear wheel drive car is more likely to aquaplane in these circumstances than a front wheel drive car.

· The manner in which Ryan's car crossed the carriageway was found to be consistent with a rear wheel drive car aquaplaning in wet conditions. The forensic collision investigator's evidence was that Ryan would have had little or no warning of this sudden loss of control.

From these findings of fact driver error was ruled out. The cause of the collision was found to be the surface water from Coliza Hill converging with surface water on the A390 following heavy rain just prior to the collision. The inquest found that Ryan lost control of his car as he was traversing the converging surface water which had inundated the road at this point. This caused the rear tyres of his vehicle to lose traction with the road surface, either causing it to rotate and suffer a sudden and catastrophic loss of control such as that witnessed by other road users, or causing Ryan to over steer in an attempt to regain control, which would have resulted in the same consequences.","During the course of the inquest the evidence revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows. -
(1) During periods of heavy rainfall surface water from the adjoining road known as Coliza Hill is likely to converge with surface water on the A390 in the vicinity of where Ryan initially lost control of his car.

(2) A rear wheel drive car had been involved in an aquaplaning incident at the same location in similar conditions, four years before this collision.

Improvements to road drainage are feasible in this particular location but have not yet been implemented. These improvements may diminish the risks of vehicles aquaplaning due to converging surface water.","On Monday 18th March 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Ryan Gareth TAYLOR.

In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths will occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows: -
I heard that a key component of the policy to minimize the risk of falls is a thorough understanding of the multifactorial risk assessment process (MFRA)

Whilst I was informed that all adult nurses were made aware of the risk of falls during their nurse training, they are not trained in the use of the MFRA. It is clear that newly qualified nurses rapidly assume responsibility for the care of a group of patients, often before they can undertake the MFRA training.

The senior nurse who gave evidence and presented the internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding Mrs Phipps' death, undertaken by Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, confirmed that it would be beneficial to the safety of patients if MFRA processes were taught to student nurses prior to qualification.",,"In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you have the power to take such action.

I should be grateful if the following information be provided to me:

Hawkins Farm is a family-owned dairy farm. As part of the fabric of some of the buildings on the farm, pre-cast concrete panels were used extensively, predominately as external walls for barns or similar. Typically, the concrete panels, which weigh approximately 800kg, are placed between vertical reinforced steel joists (RSJs), secured to the RSJ by means of a metal bracket bolted to the concrete panel. On Hawkins Farm two concrete panels had been repurposed from another building to form a divide between a ""collecting yard"" (an area where cattle are held prior to be being encouraged into the milking parlour) and an adjacent barn where straw was stored, with one panel placed on top of the other, to form a wall that was approximately 6 feet in height. The concrete panels did not stretch between the two RSJs present. As a consequence, one side was secured using the above-described method, with the other side being secured using sections of steel ""box"" (hollow steel tubing) welded to the RSJ and ""clipped"" against the rear of the concrete panel using a metal bracket. On 30th January 2021, Mr Woods was in the collecting yard when the upper concrete panel that divided the collecting yard from the straw storage came away from its fixing, causing multiple injuries to Mr Woods, who was sadly confirmed deceased at the scene.","The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:

1. During the inquest evidence was heard that:

i. The sections of box tubing used to secure one end of the concrete panels to the vertical RSJ was a weaker method of securing the concrete panels in place, as compared to the method typically used (securing the panel directly to the RSJ using metal brackets bolted to the rear of the panel). They had been in place for a number of years and would have appeared to have been present when Hawkins Farm was subject to inspections by outside agencies, yet no remedial action was required.

2. I have concerns with regard to the following:

i. Pre-cast concrete panels are likely extensively used across farms throughout England and Wales. The equipment required to move panels between buildings is likely to be available on the majority of farms, meaning that there is a significant risk that farm owners/workers will move panels if necessary without the need to refer to external trades/professionals. As a consequence, there is a risk of the panels subsequently being fastened to vertical RSJs in a less secure manner, as occurred on Hawkins Farm. A collapsing concrete panel poses a clear risk of death, given their weight.

There appears to be a lack of understanding of the importance of securing the panels in the optimal manner. It does not appear to have been understood by those working on the farm that the fixings that were used on the panel that collapsed were weaker, neither does it appear to have been appreciated by those that undertook inspections of the farm subsequent to the use of this weaker method of fixing. Publicising the risks and educating the farmers of the risks of departing from the recognised method of fixing the pre-cast concrete panels may reduce the risk of future deaths.","On the 5th February 2021, an investigation was commenced into the death of Jamie Paul Woods, born on the 12th August 1980. 

The investigation concluded at the end of the Inquest on the 7th December 2022.

Resuscitation algorithm (4 H's & 4 T's)* for PEA cardiac arrest
I heard evidence that the 4 H's and 4 T's should be considered and excluded in any PEA cardiac arrest situation. Steps were taken to treat anaphylaxis, but in the absence of any improvement in Teegan's clinical condition, and whilst it was mentioned, no steps were taken to exclude possible bilateral tension pneumothoraces. Evidence was heard at the Inquest that it is the only one of the 4 H's and 4 T's (see footnote) that directly results in a sudden inability to ventilate, with the HSIB report indicating that there was sufficient time to consider and exclude this possibility given the length of time of the PEA cardiac arrest.

2.Surgical emphysem
There was a delay in the recognition of surgical emphysema by clinical attendees at the cardiac arrest (medical specialist registrar, consultant obstetricians, anaesthetic core trainee, anaesthetic specialist registrar and the on call consultant anaesthetist) despite indicative clinical signs of deep cyanosis, gross whole body swelling with the need to remove the increasingly constrictive hospital wrist band and endotracheal tube tie, alongside sub-cutaneous crepitus and an abdominal drainage bag noted to be tense with air.

3. Investigation after Teegan's death
Following this incident, and despite Teegan being intubated and ventilated at the time, with a real possibility of this being an anaesthetic related event, no steps were taken by the anaesthetic department at St Richard's Hospital, Chichester, either before or after the publication of the HSIB report, to explore potential iatrogenic or other anaesthetic related causes (such as exposure of Teegan's lungs to excessive volume or pressure) as a possible or probable cause of Teegan's death.

Furthermore, the anaesthetic machine/ventilator was not taken out of service and assessed to see if there was a fault. Neither was the data from the anaesthetic machine downloaded and interrogated, which may have assisted in establishing how Teegan came to develop bilateral tension pneumothoraces during her emergence from general anaesthesia.

The failure of the anaesthetic department to undertake any morbidity or mortality review/meeting following Teegan's death led to a lost opportunity to share any possible learning opportunities both within and outside their department to prevent future deaths, and as a corollary to have been in a position to fully assist both the investigation by the HSIB and the inquest hearing.

4.Trust Clinical Governance procedures
The senior management team within the Trust have not acknowledged that there was a lack of a proper and robust system in place to trigger an investigation into all the circumstances of the death of a 17-year-old patient, with no steps taken by them to do so either before or after the publication of the HSIB report or at any time prior to the Inquest hearing.

This gives rise to a concern of a lack of insight within the senior management team of the importance of undertaking a comprehensive investigation into unexpected deaths within their organisation and for there to be wider dissemination of any institutional learning with the aim of preventing future deaths.

The failure of the Trust to fully investigate how Teegan came by her death also gives rise to a concern regarding the Trust's obligation to comply with the Statutory Duty of Candour and their requirement to share their findings with both the regulators and Teegan's family as well as to indicate the steps, if any, they have taken to prevent future deaths.

22/06/2023,2023-0209,Stephen Richardson,Andre Rebello,Liverpool and Wirral,Mental Health related deaths,NHS England &amp; NHS Improvement and Department of Health and Social Care,https://www.judiciary.uk/prevention-of-future-death-reports/stephen-richardson-prevention-of-future-deaths-report/,https://www.judiciary.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stephen-Richardson-Prevention-of-future-deaths-report-2023-0209_Published.pdf,"i.The Jury found,

ii. Self-inflicted ligature on 24th September 2019 at Sid Watkins Unit. Stephen Norman Richardson is a male who was 47 years of age at his time of death. Stephen had suffered with treatment resistant paranoid schizophrenia, from the age of 18.

iii.Following a number of medications being unsuccessful in managing Stephen's condition and also a long period of inpatient treatment, Stephen was prescribed clozapine in 2006. Clozapine allowed Stephen to live independently and be able to mostly manage his mental well-being.

iv. Stephen was regularly monitored by blood testing and in 2018, he had a number of results which concluded that clozapine could no longer be used to treat Stephen's condition.

v.The Jury have reached the conclusion that it was reasonable to stop the clozapine at this time. However, the Jury are of the view that there were missed opportunities to treat the neutropenia with a view to restart clozapine and also no exploration of whether other medication that Stephen was prescribed could have been the cause of his neutropenia, rather than clozapine.

vi.Almost immediately following clozapine being stopped Stephen's mental health deteriorated. On the 20th May 2018 there was a marked deterioration in Stephen's mental health. A schedule of daily visits was put in place in recognition of this.

vii. On 24th May 2018 there was a further deterioration in Stephen's mental health. The view at this time was that Stephen met the criteria to be sectioned under the Mental Health Act. However, he was not sectioned at this time and the Jury heard that this was due to no bed being available on an acute mental health unit.

viii.Stephen was advised that the plan for him was to be admitted to hospital 2 days later. A plan was put in place for the community crisis team to visit Stephen at his home at least twice a day.

ix.On the 26th May 2019 Stephen was still not admitted or sectioned under the Mental Health Act.

x.Visits from the Mental Health Team had not been completed as previously discussed. On May 29th Stephen was visited and the conclusion from this visit was that Stephen should be prioritised for admission.

xiii. Later on that day Stephen attempted to hang himself.

xiv. The Jury are of the conclusion that the failure to secure a bed on an acute Mental Health Unit for Stephen was a gross failure that contributed to the attempted hanging. Furthermore, this failure also contributed to Stephen sustaining a hypoxic brain injury, and the damage he sustained to his throat, which resulted in Stephen needing to be peg fed.

xv. Whilst as an inpatient at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, Stephen's behaviour became cause for concern, this resulted in the plan for Stephen being that he would be admitted to Clock View rather than the Brain Injury Unit, A bed was found on 28th June 2019. Stephen became an inpatient at Clock View 2nd July 2019.

xvi. Stephen was viewed as having a settled period at Clock View.

xvii. On 11th July 2019 Stephen was transferred to the Brain Injury Unit, this was described as an emergency transfer due to the need for his bed to be used by another patient.

xviii. The Jury are in agreement with Stephen's family in that this transfer was not in Stephen's best interest, as there had been no plan of care established for Stephen at the time of transfer. Whilst being an inpatient at the Brain Injury Unit, there were incidents of Stephen assaulting staff. Due to these incidents Stephen was returned to Clock View on 24th July 2019.

xix. On 14th August 2019[REDACTED] was found outside Stephen's room, when asked about the[REDACTED], Stephen said that it fell out of his pants.

xx. Following this incident a written record was made and the information was verbally shared at the start of the handover. However there was no alteration to Stephen's risk assessment.

xxi. In addition to this there was no safeguarding plan implemented to reflect the incident and any possible related risks.

xxii. The jury have noted that, prior to the cord being found Stephen had requested to call his mother. Following Stephen being unable to contact his mother the cord was found.

xxiii. The jury have concluded that non-completion of the risk assessment document was in itself a significant failure. On discussion of a transfer back to the Brain Injury Unit family shared concerns as to the ligature risks, and the loss of protective factors such as familiarity with his surroundings and staff.

xxiv. At the unit family were also in disagreement with a transfer to the Brain Injury Unit at this stage due to their views that the physical environment at the unit being a risk to Stephen.

xxv. Following an assessment of Stephen a phased transfer plan was proposed.

xxvi. The Jury have concluded that this was a significant failure in that this plan was not communicated to relevant persons.

xxvii. In addition to this the Jury conclude that in the one instance that the plan was shared it was misunderstood by bed management. This is viewed by the jury as a missed opportunity for Stephen.

xxviii. Despite the proposed phased return to the Brain Injury Unit and the concerns raised by the family Stephen was transferred with immediate effect on the 16th September 2019. Between 7th September 2019 and the 25th September 2019, no risk assessment was completed either by Clock View or the Brain Injury Unit.

xxix. The Jury concluded that this was a serious missed opportunity as there was an absence of documentation to inform care planning and safeguarding steps for Stephen.

xxx. Documentation that was completed for Stephen prior to 24th September 2019 recorded occasions of Stephen having suicidal thoughts.

xxxi. It is also documented that Stephen had a recognition of his thoughts at this time and requested support in an effect to keep himself safe.

xxxii. On the day of the ligature incident (24th September) observations from ward staff state that he was settled, watched TV, spent time in his room, showered, went shopping and wash and dried his clothes. Stephen's sister also visited him that evening.

xxxiii. Following the staff handover on the ward, Stephen's observations show that there was a change in Stephen's presentation. He is noted as refusing his medication, refusing access to his room and throwing an item around his room. Stephen is also recorded in observations as being anxious. The Jury heard in evidence that there was no qualified mental health nurse on shift working that evening.

xxxiv. Stephen's behaviour continued and a decision was made to allow him to have time to calm down. At 23:20 Stephen spoke to staff to request that he could make a telephone call to his mother. Stephen was bare chested and he was asked to put a top on but refused to do this.

xxxv. At 23:40 Stephen repeated his request to call his mother again. He was told that he could use the phone in the office, but refused and said that he had changed his mind, saying it did not matter.

xxxvi.A short time later staff noticed that Stephen's room was in darkness. A light on a mobile phone was shone into the room, This was in an attempt to see where Stephen was in the room. The door of Stephen's room was found to be barricaded and the jury heard in evidence that it took 4 - 6 minutes to clear the barricade and enter the room.

xxxvii.Evidence was also given that no noise was heard at any time of Stephen barricading his bedroom door. On entering the bedroom, Stephen was found ligatured behind the bathroom door.

xxviii. It has been discussed in court that the procedure to be followed at the Brain Injury Unit in such circumstances is to call 2222 and 999 to alert emergency services. Although staff called 999 at 23:53 no call was made to 2222. The Jury have concluded that there were missed opportunities due to there being no knowledge of the correct procedures to follow.

xxxix.However it is acknowledged that this failure would not have altered the outcome for Stephen. The Jury also conclude that lack of communication between persons on duty was a failure to respond appropriately to Stephen's behaviours.

xl.For example, there was no information shared as to the[REDACTED] being found 4 weeks earlier. The sharing of the incident could have allowed for additional risk planning.

xli.As a jury we would like to offer Stephen's family our sincere condolences.

xlii. Stephen was transferred to ICU at University Hospital Aintree on the 24th September 2019 and sadly passed on 28th September 2019. As a result of his extensive brain damage the decision was made by his family to withdraw his life support. Stephen was pronounced dead.""","During the course of the investigation my inquiries revealed matters giving rise to concern. In my opinion there is a risk that future deaths could occur unless action is taken. In the circumstances it is my statutory duty to report to you.

The MATTERS OF CONCERN are as follows:
(brief summary of matters of concern)

It was clear from the investigation that at the time of Stephen ligaturing in May 2019 there was an national shortage of acute pyschiatric beds to treat patients in the community suffering with mental disorder of a nature or degree which necessitated immediate assessment treatment and care as an inpatient. The evidence heard has confirmed that that parlous situation has not improved.","On 04 October 2019 I commenced an investigation into the death of Stephen Norman RICHARDSON aged 47. The investigation concluded at the end of the inquest on 22 June 2023. 

The conclusion of the inquest was that:  
Stephen Norman Richardson died from the effects of a self-inflicted ligature [REDACTED], however his intention in doing so remains unclear as the evidence presented Stephen had a fear of dying by suicide.",In my opinion action should be taken to prevent future deaths and I believe you (and/or your organisation) have the power to take such action.,"You are under a duty to respond to this report within 56 days of the date of this report, namely by August 17, 2023. I, the coroner, may extend the period.

Your response must contain details of action taken or proposed to be taken, setting out the timetable for action. Otherwise you must explain why no action is proposed.","I make this report under paragraph 7, Schedule 5, of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 and regulations 28 and 29 of the Coroners (Investigations) Regulations 2013.","[('toxicity', 0.36100828647613525), ('vagal inhibition', 0.35707131028175354), ('debility of old age', 0.35687315464019775), ('general system failure', 0.3539905846118927), ('injury', 0.35317352414131165)]"
